How to Build an H-Bomb Making and owning an H-bomb is the kind of challenge real Americans seek. Who wants to be a passive victim of nuclear war when, with a little effort, you can be an active participant? Bomb shelters are for losers. Who wants to huddle together underground eating canned Spam? Winners want to push the button themselves. Making your own H-bomb is a big step in nuclear assertiveness training -- it's called Taking Charge. We're sure you'll enjoy the risks and the heady thrill of playing nuclear chicken. Introduction When the Feds clamped down on The Progressive magazine for attempting to publish an article on the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb, it piqued our curiosity. Was it really true that atomic and hydrogen bomb technology was so simple you could build an H-bomb in your own kitchen? Seven Days decided to find out. Food editor Barbara Ehrenreich, investigative reporter Peter Biskind, Photographer Jane Melnick and nuclear scientist Michio Kaku were given three days to cook up a workable H-bomb. They did and we have decided to share their culinary secrets with you. Not that Seven Days supports nuclear terrorism. We don't. We would prefer to die slowly from familiar poisons like low-level radiation, microwaves, DDT, DBCP, aflatoxins, PBBs, PBCs, or food dyes, rather than unexpectedly, say as hostage to a Latvian nationalist brandishing a homemade bomb. In our view the real terrorists are the governments, American, Soviet, French, Chinese, and British, that are hoarding H-bombs for their own use, and worse still, those governments (U.S., French and German) that are eagerly peddling advanced nuclear technology to countries like South Africa, Brazil, and Argentina so that they can make their own bombs. When these bombs are used, and they will be, it will be the world's big-time nuclear peddlers, along with corporate suppliers like General Electric, Westinghouse, and Gulf Oil, that we can thank for it. Gagging The Progressive will do no more for national security than backyard bomb shelters because like it or not the news is out. The heart of the successful H-bomb is the successful A-bomb. Once you've got your A-bombs made the rest is frosting on the cake. All you have to do is set them up so that when they detonate they'll start off a hydrogen-fusion reaction.  Part 1: Making Your Bomb Step 1: Getting the Ingredients Uranium is the basic ingredient of the A-bomb. When a uranium atom's nucleus splits apart, it releases a tremendous amount of energy (for its size), and it emits neutrons which go on to split other nearby uranium nuclei, releasing more energy, in what is called a 'chain reaction'. (When atoms split, matter is converted into energy according to Einstein's equation E=MC2. What better way to mark his birthday than with your own atomic fireworks?) There are two kinds (isotopes) of uranium: the rare U-235, used in bombs, and the more common, heavier, but useless U-238. Natural uranium contains less than 1 percent U-235 and in order to be usable in bombs it has to be 'enriched' to 90 percent U-235 and only 10 percent U-238. Plutonium-239 can also be used in bombs as a substitute for U-235. Ten pounds of U-235 (or slightly less plutonium) is all that is necessary for a bomb. Less than ten pounds won't give you a critical mass. So purifying or enriching naturally occurring uranium is likely to be your first big hurdle. It is infinitely easy to steal ready-to-use enriched uranium or plutonium than to enrich some yourself. And stealing uranium is not as hard as it sounds. There are at least three sources of enriched uranium or plutonium... Enriched uranium is manufactured at a gaseous diffusion plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. From there it is shipped in 10 liter bottles by airplane and trucks to conversion plants that turn it into uranium oxide or uranium metal. Each 10 liter bottle contains 7 kilograms of U-235, and there are 20 bottles to a typical shipment. Conversion facilities exist at Hematite, Missouri; Apollo, Pennsylvania; and Erwin, Tennessee. The Kerr-McGee plant at Crescent Oklahoma -- where Karen Silkwood worked -- was a conversion plant that 'lost' 40 lbs of plutonium. Enriched uranium can be stolen from these plants or from fuel-fabricating plants like those in New Haven, San Diego; or Lynchburg, Virginia. (A former Kerr-McGee supervisor, James V. Smith, when asked at the Silkwood trial if there were any security precautions at the plant to prevent theft, testified that 'There were none of any kind, no guards, no fences, no nothing.') Plutonium can be obtained from places like United Nuclear in Pawling, New York; Nuclear Fuel Services in Erwin, Tennessee; General Electric in Pleasanton, California; Westinghouse in Cheswick, Pennsylvania; Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC) in Leechburg, Pennsylvania; and plants in Hanfford, Washington and Morris, Illinois. According to Rolling Stone magazine the Israelis were involved in the theft of plutonium from NUMEC. Finally you can steal enriched uranium or plutonium while it's en-route from conversion plants to fuel fabricating plants. It is usually transported (by air or truck) in the form of uranium oxide, a brownish powder resembling instant coffee, or as a metal, coming in small chunks called 'broken buttons.' Both forms are shipped in small cans stacked in 5-inch cylinders braced with welded struts in the center of ordinary 55 gallon steel drums. The drums weigh about 100 pounds and are clearly marked 'Fissible Material' or 'Danger, Plutonium.' A typical shipment might go from the enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio to the conversion plant in Hematite Missouri then to Kansas City by truck where it would be flown to Los Angeles and then trucked down to the General Atomic plant in San Diego. The plans for the General Atomic plant are on file at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's reading room at 1717 H Street NW Washington. A Xerox machine is provided for the convenience of the public. If you can't get hold of any enriched uranium you'll have to settle for commercial grade (20 percent U-235). This can be stolen from university reactors of a type called TRIGA Mark II, where security is even more casual than at commercial plants. If stealing uranium seems too tacky you can buy it. Unenriched uranium is available at any chemical supply house for $23 a pound. Commercial grade (3 to 20 percent enriched) is available for $40 a pound from Gulf Atomic. You'll have to enrich it further yourself. Quite frankly this can be something of a pain in the ass. You'll need to start with a little more than 50 pounds of commercial-grade uranium. (It's only 20 percent U-235 at best, and you need 10 pounds of U-235 so... ) But with a little kitchen-table chemistry you'll be able to convert the solid uranium oxide you've purchased into a liquid form. Once you've done that, you'll be able to separate the U-235 that you'll need from the U-238. First pour a few gallons of concentrated hydrofluoric acid into your uranium oxide, converting it to uranium tetrafluoride. (Safety note: Concentrated hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will eat its way through glass, so store it only in plastic. Used 1-gallon plastic milk containers will do.) Now you have to convert your uranium tetrafluoride to uranium hexafluoride, the gaseous form of uranium, which is convenient for separating out the isotope U-235 from U-238. To get the hexafluoride form, bubble fluorine gas into your container of uranium tetrafluoride. Fluorine is available in pressurized tanks from chemical-supply firms. Be careful how you use it though because fluorine is several times more deadly than chlorine, the classic World War I poison gas. Chemists recommend that you carry out this step under a stove hood (the kind used to remove unpleasant cooking odors). If you've done your chemistry right you should now have a generous supply of uranium hexafluoride ready for enriching. In the old horse-and-buggy days of A-bomb manufacture the enrichment was carried out by passing the uranium hexafluoride through hundreds of miles of pipes, tubes, and membranes, until the U-235 was eventually separated from the U-238. This gaseous-diffusion process, as it was called is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Gaseous-diffusion plants cover hundreds of acres and cost in the neighborhood of $2-billion each. So forget it. There are easier, and cheaper, ways to enrich your uranium. First transform the gas into a liquid by subjecting it to pressure. You can use a bicycle pump for this. Then make a simple home centrifuge. Fill a standard-size bucket one-quarter full of liquid uranium hexafluoride. Attach a six-foot rope to the bucket handle. Now swing the rope (and attached bucket) around your head as fast as possible. Keep this up for about 45 minutes. Slow down gradually, and very gently put the bucket on the floor. The U-235, which is lighter, will have risen to the top, where it can be skimmed off like cream. Repeat this step until you have the required 10 pounds of uranium. (Safety note: Don't put all your enriched uranium hexafluoride in one bucket. Use at least two or three buckets and keep them in separate corners of the room. This will prevent the premature build-up of a critical mass.) Now it's time to convert your enriched uranium back to metal form. This is easily enough accomplished by spooning several ladlefuls of calcium (available in tablet form from your drugstore) into each bucket of uranium. The calcium will react with the uranium hexafluoride to produce calcium fluoride, a colorless salt which can be easily be separated from your pure enriched uranium metal. A few precautions: â¢ While uranium is not dangerously radioactive in the amounts you'll be handling, if you plan to make more than one bomb it might be wise to wear gloves and a lead apron, the kind you can buy in dental supply stores. â¢ Plutonium is one of the most toxic substances known. If inhaled, a thousandth of a gram can cause massive fibrosis of the lungs, a painful way to go. Even a millionth of a gram in the lungs will cause cancer. If eaten plutonium is metabolized like calcium. It goes straight to the bones where it gives out alpha particles preventing bone marrow from manufacturing red blood cells. The best way to avoid inhaling plutonium is to hold your breath while handling it. If this is too difficult wear a mask. To avoid ingesting plutonium orally follow this simple rule: never make an A-bomb on an empty stomach. â¢ If you find yourself dozing off while you're working, or if you begin to glow in the dark, it might be wise to take a blood count. Prick your finger with a sterile pin, place a drop of blood on a microscope slide, cover it with a cover slip, and examine under a microscope. (Best results are obtained in the early morning.) When you get leukemia, immature cells are released into the bloodstream, and usually the number of white cells increases (though this increase might take almost 2 weeks). Red blood cells look kind of like donuts (without the hole), and are slightly smaller than the white cells, each of which has a nucleus. Immature red cells look similar to white cells (i.e.. slightly larger and have a nucleus). If you have more than about 1 white cell (including immature ones) to 400 red cells then start to worry. But, depending upon your plans for the eventual use of the bomb, a short life expectancy might not be a problem.  Step 2: Assembling the A-Bomb Now that you've acquired the enriched uranium, all that's left is to assemble your A-bomb. Go find a couple of stainless steel salad bowls. You also want to separate your 10 pounds of U-235 into two hunks. (Keep them apart!) The idea is to push each half your uranium into the inside of a bowl. Take one hunk of your uranium and beat it into the inside of the first bowl. Uranium is malleable, like gold, so you should have no trouble hammering it into the bowl to get a good fit. Take another five-pound hunk of uranium and fit it into a second stainless steel bowl. These two bowls of U-235 are the 'subcritical masses' which, when brought together forcefully, will provide the critical mass that makes your A-bomb go. Keep them a respectful distance apart while working because you don't want them to 'go critical' on you... At least not yet. Now hollow out the body of an old vacuum cleaner and place your two hemispherical bowls inside, open ends facing each other, no less than seven inches apart, using masking tape to set them up in position. The reason for the steel bowls and the vacuum cleaner, in case you're wondering, is that these help reflect the neutrons back into the uranium for a more efficient explosion. 'A loose neutron is a useless neutron' as the A-bomb pioneers used to say. As far as the A-bomb goes, you're almost done. The final problem is to figure out how to get the two U-235 hemispheres to smash into each other with sufficient force to set off a truly effective fission reaction. Almost any type of explosive can be used to drive them together. Gunpowder, for example, is easily made at home from potassium nitrate, sulfur, and carbon. Or, you can get some blasting caps or TNT. (Buy them or steal them from a construction site.) Best of all is C4 plastic explosive. You can mold it around your bowls, and it's fairly safe to work with. (But, it might be wise to shape it around an extra salad bowl in another room, and THEN fit it to your uranium-packed bowls. This is particularly true in winter, when a stray static electrical charge might induce ignition in the C4. A responsible bomb maker considers it impolite to accidentally destroy more of the neighborhood than absolutely necessary.) Once the explosives are in place all you need to do is hook up a simple detonation device with a few batteries, a switch, and some wire. Remember though that it is essential that the two charges -- one on each side of the casing -- go off simultaneously. Now put the whole thing in the casing of an old Hoover vacuum cleaner and you're finished with this part of the process. The rest is easy.  Step 3: Make More A-Bombs Following the Directions Above  A Word to the Wise About Wastes After your A-bomb is completed you'll have a pile of moderately fatal radioactive wastes like U-238. These are not dangerous, but you do have to get rid of them. You can flush leftovers down the toilet. (Don't worry about polluting the ocean, there is already so much radioactive waste there, a few more bucketfuls won't make any waves whatsoever.) If you're the fastidious type -- the kind who never leaves gum under their seat at the movies -- you can seal the nasty stuff in coffee cans and bury it in the backyard, just like Uncle Sam does. If the neighbor kids have a habit of trampling the lawn, tell them to play over by the waste. You'll soon find that they're spending most of their time in bed.  Going First Class If you're like us, you're feeling the economic pinch, and you'll want to make your bomb as inexpensively as possible, consonant of course with reasonable yield. The recipe we've given is for a budget-pleasing H-bomb, no frills, no flourishes; it's just a simple 5-megaton bomb, capable of wiping out the New York metropolitan area, the San Francisco Bay area, or Boston. But don't forget, your H-bomb will only be as good as the A-bombs in it. If you want to spend a little more money you can punch-up your A-bomb considerably. Instead of centrifuging your uranium by hand, you can buy a commercial centrifuge. (Fisher Scientific sells one for about $1000.) You also might want to be fussier about your design. The Hiroshima bomb, a relatively crude one, only fissioned 1 percent of it's uranium and yielded only 13 kilotons. In order to fission more of the uranium, the force of your explosive 'trigger' needs to be evenly diffused around the sphere; the same pressure has to be exerted on every point of the sphere simultaneously. (It was a technique for producing this sort of simultaneous detonation by fashioning the explosives into lenses that the government accused Julius and Ethel Rosenberg of trying to steal).  Part 2: Putting Your H-Bomb Together The heart of the H-bomb is the fusion process. Several A-bombs are detonated in such a way as to create the extremely high temperature (100 million degrees C) necessary to fuse lithium deuteride (LiD) into helium. When the lithium nucleus slams into the deuterium nucleus, two helium nuclei are created, and if this happens to enough deuterium nuclei rapidly enough, the result is an enormous amount of energy: the energy of the H-bomb. You don't have to worry about stealing lithium deuteride, it can be purchased from any chemical-supply house. It costs $1000 a pound. If your budget won't allow it you can substitute lithium hydride at $40 a pound. You will need at least 100 pounds. It's a corrosive and toxic powder so be careful. Place the lithium deuteride or hydride in glass jars and surround it with four A-bombs in their casings. Attach them to the same detonator so that they will go off simultaneously. The container for the whole thing is no problem. They can be placed anywhere: Inside an old stereo console, a discarded refrigerator, etc... When the detonator sets off the four A-bombs all eight hemispheres of fissionable material will slam into each other at the same time creating four critical masses and four detonations. This will raise the temperature of the lithium deuteride to 100 million degrees C fast enough (a few billionths of a second) so that the lithium will not be blown all over the neighborhood before the nuclei have time to fuse. The result, at least 1000 times the punch of the puny A-bomb that leveled Hiroshima (20 million tons of TNT vs. 20 thousand tons.)  Part 3: What to do With Your Bomb Now that you have a fully assembled H-bomb housed in an attractive console of your choice you may be wondering, 'What should I do with it?' Every family will have to answer this question according to its own tastes and preferences, but you may want to explore some possibilities which have been successfully pioneered by the American government. 1. Sell Your Bomb and Make a Pile of Money In these days of rising inflation, increasing unemployment, and an uncertain economic outlook, few businesses make as much sense as weapons production. If your career forecast is cloudy, bomb sales may be the only sure way to avoid the humiliation of receiving welfare, or unemployment. Regardless of your present income level, a home H-bomb business can be an invaluable income supplement, and certainly a profitable alternative to selling Tupperware or pirated Girl Scout cookies. Unfortunately for the family bomb business, big government has already cornered a large part of the world market. But this does not mean that there is a shortage of potential customers. The raid on Entebee was the Waterloo of hijacking, and many nationalist groups are now on the alert for new means to get their message across. They'd jump at the chance to get hold of an H-bomb. Emerging nations which can't ante up enough rice or sugar to buy themselves a reactor from G.E. or Westinghouse are also shopping around. You may wonder about the ethics of selling to nations, or groups, whose goals you may disapprove of. But here again, take a tip from our government: forget ideology -- it's cash that counts. And remember, H-bomb sales have a way of escalating, almost like a chain reaction. Suppose you make a sale to South Yemen which you believe to be a Soviet puppet. Well within a few days some discrete inquiries from North Yemen and possibly the Saudis, the Egyptians and the Ethiopians as well can be expected. Similarly, a sale to the IRA will generate a sale to the Ulster government; and a sale to the Tanzanians will bring the Ugandans running, and so forth. It doesn't matter WHICH side you're on, only how many sides there are. Don't forget about the possibility of repeat sales to the same customer. As the experience of both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. has shown, each individual nation has a potentially infinite need for H-bombs. No customer -- no matter how small -- can ever have too many. 2. Use Your Bomb at Home Many families are attracted to the H-bomb simply as a 'deterrent.' A discrete sticker on the door or on the living room window saying 'This Home Protected by H-bomb' will discourage IRS investigators, census takers, and Jehovah's Witnesses. You'll be surprised how fast the crime rate will go down and property values will go up. And once the news gets out that you are a home H-bomb owner you'll find that you have unexpected leverage in neighborhood disputes over everything from parking places and stereo noise levels to school tax rates. So relax and enjoy the pride and excitement of home H-bomb ownership!  Is It For You? Let's be honest. The H-bomb isn't for everyone. Frankly there are people who can't handle it. They break out in hives at the very mention of mega-death, fallout, or radiation sickness. The following quiz will help you find out whether you have what it takes for home H-bomb ownership. If you can answer 'yes' to six or more of these questions, then you're emotionally eligible to join the nuclear club. If not, a more conventional weapon may be more your cup of tea, try botulism-toxin, laser rays, or nerve gas. 1. I ignore the demands of others. 2. I subscribe to one or more of the following: Soldier of Fortune, Hustler, Popular Mechanics, Self. 3. Though I have many interesting acquaintances, I am my own best friend. 4. I know what to say after you say 'Hello,' but I am seldom interested in pursuing the conversation. 5. I have seen the movie 'The Deer Hunter' more than once. 6. I know that everyone can be a winner if they want to, and I resent whiners. 7. I own one or more of the following: handgun, video game, trash compactor, snowmobile. 8. I am convinced that leukemia is psychosomatic. 9. I am aware that most vegetarians are sexually impotent. 10. I have read evidence that solar energy is a Communist conspiracy.  Myths About Nuclear War Ever since the first mushroom cloud over Hiroshima ushered in the atomic age, a small group of nay-sayers and doom-mongers has lobbied, campaigned and demonstrated to convince Americans that H-bomb ownership, along with nuclear power, is dangerous and unhealthy. Using their virtual stranglehold over the media, these people have tried to discredit everything nuclear from energy to war. They have vastly overrated the risks of nuclear bombs and left many Americans feeling demoralized and indecisive; not sure where the truth lies. Well, here are the myths, and here are the facts. Myth: After a nuclear exchange the earth will no longer be suitable for human habitation. Fact: This is completely false. According to one scientist (quoted in John McPee's The Curve of Binding Energy) 'The largest bomb that has ever been exploded anywhere was 60 megatons, and that is one-thousandth the force of an earthquake, one-thousandth the force of a hurricane. We have lived with earthquakes and hurricanes for a long time.' Another scientist adds, 'It is often assumed that a full blown nuclear war would be the end of life on earth. That is far from the truth. To end life on earth would take at least a thousand times the total yield of all the nuclear explosives existing in the world, and probably a lot more.' Even if humans succumbed, many forms of life would survive a nuclear free-for-all, cockroaches, certain forms of bacteria, and lichens, for instance. Myth: Radiation is bad for you. Fact: Everything is bad for you if you have too much of it. If you eat too many bananas you'll get a stomach-ache. If you get too much sun you can get sunburned (or even skin cancer). Same thing with radiation. Too much may make you feel under the weather, but nuclear industry officials insist that there is no evidence that low-level radiation has any really serious adverse effects. And, high-level radiation may bring unexpected benefits. It speeds up evolution by weeding out unwanted genetic types and creating new ones. (Remember the old saying, 'Two heads are better than one.') Nearer to home, it's plain that radiation will get rid of pesky crab grass and weeds, and teenagers will find that brief exposure to a nuclear burst vaporizes acne and other skin blemishes. (Many survivors of the Hiroshima bomb found that they were free from skin and it's attendant problems forever.) We hope this clears up any misconceptions you may have had. Enjoy your H-Bomb!

Thanks to Yahoo!'s Toolbar I can now 'capture' the URLs of popups...which means now I can show you some cool links to Korean Pop (K-Pop) audio and video without the need to relate instructions like: 'go to the site, click on the pop-audio button then choose...'.  So, without further ado here is the link to 24-hour K-Pop  urlLink audio  and the  urlLink video  streaming.  Enjoy.
I had an interesting conversation with my Dad this morning.  We were talking about where Koreans put their money.  Invariably, they have a lot of real estate and cash.  (Cash would include short term investments under one year as well as savings accounts.)  The reason?  Real estate makes money here.  A lot of money.  I've seen surveys of Seoul real estate rising about 10-15% PER YEAR for long stretches, even after taking into account the 1997 Crisis (referred to as the IMF crisis here, although it was the IMF that bailed Korea out).  Compare that to Korean corporate bonds which fell 90-99% in 1997 and only modestly recovered, and a local stock market (represented by KOSPI, or their version of the Dow Jones Index) that has not gone appreciably above its 1980s high of 1,000 points (it is now about 800 points, see  urlLink link ) and you can see why real estate makes sense here.  But back to the conversation...I noted that here a 'real big' or 'elite' real estate investor has over 6 billion won (about USD 5,000,000, see  urlLink converter ) in properties.  Dad seemed a little flabbergasted.  'What the heck do they need 5 million dollars for?  They don't need that much to retire.'  Maybe so, but there is a lot of risk here too.  Take real estate (or any other South Korean asset) for example: if the North toots their horn louder or make a move on the country that 5,000,000 USD is worth about 5 cents.  Also, all of it is denominated in won which, during the 'IMF Crisis', dropped about 50% vis-a-vis the USD. Also, if you make a bad investment or some fall victim to a scam--the latest here was the  urlLink Good Morning City  project--you're toast.  I saw a lady on TV who lost everything in it.  Her comment (between the tears): 'Now I know what it's like to go from a rich person to a beggar in one day.'  If you have one of those, some saber-rattling from North Korea and a weak exchange rate your little nest egg could be almost wiped out.  The government has almost zero help for unemployed, disabled or otherwise disenfranchised workers.  The role of family is more important here...so if you have money you should help your family, and if you don't then you should go to them first.  Thus the idea that more is more.  Koreans go all out in most things they do, and investing is no different.  Why have one apartment when you can have 7?  The  urlLink jeonse  system supports this as well.  You see, if you have a 400,000 USD apartment and you rent it out there are two systems you can use in Korea (neither of which are the Western ones, except in rare circumstances).  1.  Renter signs a 2-year contract and deposits about half the market value (200,000 USD) with the owner.  No monthly rent is paid, but the owner can invest in Korean Treasury Bills for about 4-5% per year.  That's a monthly rent/return of $750.  At the end of the term the 200,000 USD is returned to the renter.  2.  Renter signs a 1-year or 2-year contract and deposits about 10%-20% of the market value of the property (10,000-20,000 USD) plus some monthly rent of $400-$600 a month.  In both cases, if the value of the property increases or decreases the jeonse will need to be topped-up or partially refunded.  (Of course I'm using USD in this to save my '0' key and to help 'foreigners' reference it better.)  Thus, if you buy a place for $400,000 you can turn around and rent it out and get $200,000 to (if you like) buy another place or whatever.  Since there are very, very few mortgages in Korea (kind of a cash society, although there are home-equity lines of credit) the system here is a bit different.  The key, of course, is that real estate prices keep going up.
Somehow Coca-Cola has a way of summing up things so well.  In the early 1970s they had as their flagship jingle 'I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke' (to the tune of 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing') that pretty much summed up the post-Woodstock era so well.  It didn't add much to sales, but it was a catchy tune.  In Korea Coke's theme is  urlLink Stop Thinking. Feel it.  which pretty much sums up a lot about Korea and Koreans.  (Look at how relaxed that couple is, now that they stopped thinking and started feeling.) Of course they have a high regard for education and math and logic and such, but deep down I think many Koreans really like to work on emotion more than anything else.  Westerners seem to sublimate this moreso, or at least display it in a different way.  Maybe scratch all that...Westerners and Koreans are probably pretty similar, but the context in which we do it is different.  Anyways, if you think you're losing it in Korea just repeat to yourself 'Stop thinking, feel it. Stop thinking, feel it. Stop thinking, feel it.' and everything will be alright.
If anything, Korea is a country of extremes.  Everything here seems fad-based.  I think it may come from Korea's history.  It has been invaded a reported 700 times over the years, and each time they got independence I imagine they had to move quickly to get to the next level before the next war or occupation.  Lately (well, not really lately...in 1945) the Japanese Occupation ended.  Then the Korean War occurred from 1950-3.  After that there was turmoil, but in 1961 Park Chung Hee took over as dictator/president.  He had elections, in which everyone was 'encouraged' to vote, but he was still a dictator.  After his assassination in 1979 the next few leaders were basically of the same ilk.  President Park did some amazing things in his time, however.  He took an incredibly backward country and set it on the road to industrialization. Japan had stripped Korea of its resources, people and even its language and culture (many buildings and palaces were razed and Japanese was the official language here from 1910-1945) but President Park was determined to change that.  He orchestrated the 'Han River Miracle' (the Han River, or Hangang íê° is the main river in Seoul/Korea) and Korea made terrific strides, if at the expense of some civil liberties.  Fastforward to the present, and my point, and we see that Korea is the world's #1 wired nation.  More than Canada, Finland and way beyond the U.S.A.  There was a craze to have PCë°©s (PC bangs or rooms) EVERYWHERE in the country.  As well, instead of PlayStation-like games where players go against the computer or one or two people, Korean gamers (always the communal types) play online games with hundreds or thousands of others. in typical Korean fashion, gamers who left their seat for a second could not pause their game...in fact, they may be eliminated.  So PCbang owners sold drinks, ramen nooodles and other junk to their clientele.  It was just a matter of time before someone died, as related in  urlLink this article .  Yes, someone died from being on the PC.  People thought he was just sleeping (imagine how long he was there before they really checked him out) but, alas, he was the first known casulty of the Net in Korea, maybe the world.  Korea, built on extremes, both good and bad.
Take a read of this news article from urlLink JoongAng Ilbo  about North Korea's opinion on the scaling down of troops in Seoul and Korea (specifically, 3,600 troops are heading to Iraq and by the end of 2005 the current total of 37,000 should drop to about 24,500).   North blasts U.S. troop cuts  North Korea again blasted the United States yesterday for what it calls 'an increase of U.S. defense capabilities' after the planned relocation of 3,600 U.S. troops in South Korea to Iraq. Pyeongyang's state-run television network said the plans were preparations for a second Korean war.  'Even though part of the U.S. ground forces will be transferred to Iraq, instead of causing a capability vacuum, U.S. President Bush is augmenting his war policy against the North,' the broadcast complained.  'The U.S. security commitment [to South Korea] is a commitment for preemptive war against us,' the current affairs commentary said.     Ok, let me get this straight...moving troops OUT of South Korea and, further, OUT of the area closest to North Korea (the DMZ, or DeMilitarized Zone) is somehow INCREASING the U.S. defense capabilities in South Korea???  Well, I've read a lot of North Korean propaganda (such as at  urlLink DPRK.com , check out the DPRK News section) but this one is pretty unreal.  And with that I'd like to remind everyone that those in the DPRK (I should tell you that means Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or North Korea) are probably very good people, it's just the leadership that seems to be making all the waves (I could be wrong, but I'm not going to go up there and find out).  The Korean War from 1950-3 was a brutal event that severed many families...some of whom are now lucky enough to see their aged relatives again (remember, it's been 50+ years) in special reunion projects (albeit only for a few hours before everyone is whisked off to their respective countries).  Many, however have or will pass on without ever seeing a sister, brother, child, parent or boy/girlfriend again.  We in the West, especially Canada where we've never had a war on our own soil except the War of 1812, could never fully comprehend such things.  It really makes your wonder how far one would go to support ideology...I guess we have an idea now.
I surf the English news sites a lot looking for tidbits on Korea and how foreigners (like me) view the 'Hermit Kingdom' but also as a way to keep up with this fast-moving place.  Sometimes, though, one needs to check the veracity of the figures put in the papers...especially the local ones.  Here are two examples of how the English version of the Korea Times and that of the JoongAng Ilbo (Daily).  The first is pretty straightforward.   urlLink Korea Times  said that 249 people were arrested for forging Korean passports, but  urlLink JoongAng Ilbo  says just 114 were accused.  Huh?  Another one:  urlLink JoongAng Ilbo  said that S&P is positive on Korean banks (a good thing), while the  urlLink Korea Times  said that S&P was a tad worried about the bad loans that banks extended to small and medium-sized firms.  I have no idea why the simple facts seem to be presented so differently...it can't simply be translation, can it?
Ah, the Korean language...it looks so difficult at first, then as you figure out how to read Hanguel (Korea's surprisingly easy-to-learn alphabet of 24 characters) it seems so easy. Then the vocabulary starts. Oh no. Then the backwards (to us) sentence structure.  Yikes!  Luckily there are many options for us slow-witted foreigners to take on the language.  Of course I could list them here but  urlLink this JoongAng article  says a lot and there are more resources  urlLink here .    Well, if you're a guy here is some motivation for you: Jeon Ji Hyun (ì ì§í), the latest 20-something (24, actually) star of movies and CFs (I hear this means Commercial Feature, but not positive).  I saw her latest movie on Sunday night.  It's hard to describe the name...the English version is 'Windstruck' but the Korean version is ì¬ì¹ì (yeochinso) which is short for ë´ì¬ìì¹êµ¬ë¥¼ìê°í©ëë¤ (ne yeojachingu rul sogayhamnida) or 'I'd like to introduce you to my girlfriend'.  Surprisingly, both titles make sense.  If you like, there is a website (Korean and English, looks quite good, actually)  urlLink here .  The movie is shown in theatres with subtitles at special times, that info is  urlLink here . For a list of many of the theatres in Seoul click....  urlLink here!    urlLink    Here is a great reason to learn Korean...if I wasn't already married, that is.  I went with a few foreigners as well as a local/Korean/National...of course the Korean HAD to take a picture...so I HAVE to put it up here.   urlLink    Here we are after the movie...and before the hof/bar.     Update:  A bud of mine passed  urlLink this link  on to me. It's ì ì§í in a Giordano ad. Apparently it was NOT aired in Korea (nothing XXX about it, it's all about sensibilities of some sort).
If you click on my profile you'll make a not-so-startling discovery...I was born in Year of the Pig, as they say in the Korean/Chinese calendar.  But blogger.com figured it would be more appropriate to call it Year of the Boar/bore...thanks guys.  Anyways, you may be wondering how a fat, lazy, smelly Canadian guy born in a little town waaaaaay up north finds himself in a place like Seoul...and Yeouido, no less, where only a handful of foreigners visit, let alone live and work.  The culprit is my wife.  She is Korean, as you may know, and when I was doing financial consulting in Canada we came across an interesting client.  He found us through his wife's (see a pattern here?  Korean women rule the men) reading my column in the Vancouver Chosun (Chosun is the name of the last dynasty to rule Korea--it was ended by the 1910-1945 Japanese occupation) which you'll find  urlLink here . It's all in Korean, my email and webpage have changed, though.  Anyways, this client is a big guy here in Seoul as well as in Canada and wanted (for some reason) to do something for us...so the next time he went to Seoul we went as well (with our first son, second one wasn't around yet).  When we arrived in Seoul for our 2-3 week visit we met his 'godfathers' as he called them.  He wasn't mixed up in anything, he just liked the sound of being untouchable.  From there we met another guy then another guy and then, the next day, my current CEO.  We had what economists call a 'coincidence of wants'.  He wanted a foreigner with training and experience in securities and alternative assets and I wanted a guy with the connections to get things done in Seoul.  After a week or so of meeting for dinner and such (his English was pretty good and is better now, but my wife did a lot of translation in the first part) he said: 'Don't go back to Canada, stay here and work with me.'  Not work for me...with me.  That was interesting.  I knew he had a more enlightened view than most Korean bosses right then and there.  So here I am.  It's not perfect, I can't speak a lot of the language and sometimes I almost go nuts here what with the differences in culture and business, but it's not bad at all.  I also go home every 2 months or so (my wife had baby #2 in Canada and is still there for a bit longer) which means lots of time in airplanes.  I always fly  urlLink Singapore Air  but even then, the prospect of being in the air for 100 hours a year is not all that appealing (ya, that's over 4 DAYS flying, over 1% of the year).  I do, however, watch about 20-25 movies a year on the plane, which is cool because Singapore Air has individual monitors with on-demand TV and movies for ALL passengers.
Last night was pretty fun...mostly because of the company I kept.  I recently met a couple of finance-types here in Yeouido (which isn't too hard to do, as it's referred to as Korea's Wall Street) who spoke pretty good English (which is a rarity here not only in Yeouido but everywhere in Korea).  They had studied outside Korea and deal with international business...but still my brutal Canadian accent made it pretty tough for them to figure out what I was saying sometimes.  There was one time that their accent got in the way, though.  When we went to the restaurant the guy (Junseok, the gal is named Hye-Kyung) asked: 'Do you like deok?'  I wrote it just as I heard it.  I thought he meant dog (they eat that here) so I called his bluff and said, 'Sure, let's go! What kind of dog?' 'Oh no, deok, deok!' 'Ya, dog?' 'No, deok,' he said again. Then I figured out that he meant 'duck' and said, 'Oh, &#50724;&#47532; (oh-ri), duck! Not &#44060; (gay), dog! Why didn't you just speak Korean?  I know &#50724;&#47532; and &#44060;!'  The food was great, then we went to the obligatory ì´ì°¨ (ee-cha, thanks Hye-Kyung for the correction) or second round.  Koreans can never just go to one place to eat and drink.  Usually we will wander the streets and go out to three, four or five places. A couple of weeks ago in Hongdae (university bar district here) we went to 4 places: the &#49328;&#45209;&#51648; (san-nak-ji, living octopus) restaurant, Old Rock (cool bar), a &#45432;&#47000;&#48169; (noraebang, Korean word for karaoke) and finally clubnb (or noise basement) until the wee hours of the morning.  (Personally I prefer the Kangnam version of clubnb, but since we were in Hongdae we went to that one.)  The coolest thing here about bar-hopping/pub-crawling is there is almost never a lineup and very rarely a cover (just in the clubs, never in bars).  I think this is because people are always moving.  In Canada if you get in a bar you never, never leave until you go home...which means those who want to get in have to lineup.  Also, if a Korean is asked to wait (for anything, especially after a few drinks) they will just balk and leave...and no bar-owner would like that.  Maybe that's why Koreans in general are moving around more and Canadians are so sedate (relatively...if you've lived in both places you know what I mean).   Update:  looks like everyone wants to be on my blog...for some reason.  Here are the pics of my gracious hosts of the evening.   urlLink    Junseok, who works in International Business and has an MBA...he's trying to come up with a fitting Western name for himself, if you have one to suggest just leave a comment, please.   urlLink    Hae-Kyung, who works with him.  She too has an MBA (and from my wife's alma mater of Ewha Women's University, no less).  Hae-Kyung is really good at English and is quite bright...and single (men, take note). She thinks her face looks like the moon, or ë¬ë©ì´ (Daldeong-ee) as they say here, I guess so...
There is so much that is different here from anything I've ever seen (well, I haven't travelled that much, just in Canada, the US, Philippines and Japan).  And I mean totally different.  Maybe it's because I've been here long enough to see a lot, I dunno.  Anyways, if you'd like more on this place take a look at my  urlLink Virtual Tourist pages .
urlLink    Here it is, the superfantastic phonebox!  Today is a great day.  Our lovely officegirl Jung Mi (please no letters, that's what secretaries are called here) went to LG Twins building and got me a new phone.  I really needed one on account of (i) my old one was all in Korean...which was fine because I memorized where to go to do things on it...and (ii) the screen kept going blank because I produce copious amounts of sweat when I inline skate and was dumb enough to be on the phone at the same time.  Well, after 4 screens at 60,000 won a pop I decided it's time to get a new one...but I may end up breaking this one too.  It's soooooo cooooool.  It has a little camera which I used to take a picture of the box (of course it took me a while to figure out that I couldn't use it to take a pic of the actual phone).  I also took a pic of our lovely officegirl...and then inputted her name and number as well...then ordered up caller ID (something I didn't have before, much to my chagrin).  Then I asked her to call me to test it out.  Her mug showed up on the little screen on the outside of the phone (how cool is that?!?!) and she immediately started panicking and saying, 'Change! Change!'  haha, Some Korean girls really hate to have pictures taken of them.  She did, however, insist that I put the pic on this posting...go figure.  This phone really rocks.  I can take pictures, email them or send to other phones, and send and receive normal emails too. Also, it has a language converter so everything is finally in English.  It's tiny, too...like the size of a fat businesscard.   urlLink    Here she is doing the Korean sign for 'take my picture'.   urlLink    Here is a coworker of mine with the same pose.  Why? Why?
One thing I love about Seoul (and I mean this about Korea in general...I just happen to be a little Seoul-centric) is the street sellers.  I don't really trust the food they sell on the side of the road (except ice cream) but virtually everything else is fair game for me.  For example, to get ready for my trip to Canada and generally stock up, in the last two weeks I bought:  2 plants in a can for my nieces (8,000 won) 2 lightweight sports shirts for inlining (10,000 won for both) 1 pair of shorts for inlining (20,000 won) 3 bags of dried ê³ êµ¬ë§ (goguma, sweet potatoes or yams, they were selling 1 for 3,000 won , 2 for 5,000 but I got 3 for 6,000) 1 tie (at an amazing price of 5,000 won, or USD 4...and I can't really tell how it's worse than the ones I bought for USD 100 back home.) 10 disposible razors (for 1,000 won, or USD 0.80 FOR ALL TEN) 1 noise-making toy hammer for boy #2 (1,000 won) 3 Disney photo albums (but I'm sure ol' Walt didn't make a penny on these....just 1,000 won each)  The clothes-seller guy spoke pretty good English...I know because he held my hostage for 5 minutes as we talked about how Korean men are getting fatter (hence his stock of larger sizes for husky guys like me) and how he learned English working for the US Army about 20-30 years ago.  The goguma-guy didn't know a lot of English, but he did speak Spanish owing to the fact that he lived in Argentina for a few years.  Unfortunately, Spanish is not one of my languages...I know a fair bit of French from my school-days, a smattering Japanese and, of course, some Korean. Anyways, when I passed the goguma-guy later in the week I gave him a big 'hola!' (Spanish for hello, and the extent of my proficiency) and he returned one as well...wow, bridging the cultures with another one...how UN of me.  Below is a picture of the famous Yeouido tie-truck.  This guy stops in the hotspots and unloads silk and polyester ties on neckwear-hungry salarymen.   urlLink    Here they are: 2 for 5,000 won (USD 4.50)!
urlLink    Wonderful oh-gyup-sal at my favorite pork restaurant.  It's official, pork has now outstripped beef as the top meat import to Korea.  (See  urlLink JoongAng Ilbo link ) and no wonder...what with Mad Cow Disease and Avian Flu virus going around.  The only thing that seems 'safe' is pork.  Of course, as you may know, oh-gyup-sal literally means 5 layers of fat...so maybe it's not super healthy.  Well, I wasn't that bad, I did do 2 hours of inline skating (as they call it here...rollerblading seems to have a tough time rolling off the Korean tongue) beforehand...but the ì¤ê²¹ì´ was drowned by a lovely concoction called ì¤ì­ì¸ì£¼ (oh-ship-say-joo) which is a 50/50 mix of ë°±ì¸ì£¼ (baek-say-ju, literally: hundred year alcohol) and ìì£¼ (soju, literally: booze) thus the translation of the combined drink is called 50 year alcohol.  Intersting, eh?
Here is the latest from the Korean rumor mill (it made it all the way to Coquitlam, and my wife's ears).  It seems The Grand Hyatt Hotel's (in Itaewon)  urlLink J.J. Mahoney's  has a reputation for beautiful Korean ladies using it as a place to pick up foreign (likely white) men...even married ones.  So, if you're single and looking for a good time check out J.J.'s (just bring a lot of dough, the prices are about two times that of most other Western bars).  If you're married...well, that's up to you (you should know that some of the gals on the prowl there are 'ladies for sale' there was well, and the prices are reportedly quite high).  If your man is in Seoul and reading this (or otherwise knows the score) better get a polygraph...from what I saw some of those gals are pretty good looking (not that I was looking, of course).  Well, that's it for tonight.  I gotta take the boy to school tomorrow at like 9AM (which is early for my vacation-time now).
Well, I stand corrected, again.  Yesterday I blogged that Coquitlam was an oasis of Whiteness in the sea of Asians that is Vancouver, but oh how I was wrong.  We went to the, aptly named, Coquitlam Mall today and put Spencer in the play area with a few other kids.  I heard a lady speaking Korean to her boy, then a flock (well, three) ajumas (older Korean ladies) came and sat near us.  Later, when we went to the pool, we saw that the neighbors right next to us and across the street are Koreans too.  Then on the way back I learned that another two sets of neighbors are Korean as well.  They're everywhere!  It's actually pretty cool.  One thing about Koreans is they have a pretty good sense of community.  Get a group of white people (who aren't farmers) together and we seem to be pretty stand-offish...or at least it takes a while to warm up.  Koreans, as you may know,  urlLink refer to each other as sister or brother  as soon as 3 minutes of meeting one another (as I have seen).  This is, I think, quite extraordinary.  From first meetings with my son my wife called the girls in the area 'nuna' or 'older sister, as said by a  younger brother' (they have a special word for every family member).  Also, since Koreans don't normally take to English all that well (or quickly) they really, really appreciate speaking with someone from home.  Thus, the community here is quite tight.  So I've still got jetlag...although it's pretty nice not to have to work through it.  The boys tend to keep me moving all day, though.  Usually I sleep at 3AM or 4AM then get up at 11AM, but it's not a good  urlLink REM  sleep.  My best sleep seems to be 1-2 hour naps at 3PM or 7PM.  When I wake up from those it's really like getting up in the morning; and getting up in the morning is like waking up at midnight.  My father-in-law thinks I should just adjust 100% in like 2 days, but I'm not sure if I'm built that way.  If I need to I can do it, but it's like I'm on vacation here.  Besides, I do my work at night anyways, when the kids are asleep (and Seoul is awake).  I guess that's it for now.  Nothing more profound than this from the day, which is a little sad.  I love it here: so clean, peaceful and easy to live; but I kinda miss Seoul too: so dirty, loud and easy to get run down by  urlLink deliveryboys on motorcycles .
So I've been in Vancouver a few days now...in Coquitlam, actually.  It's really an interesting place; I used to think it was full of Chinese people (not that there's anything wrong with that, but Vancouver's #1 mother tongue is Mandarin/Cantonese, so you'd assume there'd be tons here).  Our area is up on a hill in a little bit of paradise, actually.  It has started to remind me of Newport in that show  urlLink The O.C.  (O.C. means Orange County).  Well, it isn't full of million dollar homes (but there are a few) but the topography is similar (hills, lots of parks, but no beach) and it's really, really white here.  I think the only Koreans I've seen have been family and Ensign Harry Kim on Star Trek: Voyager (ya, still have jetlag...watching anything that hits the screen here).  On that note, I think I'm having T.V. overload.  Well, with the kids I don't get to see too much of it, but when I do I'm boggled by the 60+ stations (and that's not even satellite!) and all, save one, of them are in ENGLISH!  Wow!  In Seoul I didn't even bother with cable so all I had was  urlLink AFN  (American Forces Network) (that guy on the homepage is their 6:30 newsanchor...the very reason I like to inline/rollerblade from 6-8PM).  Even if you have cable you only get like 2-3 other 'B' movie stations...nothing to write home about.  Truth be told, though, AFN has a pretty good lineup and I get to learn all about opsec (operational security) and that the U.S. Army in Korea is looking for E-4s and E-5s (enlisted ranks) to be MPs (Military Police).  So if you can handle the G.I. ads AFN is pretty cool.  Anyways, I didn't remember so many ads for weight-loss programs, get-rich-quick schemes and fantastic kitchen products, but there they were.  Of course in Korea most people are pretty fit and they know the best way to get rich is to marry rich or work hard--there are some ads there for kitchen and cleaning product, though, proving that some things truly are universal.  One ad that did throw me, though, was one for a 'male enhancement' pill.  What?!?!?  You take a pill for a bigger willi?  One version even had about 30 allusions to 'wood' throughout it.  I thought it was a spoof...maybe it was...it was on CNBC during  urlLink The Dennis Miller Show .   If anyone knows, please comment.  Ok, back to my time here.  We went down to the clubhouse to have a dip (ya, it's a little swanky...but the pool is outside, so it's not super-swanky) and there were some 18-something gals there sunning themselves and gabbing.  Man, this is NOT Seoul.  For one thing, no one actually tries to get a tan in Korea.  They wear Darth Vader-inspired visors to keep out all the rays they can and everyone is totally covered up.  Even when exercising Korean have pants, long-sleeves,  even suits .  Also, two of the three of them were 'plus size'.  They weighed like 2-3 TIMES that of a typical Korean gal.  (Not that that's a bad thing...it's just differences...please, no flames.)  Then you have to think...if they are 18 aren't they still in school?  By that I mean, they have not graduated from college.  An 18-year old Korean would be in the library or at a DVD bang, at least.  Most likely not at a pool (and I hear they're there everyday for hours on end)...what a different lifestyle.  Even after school is finished they'd be working or looking for a husband, or both.  Let's face it, many Koreans have little time to be idle (I must say, they do take time to drink and go to the sauna, though).  Maybe I'm becoming too Korean now, beating up these gals simply for having a little fun.  All I know is if they did that in Korea people might think they are  urlLink R.S.  (room salon, or places where men pay women to drink with them, sing with them and...uh...do other things) girls.  Maybe that's part of the Korean ideal.  Women should study and work and find a husband and if they are 'wasting' their time everyday then they must be of low moral fiber.  Hmmmm...there could be something to that.  Maybe it's part of the reason why so many Korean gals work their butts off (literally, Korean women are usually devoid of a derriere) and seem to push off their own pleasure in some Calvinist tradition.  Korean men seem to support this as it not only support the Confucius ideals that many Koreans follow but makes their place as symbolic leader of the home that much more solid (whether it is deserved or not, and we know that in many Korean homes a strong wife controls more than she advertises).
Whenever I see a pregnant Korean lady I really feel for her, because I know that within a few months she will have a 3-5 year sentence to complete and utter child-rearing duties.  As with most things Korean, mothers go all out...right from before conception to...well, it never stops.    Today I got a taste of that.  What a day!  My 3-year old (Spencer) woke me up at 9AM (which is early seeing as I still have some jetlag and was up from midnight to 3AM last night).  The younger, Winston, was already up, too.  My wife and I must have fed these kids like 5-7 times during the day, they just never stop!  Spencer and I went to his swimming class.  We get a discount on regular swimming since he's enrolled.  The gal behind the counter asked if he was swimming outside of the class as well...I really had no idea what was happening and said, 'I'm not sure.'  She said, in no uncertain terms, that it meant a lot to her whether he was or not.  I just said, ok, he is, how much?  Let's see $1.30 plus $2.60...$3.90.  You've got to be kidding?! You're bent about chun-on? (1,000 won/$1.15)?  This would not happen in Seoul.  They'd see Spencer and pay HIM to come into there!  Anyways, what I did with him in the pool was pretty much what the 'instructor' did as well...but she had 3 kids to handle.  I thought he'd be doing lengths or strokes, but I guess not yet.  After swimming I got my wife a Starbucks coffee.  She loves the stuff, and apparently can't justify to herself to buy herself one...those selfless Korean women, bless their hearts.  After I came home there was shopping to do.  I volunteered to go (kudos for me and time to think), then I suggested Spencer come too (thought he'd fall asleep in the car, especially after swimming) then thought we might as well all go (the list she gave me was going to take a couple of people to complete).  Well, the kids stayed up the whole time and I started to realize that this parenting thing is a lot harder when the kids are actually in the country with you (I'm usually in Seoul) and it's just you two (her mother and sister were out of town).  Good God, these kids didn't sleep until 11PM!  Someday they'll make great investment bankers, I mused.  To all those out there who are single parents, or even just parents, get yourself a Starbucks...you may not be able to drink it before it gets cold, but at least you have a piece of luxury in your hand for a few seconds.
My wife posed a strange question to me tonight.  Apparently this is the new fad in Korea...men are asked 'if your wife and your mother are drowning (neither can swim) and you have time to save just one of them who would you choose?'.  Many men say, 'my mother, because I can always remarry...but I can never replace my mom.'  Ok, true enough, but usually its the wives who ask this and one fellow I know said, in front of a throng of relatives (including his wife) that he'd save his mom.  The wife was not impressed.  Let's look at this on a more cultural level for a moment.  Much of Korean tradition is based on Confucius' teachings; where younger take care of elder, women take care of men and duty to family is first.  Parents sacrifice a lot for their kids to get them the best education, lifestyle and necessities; children, in turn, are expected to do the same when they have the means.  Thus, a man should choose to save his mother, who did everything for him (and perhaps still does) rather than his wife who is a bit of a late-comer.  The reason for all of this ultimatum questioning comes from family conflict.  A husband's mother often endures a lot from her husband, children, society and her own mother-in-law and, not one to stop the cycle, she will often unleash her frustration on the unsuspecting wife.  She comes to pry into, advise upon and attempt to control many parts of the couple's lives under the guise of helping her dear son.  With divorce becoming more accepted and this has broken up more than a few marriages lately; and now people are getting a little pre-emptive, perhaps, in asking the husband to make a choice in order to ascertain his convictions.  So, men, if you get this question posed to you first think of who is asking it (probably your wife) take a look around the room to find out who is listening and then give the best answer you can.  Just remember, you likely sleep with your wife every night, not your mother.
As readers will know, my favorite airline is Singapore Air (SAI).  They have those personal monitors for everyone with on-demand movies, TV shows and games..and some lovely-looking stewardesses, of course.  Another thing going for them is their empathy with their passengers.  I've twice been bumped up to business class (with it's better meals and basically flat sleeper beds...what an experience that is).  Once because the travel agent made a mistake and SAI decided they'd make my life a bit easier (hint: if you take the same flight 5-10 times they get to know you, too) and another time my flight was overbooked so I too business to San Francisco and got another one to Vancouver (both covered by SAI) as well as 500 Sing$ (300 USD, 350,000 won) which made for a 40% discount from my ticket price.  Anyways, this time I was in line for about 30 minutes (maybe it was longer) and a few times I squatted to relieve my legs a bit.  The gal at the counter apologized and put 2 'Solitaire' tags on my bags (will upload pic when I get back to Seoul so you can put your color printer to good use and make a few of your own) that basically put them on par with business class for unloading.  Nice.  The meals on the flight were good, there were lots of good movies and, as usual, they gave me one of those sleeper masks when I asked for it (in business it's automatic, but if you ask in economy you'll get one).  Upon arrival in Vancouver I saw a rare sight, the customs area was packed!  A cruise was in port and normal flights all bunched up to.  Not to worry, though, as just as I approached the line they opened another area of inspectors...and in about 10 minutes I was picking up my bags.  To top it off my cabbie spoke English (something that eluded me in Seoul and Vancouver much of the time) and we had a pretty cool conversation about life, marriage and cultures.  (He too believes that once you stop looking for a spouse you'll meet them...a little wisdom for you single-but-lookings out there.)  My phone can take pictures here but needs a special chip to connect.  I forgot its charger and extra battery, and already ran down the old one...so that's the only blotch on this trip so far; which ain't too bad.  I've decided to start to teach him my limited French...which should keep him on his toes.  He's already got some of the accent down when he speaks baby-talk.
When I was in Seoul these last few months I thought my wife had it kinda easy here with 'just' our 2 kids to take care of.  Now I know that this parenting thing is pretty tough.  The worst thing is they 'tag team' us.  For example, one stays up til 3:30AM, the other wakes up at 7AM.  One has a nap, and the other gets hungry.  And my wife isn't into lots of crap food for them, too...so she is constantly cooking and preparing wonderful delicacies like 'rice brocolli cheese tofu cakes' and 'seaweed and beef soup'--sounds great, eh?!  Well, the kids like it and I guess it's good for them.  When I go back to Seoul I know I'll miss these days (and nights) and start my old routine of 6PM rollerblading and going out to the bars on the weekends (maybe even during the week a bit, as my  urlLink CFA  test is finished for a few months).  I know the days will be a little less full without my 3-year old jumping (from the couch) onto my stomache/back/gonads...ah, how can I survive?  We will have the webcam and daily phonecalls to make things a bit easier, but it won't be the same.  Ug, so tired now...it's past 11PM and I know tomorrow will be busy...and the next day too.  My bud of almost 25 years is coming to visit and I'll make the trip to the ferry terminal to pick him up and the new place is now inconveniently 60 minutes from the docks compared to 30 minutes for our old place.  No matter, I imagine I'll relish the time alone on a simple car trip.
You may have noticed a new feature on my blog...it's a blog email notification thingy ( urlLink Blogarithm ).  All you need to do is put your email in the space and 'Keep it Fresh' and you'll get an email every time I update this blog.  I use this on blogs that I normally read (once I get better at code I'll actually have them posted on this page too) and find it pretty handy.  The last few days have been pretty hectic.  Basically in the pool (our complex's or the public one) everyday and running around with the kids and not getting a lot of sleep.  My wife and I take turns (one was up til 3AM last night, the other awoke at 7AM)...man, getting back to Seoul and my bachelor pad will be like a vacation--no matter how much work I have at the office.  There they go again...gotta go.
Korea, especially Seoul, is pretty cool; and Canada, especially Vancouver is pretty cool too.  Here are a few things I will (and will not) miss:  Things to miss about Korea: being a celebrity (well, a little one, at least...just for being me); 100 kinds of ice cream at the local convenience store (and all for 500 won/USD 0.40); 7 24-hour convenience stores within a block or two of my place;  urlLink inlining/rollerblading along the Han River ; bars with no line-ups; bar-hopping to at least 2-4 places in a night; Korean people; not worrying about water on the floor of my  urlLink fully tiled bathroom ; super-efficient  urlLink subways ; super-cheap  urlLink cabs  where the subways leave off;  urlLink no taxes ,  urlLink no tipping ; great food, and seconds for free;  urlLink alcohol  available at any store; eating  urlLink live octopus  (I mean live as in swimming around in a bowl/on a plate on the table); getting free fruit and/or tea and/or coffee and/or sugary drinks after every meal.  Things to miss about Canada:  urlLink no pollution  (or not noticeable, at least); good mixed drinks (like Dr. Pepper and Long Island iced teas, although that's changing in Seoul now); our complex's pool just 5 minutes away (and it's usually just us or a few people there);  urlLink burgers that are not served raw   (hellloooooo! heard of e-coli?).  Things not to miss about Seoul: drunk guys pissing in the streets at night (well, I am one of them sometimes); people always thinking I'm crazy for not liking tofu; paying like $10 for enough ground beef for 2 hamburgers; having to go to the foreign food section to get my M&Ms.  Things not to miss about Canada: line-ups and cover charge at almost every good bar; larger Canadian chicks (hey, no flamings, please); union leaders who think someone should make $20 an hour to pick up trash when Korean 60-year-old men do it in Seoul for like $100 a month; Vancouver rain in the winter...and spring...and fall...and summer; high (14.5%!) sales  urlLink tax ; tips treated as if they are expected (no matter the service); having to go to the foreign food section to get my ramen noodles.
It seems everything is not all that smooth in Seoul concerning the recent changes.  This makes sense because, as Koreans would, they decided not only to change the payment system but also all of the bus color-schemes, routes numbers and routes and even the structure of the roads in some areas of the city (see pic below of a fast lane for buses in one of the worst traffic areas of the city).  More in  urlLink this Korea Times article .   urlLink    Life in the fast lane.
This may be a long blog...got a lot of thoughts going through my head this last couple of days, not least because of my reading  urlLink A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market --a very cool book and one that I wish I read before embarking on the  urlLink CFA  designation exams (wrote 2 of the 3 required exams already).  Anyhoo, went out for some drinks last night (yes, Thursday night, a school night, but I really wanted to break this jetlag and I find that going out is one of the most effective, and most fun, ways to do so) at a little place called Han's Sausages near Hong-Ik University (usually referred to as HongDae).  So upon ordering the bratwurst and beer I noticed something interesting, the beer came in a special pitcher that has dry ice in a compartment in the bottom of it and passages that allow the vapor to flow to the top and escape.  Pretty cool idea, and I had seen it before in another bar in Sinchon (another teen/bar district near HongDae).  While out on the town I started to think, 'What are the odds that I know someone here in this bar or meet them on the street?'  Likely pretty low, but then I remembered the last night I came here and got a call from an old co-worker who was basically 2 blocks from me and had just had &#49328;&#45209;&#51648; (san-nak-ji, living octopus) in a little place that we almost went to (now that was interesting).  Then I remembered that a friend of mine's former girlfriend is in Korea--not Seoul, in Pusan. But her sister-in-law's friend is engaged to a Korean girl in Daegu who often comes to Seoul (HongDae/Sinchon specifically) to see friends.  So, what if one of the thousands of people I saw were one of those friends?  How many  urlLink degrees of separation   is that?  Two to the Pusan friend (or one, if you count that I know her now), plus three to the groom-to-be (or two as the Pusan friend already knows her sister-in-law) and two more to the friend(s) in Seoul.  So that's 4 to 7 degrees, not bad.  I could also suppose that the people on the street know my wife or one of her friends (as she went to school there) but we are older than these kids and it's not quite as interesting a story as going to Vancouver then Daegu then back to Seoul.  Another area: yesterday I met some guys from an asset management firm here (for business).  One spoke quite good English, and when he found out I was from Vancouver he noted that his brother-in-law is living here.  As well, the owner of the  urlLink &#49340;&#44228;&#53461;  (samgyetang, ginseng chicken soup) place across from my apartment has a home in a suburb of Vancouver. What are the odds of that?  Now let's deconstruct this a bit, and take a bit from my current reading (and suspend for a bit the idea that I have incredible selective memory and am merely drawing connections from random events).  On the beer: both restaurants were in the same relative are (more or less) and it makes sense that a seller of those dry-ice pitchers would service both of them.  For the people on the street: the university district is full of school kids, school kids are not (usually, especially in Korea) destitute poor and they are (by definition) educated (or nearso) and it is the well-to-do and educated that end up going to foreign countries and meet/marry foreigners (there are exceptions, just humor me for a bit).  Thus, it makes some sense that I (who knows many educated people in Korea and Canada, as I am one myself) would have an ok chance to have some connection with similar people in another country, no matter the whereabouts.  (This reminds me of when I spent a month in the Philippines with my bud Carlo who met a friend there who ended up being his distant relative. Especially in places where the economic/social strata is well-defined the 'top 1%' seem to flock together.)  Concerning the people who have ties in Vancouver.  Proximity is one factor, and wealth is another.  Vancouver is the closest airport to Seoul (one hour longer to go to San Francisco) and it also has an inviting climate and seems to attract the wealthy from many countries (including the U.S.).  So it makes sense that these, again, well-to-do and educated people would have some connection to my other home.  What's my point and how does it lead to a better understanding of Korean culture?  It's this: When you meet a Korean (or when they are  urlLink on their first dates ) they will always ask questions to  urlLink figure out if they have some connection  such as  urlLink age  and ethnicity or school ties or anysuch thing that could prove a connection.  For foreigners this kind of questioning is sometimes seen as rude, but this is just a part of Korea: you get used to it.  This is one reason that Koreans study their butts off to go to the best/largest schools such as  urlLink Seoul National University ,  urlLink Korea University ,  urlLink Ewha Women's University  and  urlLink Yonsei University  and then put themselves through incredible stress to get into major companies such as  urlLink Samsung Group .  It's because after all that study and hard work one will have instant camaraderie with fellow alumni and, thus, be able to move to Vancouver when they retire and not have to work selling dry-ice beer pitchers to every bar in Korea.
I've always thought of Seoul's  urlLink subways  as a real joy to be on. They are clean, fast, efficient(more or less) and CHEAP.  Buses, on the other hand, are a bit of a mystery to me.  I take one bus regularly, but that's it.   urlLink taxis , however, are plentiful, cheap and (once you know a little Korean) pretty easy to use.  Now things are getting a lot easier and logical.  As of today (July 1st) rates will be based on distance traveled rather than number of rides.  This makes sense as it always irked me when you had to pay again to transfer from one bus to another or from the bus to subway (this doesn't happen in Vancouver).  The new system just has you pay for the length of each little trip.  As well, my phone will be able to house my T-Money so I don't need to carry change or fish around for my wallet or 'stored-value' ticket.  (It can even be used in convenience stores and cabs soon! And carry up to 500,000 won, or about 435USD)There's also a color-coding scheme to the buses which may or may not make things easier.  Unless they have little maps on the buses I think most foreigners will find the new system about a confusing as the old, but a lot of that has to do with the language and familiarity with a city/district that covers many, many square kms.  Check out articles on all this stuff  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .
Big cities are famous for being expensive places to live, some more than others, of course.  Here is the latest (2004,  urlLink source ) list of priciest cities to live in (sorry not sure how to format a table):                             1  Tokyo, Japan                         2  London, UK                           3  Moscow, Russia    4  Osaka, Japan    5  Hong Kong    6  Geneva, Switzerland      7  Seoul, South Korea      8  Copenhagen, Denmark    9  ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland   10  St. Petersburg, Russia   11  Beijing, China   12  New York City, USA   13  Milan, Italy   14  Dublin, Ireland   15  Oslo, Norway   16  Shanghai, China   17  Paris, France   18  Istanbul, Turkey   19  Vienna, Austria   20  Sydney, Australia   21  Rome, Italy   22  Stockholm, Sweden   23  Helsinki, Finland   24  Abidjan, Ivory Coast   25  Douala, Cameroon   26  Amsterdam, Netherlands   27  Los Angeles, USA   28  Berlin, Germany   29  Hanoi, Vietnam   30  Shenzhen, China   31  Taipei, Taiwan   32  Guangzhou, China   33  Tel Aviv, Israel   34  Budapest, Hungary   35  Chicago, USA   36  Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam   37  Beirut, Lebanon   38  San Francisco, USA   39  Luxembourg   40  DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany   41  Glasgow, UK   42  Frankfurt, Germany   43  Munich, Germany   44  Bratislava, Slovak Republic   45  Jakarta, Indonesia   46  Singapore   47  Dakar, Senegal   48  Riga, Latvia   49  Prague, Czech Republic   50  Athens, Greece   51  Birmingham, UK   52  White Plains, USA   53  Brussels, Belgium   54  Kiev, Ukraine   55  Miami, USA   56  Barcelona, Spain   57  Honolulu, USA   58  Hamburg, Germany   59  Zagreb, Croatia   60  Algiers, Algeria   61  Madrid, Spain   62  Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates   63  Amman, Jordan   64  Kuwait City, Kuwait   65  San Juan, Puerto Rico   66  Casablanca, Morocco   67  Melbourne, Australia   68  Washington, USA   69  Lyon, France   70  Boston, USA   71  Lisbon, Portugal   72  Morristown, USA   73  Houston, USA   74  Almaty, Kazakhstan  75  Tallinn, Estonia  76  Warsaw, Poland  77  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  78  Manama, Bahrain  79  Sofia, Bulgaria  80  Auckland, New Zealand  81  Jeddah, Saudi Arabia  82  Ljubljana, Slovenia  83  Dubai, United Arab Emirates  84  Mexico City, Mexico  85  Atlanta, USA  86  Wellington, New Zealand  87  Brisbane, Australia  88  Adelaide, Australia   89  Toronto, Canada   90  Seattle, USA  91  Vilnius, Lithuania  92  St. Louis, USA  93  Leipzig, Germany  94  Perth, Australia  95  Limassol, Cyprus    96  Vancouver, Canada    97  Accra, Ghana  98  Cleveland, USA  99  Cairo, Egypt  100  Denver, USA  101  Detroit, USA  102  Monterrey, Mexico  103  Kingston, Jamaica  104  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  105  Portland, USA  106  Panama City  107  Winston Salem, USA  108  Guatemala City, Guatemala  109  Mumbai, India  110  Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei  111  Lagos, Nigeria  112  Pittsburgh, USA  113  Montreal, Canada  114  Calgary, Canada  115  Tianjin, China  116  New Delhi, India  117  Dacca (Dhaka), Bangladesh  118  Lima, Peru  119  Bangkok, Thailand  120  Tunis, Tunisia  121  Nairobi, Kenya  122  Tehran, Iran  123  Santiago, Chile  124  Ottawa, Canada  125  Lusaka, Zambia  126  Johannesburg, South Africa  127  Colombo, Sri Lanka  128  SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil  129  Bucharest, Romania  130  San JosÃ©, Costa Rica  131  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  132  Karachi, Pakistan  133  Chennai (Madras), India  134  Caracas, Venezuela  135  Blantyre, Malawi  136  Quito, Ecuador  137  Bangalore, India  138  Manila, Philippines  139  BogotÃ¡, Colombia  140  Harare, Zimbabwe  141  Buenos Aires, Argentina  142  Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic  143  Montevideo, Uruguay  144  AsunciÃ³n, Paraguay   Whew, that was long...I have to learn more about cutting code so I can make this thing prettier.  Anyways, Seoul is #7 and the first Canadian city is the 'Big Smoke' (as my Dad calls it), Toronto at #89 then my recent/dual hometown of Vancouver at #96 (I suspect it'll rise next year as real estate is on a bit of a tear lately).  Thing is, if you have the residence/home thing taken care of (as most teachers do in Korea) then living in Seoul/Korea can be pretty cheap.  Of course you can always spend $4,500 USD for a bottle of  urlLink Macallan 50 year-old whisky  at  urlLink SkyBar , but if you keep your head on straight it's not too bad.  Every morning I go to my local 7-11 and have 2  urlLink ì¼ê°ê¹ë°¥  (sam-gak-gim-bab, literally 3-angled/triangle seaweed and rice) for about 1USD.  Today I splurged for a ìì°ë²ê±° (say-oo/shrimp burger) but the price was still under 2USD.  (It's good for dieting too, as my wife near-constantly reminds me, because rice has 1/3rd the fat of bread and likely 1/100th that of a croissant, muffin or bagel.)   urlLink    My lovely breakfast.  Shrimp burger and triangle kimbap.
Koreans have a great sense of community.  So much so that sometimes they figure they can have a nap any old place.  Now I understand taking a snooze in a subway car (they are safer here) or taxi (done that a few times), but on some steps?  Well, it happens.   urlLink    I couldn't resist taking a pic of this guy...it was like 6PM and he was already sacked out on the front steps of a building in Sinchon (teen district of Seoul).  Notice his jacket is a step or so down from his resting place.  Must be nice to be in a virtually crime-free city.
urlLink    The business class tag for baggage.  I have to keep this in pristine condition for future flights.
I used to cook for myself all the time (making bulggogi, kalbi and even lasagna).  Now, however, I'm getting pretty lazy.  Food is so good, plentiful and cheap in the restaurants (nevermind that Koeans love to go out to eat so if I did cook a large amount of food about half of it would go to waste anyways) that I've decided not to shop for anything more than noodles and booze.  (See photos for the result.)  Far from what I expected, I ended up losing weight and spending about the same amount of money, go figure.   urlLink    What a balanced diet I have...noodles and more noodles, tuna, gochoo jang (sauce).   urlLink    My fridge, the oranges are just for show, they've been in there for like 6 weeks.  Notice the contents: ketchup, mayo, orange juice (jeju-do) beer, soju, beaksayju, mayshilju, onions.
I often wondered where the restauranteurs heated up the briquettes or brinks or rocks that they placed in the table for traditional Korean cooking...then I saw this.  This place (not a good pic, it was from a taxi with my phone-camera) actually has a fire on the sidewalk right in front of it!  The guy is pickin out a red/white-hot brick for the patrons inside.  Only in Korea.   urlLink    Fire in the hole!
It feels like I didn't even leave this place, which is a little scary.  Things will be a little weird for a bit (as I take about a week to get over jetlag, unlike some people I know who take about 2 days) so postings may be a little sporatic for a bit.  As well, work is getting busier...which is fine my me.  It's kind of interesting, actually.  At this job we always have something to do (I do the weekly newsletter, research, presentations to clients, and liaise with our foreign partners) but there are definate lulls and busy times.  Just before my vacation was a lull, now we're back in the thick of things.  Speaking of thick, take a look at this pic.  Many days here are like this (although, admittedly, not this brutal).  Some are blue-skied, but even then you know that the pollution is there.  I left my windows upon when I went home and when I came back there was a thin layer of soot on the floor...hmmmm, that seems real nice, eh?  Now I know why my mother-in-law always cleaned the floor every day or so.  Apparently Seoul has DOUBLE the amount of particles (I'm assuming 'bad' particles) in its air.  Anyone who jogs here is nuts (but I, of course, do inline/rollerblade almost everyday, so I'm no better).   urlLink    Lovely Seoul smog.  One problem is the number of cars here, another is the level of industrialization and lack of environmental laws (or enforcement thereof) but there is also the polution that comes over from China (where things, from what I hear, are a lot worse) and the  urlLink Yellow Wind/Dust  that makes its way to our shores once or twice a year.  I was in one of these storms a few years ago (I was the only gomer without a surgical mask on) and I felt pretty weird afterward.  If you have a respiratory problem things could get ugly.
It's been a busy last couple of weeks, but I'm on my way back to Seoul today.   Didn't get near what I wanted to get done on this trip--had planned on heading downtown to see a few buds but couldn't get the time to get away at all.  A few friends made the trek up to our place, though, which was cool.  It's nice to see friends you've known for 10-20 years after being away for a while.  One guy that came up here was a friend of a sister of a friend who is marrying (as soon as he gets the familial blessing) a Korean, so my wife and I gave him the 411 on Koreans and ways to do things.  (More on that when I get back to Seoul, and have more time.)  Got to go now.
A night out in Korea can seem pretty overwhelming, especially in HongDae, Kangnam Sinchon,  urlLink Sincheon , Itaewon, Daehak-ro or any of the other major hotspots in town.  Hongdae, Sinchon and Daehak-ro make a name for themselves by being close to the major universities; Kangnam is a place for lavishing high-priced liquors and girls on clients; Itaewon is near the US Army base, so it's a haven for GIs and other English-speakers (who seem to have more money than brains sometimes, myself included) and Sincheon is a teen district as well, in the well-to-do area of Songpa-gu.  My latest foray was to Daehak-ro (daehak/daehak-kyo means college/university, ro means street).  We went to a ddak-kalbi (grilled chicken) place and saw a group of 3 guys whooping it up Korean style (copious amounts of soju and food and louder speaking).  One was pretty funny. I don't know if he was doing it for my benefit or to show-off to the Koreans around him (Koreans sometimes show that they know English as a form of one-up-man-ship...it shows they are educated and studied a lot, no matter how brutal the usage).  He was saying such things as 'Excuse me, could you calm down?' (actually, he said that A LOT) and 'I'm sorry' and 'Okay!'.  I think he was practicing to be a bar bouncer or something.  Anyways, these guys got pretty loaded.  When one of them was away from the table it looked like the other two were a little amorous (Korean men sometimes hold hands or put their arms around each other, especially after a gallon of soju).  I snapped the picture below before we left.       urlLink     2 guys who really like each other (but they are not gay).   Then when we finished walking nature was calling me...but not #1.  I took a look into the  urlLink hwa-jang-shil  (bathroom) in the restaurant, but it was a squat-type.  Then we came across this theatre (below...oh, and Koreans usually pronounce theatre and Seattle the similarly).  It was new so I took a look.  Man, that bathroom was spotless--maybe it looked so good because I figured that all of the ones in the area were squatters or brutally dirty affairs, as they usually are in smaller, older buildings (man, how do these women do it?).  Anyways, that's the tip.  Look for the newest, hippest building (especially ones with Western food or themes inside) to find the best W.C. (another way Koreans denote watercloset).   urlLink     Fantaseum   Since Korea has millions (ten of millions, likely) of cellphones (handphones, as they call them) you'll find public pay phones only in a few places: the airport, the train/bus stations, major hotels and the subways.  (Well, I've seen them on the street sometimes, but not that often, and not when you need one.)   urlLink     phones   Another instance of Korean marketing gone bonkers.   urlLink Red Mango  is a major bing-soo (shaved ice garnished with fruit and stuff and then topped with yogurt or ice cream).  But the tagline for the firm is a little....well, weird 'Start loving myself!'.  When I explain it to people they really get confused.   urlLink     Red Mango  Another thing here that's funny is girls wear shirts that say '69', it's a brand here but they are oblivious to the hidden meaning (if you don't know I can't explain it here, this site is family-friendly).  Or church-going girls will have a Playboy scrunchie in their hair...not knowing who 'The Hef' is.  Koreans also have no idea the multitude of words we have for a part of the male anatomy (so the scene in  urlLink Austin Powers  where they say 'woody, Johnston, boner, balls, willi...) goes over most of their heads.  They have one word here for it  urlLink go-choo  (hot pepper), and they're pretty surprised to learn that their word for 'ward' in a city (dong) is also another euphemism for gochoo.   urlLink     And, to cap it off, in the subway there was a guy taking a snooze right on the floor.
Some of you may remember my first article on oh-gyup-sal (five layers of fat pork). Oh-gyup-sal is a one-up on sam-gyup-sal (three layers of fat porl), so it only makes sense that this land of hyperbole would come up with chun-gyup-sal (1,000 layers of fat pork)--and it did.  As amazing as it may seem, someone got the great idea of leap-frogging all of the competition and calling what is basically pork chop a name that denotes something a little more superlative.  Why not trillion layers of fat pork (jo-gyup-sal)?  I have no idea.   urlLink     The sign says '1,000 layers of fat pork'...mmmmmmm.   Well, Korea isn't the only place where things get blown out of proportion sometimes, it's just that they do it so well here and we're not used to it.  Who can forget the launch of the  urlLink Gilette Mach 3 ?  Yes, that's what I need!  Three blades on my face!  (Of course they had 'Excel' versions of their Sensor, Mach 3 and ladies' razors, too, as if we needed that little white strip to save from cutting our faces open.)  Recently the  urlLink Schick Quattro  came out (for those of you who failed Latin, Italian, Audi or whatever language this is in: quattro means expensive).  Now Gillette has a 'power' version of its razor.  Now this is getting ridiculous!  Here in Korea I get 10 good razors for 2,000 won (USD 1.75).  (Yes, 17.5c each!)  They're so cheap I only use them twice then throw them away.  (Please no Greenpeace/eco-friendly group flamings.)  And you know what?  I get a pretty good shave out of it, too...similarly I only buy plain ol' pork chops at home.
Sometimes this place really makes me think.  So many things are so different here (language, expressions, people, culture, shopping, driving habits) but, yet, some things are just like home.  Take my building, for instance, there are a few guards (we call them ìì ì¨, ajeosshi, or 'mister') in the lobby...well, they're no so much guards as they are greeters, like at Wal-Mart (neat article  urlLink here ).  After they figured I was not a visitor, but a long term resident of Seoul they started saluting me, waving and saying 'Morning'.  Huh, morning?  Ok, I guess they learned that greeting somewhere. Many Koreans in lower-level jobs know absolutely no English and what they may have learned these old timers probably had long forgotten, so I appreciated the effort.  Then I was inline skating (rollerblading to those of us who can pronounce it easily) one lovely 4AM and another ìì ì¨ said 'Morning!'.  Ok, that's two.  Interesting.  Then I got to thinking (well, it came to me while watching a Kia ad) that Morning is everywhere in Korea.  This morning (there I go again) I saw a give-away paper called ëª¨ë (Korean phonetic of morning) and then recalled the ad for  urlLink Kia's sub-compact car .  A simple search on Google Korea came up with more: an  urlLink online bookstore , an  urlLink online flowershop , a  urlLink golf site  and a  urlLink news organization .  Then there's  urlLink Good Morning Shinhan , one of the largest secutities dealers in Korea--with its flagship building in Yeouido, one of the largest in town and flaunting its name, albeit in Hanguel/Korean text, for all to see.  And, of course, this is the 'Land of the Morning Calm'. I could go on, but you get the point.  'Morning' is not without it's detractors, though.  About a year ago there was a major scam where a real estate developer conned million from many small investors.  One lady summed it up well saying, 'Now I know what it is like to go from a rich person to a begger in one day.' Definately not a good morning for her.  As an aside, apparently another Western idea is hamburgers, and in NORTH KOREA, no less.  (JoongAng Article  urlLink here .)  Here's your factoid for the day: although most words are pronounced and even used differently than the original, Korean has incorporated about 10,000 English words into its language; much like Tagalog/Filipino has a lot of Spanish and we Westerners are comfortable with Bon Appetit and Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto.
A readers will know, shopping in Seoul is a little different from back home (assuming back home is a Western country like Canada, the US, UK...).  For one thing ( urlLink more things here ), you can haggle at almost every 'store' (and some for sure at every place that is not a store, but like the picture below). This includes the 'department stores' like Migliore, Doota and Hello ampm that are in Dongdaemoon (each area actually stalls of independent sellers) but not such high class/price places like Shinsegae or Lotte Depart.  There is also no haggling at Lotte Mart, LG Mart nor E-Mart, but in those places you're getting a bit better surroundings than the true discount stores.  Anyways, I find that haggling is a bit of an art...and it takes a little while to get the hang of it.  After a while you'll wonder why you don't get a discount back home, though.  (There is also  urlLink no tax  on purchases; it's either included in the price or just not paid--especially at street-sellers.)  Like today, I went to Namdaemoon for some shopping, had to get a few undershirts and towels.  I found a seller of both and asked the prices: 2,200 won for a shirt, 1,700 won for a towel...no discount.  Huh, ya, right.  I offered 16,000 (compared to the 16,800 total price...this is NOT a big discount, just 5%, but I was in a hurry and didn't have 5 minutes to haggle for $1.50 off).  She said, 'no discount' again, but I said (in Korean) 'I'm buying 3 of these and 6 of these, discount!' and she relented.  Oh, it helps if you can do simple math in your head (the seller sure as heck can) and if you know enough Korean to at least  urlLink say the prices in Korean .  Otherwise you're a bit of a mark.  Now for this picture.  This 'store' popped up literally right on the street near my work and the sellers were luring the office girls to try on their lovely selection of shoes.  No guarantee, but for $10 a pair and the way fashion trends have the life of a gnat here who cares?   urlLink     Get your ladies shoes right here!
Recently I downloaded Go-Stop (a traditional Korean card game, played almost exclusively by men, Yahoo!'s version is  urlLink here ) to my phone.  (There is one called Sexy-Go-Stop too, for those who are into Anime.)  Well, I've been playing it (the clean version) so much that my battery dies sometimes when I'm out (is this an addiction?).  The last time was out at the movie theatre (the MMC in Dongdaemoon is open 24 hours, if anyone is looking for a flick at 3AM).  A friend of mine said they have chargers at convenience stores (I also remember them at some restaurants too).  Then we found that they had them at the theatre, too.  The young kids there knew how to hook up the battery...they were really helpful, actually.  Koreans are so nice sometimes.  Here's a pic of what to look for if you're in Korea and your phone goes dead.   urlLink     You stick your battery in here for about 5-10 minutes and it's powered up (but the charge wears down more quickly, I think).   More things I like in Korea: delivery services.  I ordered a few books from  urlLink Seoul Selection  (a great foreign bookstore that has an interesting  urlLink newsletter  that's worth subscribing to--it's free).  Anyways I ordered online at 3:00PM. The order showed up at my door at 9:30 the next morning. This would not happen in Canada unless you paid extra for delivery, and even then it'd maybe be 2 nights as I ordered late in the day.  Korea, though has a ubiquitous number of  urlLink quick service delivery services  (as they're called).  This means it takes about 1-2 hours for a package to get across town because a motorbike courier takes it rather than taking it in a van to a sorting station then another van for delivery.  (It's similar to the bike couriers that we have in the West, but no one bikes on the roads here.)  I also like the way Korea updates things.  The pics below show one example.  In the old days there was a rarefied breed of warrior who guarded the main palaces and nobles, today there is another (decidedly more leggy) version.  (Um, this is a joke, for those who believe everything they read.)   urlLink     Changing of the Guard and Twirling of the Rifles.
One of my favorite places in ì¬ìë (Yeouido) is  urlLink Wingswing  located on the second floor of the building behind the Lexington (formerly the New Manhattan) Hotel.  It's run by the son-in-law of a Korean who spent 20 years in New York and Atlanta running similar places...and now the old man is here to revamp it.  They added 2 bar counters and hard liquor (and recipes) as well as more to the menus (spaghetti, quesadillas).  Last time I was there I had Crown Royal (oh, how I love it) and the time before they served us this Flaming Dr. Pepper which is a shot of Bacardi 151 in a glass of beer.  It's not as tasty as the version I know (Amaretto shot in a 50/50 beer/Coke mix) but not bad.  Probably one of the few places in Seoul you can get some of the booze this place has--and the only one in Yeouido.    urlLink     Flaming Dr. Pepper at Wingswing
Over the last few weeks I've been to a couple of Western movies ( urlLink Troy  and  urlLink Spiderman 2 ) and a few Korean ones as well:  urlLink ì¬ì¹ì (Yeochinso/Windstruck) ;  urlLink ì¬ëë³´ì´ (Old Boy) ;  urlLink ê³µê³µìì  (Gong-gong-ui Jock/Public Enemy ;  urlLink ìì¼ëì¹´ë (Wild Card) ; and  urlLink ë²ì£ì ì¬êµ¬ì± (Beomjwi-ui Jaegooseong/The Big Swindle) . I really liked all of the Korean movies (actually the Western ones seemed pretty predictable compared to the Korean fare) but found it interesting that 4 of the 5 (all but Old Boy) were cop movies. (To be fair, in The Big Swindle it was more about the robbers than the cops--still, the theme was intact.) Maybe this is typical to movies in general (going in phases, all of the movies are from the last year) or maybe it's just how (again) in Korea things are very much fads; where once a theme gets started it's difficult to stop it.    urlLink     Public Enemy, WildCard, The Big Swindle and Old Boy    With that in mind, I think of my night out on Saturday. A group of friends and I had dinner and a movie in the ëëë¬¸ ( urlLink Dongdaemoon ) area then headed to ëíë¡ (pronounced Daehan-ro, but the Korean spelling is Dae-Hak-Ro: Daehak means university, ro is street, so (as you may have guessed) it is a street near universities--so, of course, there are tons of bars there). It was raining as a typhoon is in town (see the  urlLink typhoon tracker page  for updates of when one is on its way here) so there weren't many people out on the town. (I, however, didn't mind it as the rain here is pretty warm and I was in shorts a shirt and cut-away sneakers...really quite comfortable.) We went to about 5 places before finding one called ê¾¼ (Kkoon, an intersting name). The gal running the place said it was their first business day, but the place was empty. The music, however, was really good so I said, 'Service.', as in: what will you give us to come in? She offered plates of snacks and such...sold! The prices were lower than I'm used to, too...a good place.   So, how does this connect? The ambiance. The bar was like many other ones out there with tables, low lighting, club music, and a table or two that has a trough in the middle for ice and imported beer and coolers (we had 8 different kinds). I guess this is a safe business strategy as it may be fatal to go out on a limb with a new concept in this town unless it does very well, in which case you'll have lots of imitators.   I wonder what the next trend will be? Whatever it is, it'll catch on fast.  urlLink (JoongAng Ilbo article on this topic.)
In any developing country (and I believe Korea is 'developing' and really only started on the road to a real economy with the onset of real elections in 1994) there can be trials and tribulations for those who lead (politicians, heads of business) and follow (workers, students).  Don't get me wrong, Korea has made gigantic strides in the last 50 years (thanks mainly to the iron-grip of their president/dictator from 1961 to 1979, Park Chung Hee) and in the last 10 years (when Korea really started to open up to Western influences)--but things are still in a state of flux here.  Business practices have changed (although they retain much of the old flavour), politics...well, politics seems to still be the same..., relationships between people has changed (albeit only a little, Koreans still follow Confucius tenets and defer to age, men and the learned) and even language has changed (as the Internet and chatting has lead to the truncation of many words).  With these changes comes inefficiencies.  One can capitalize on them or be a victim.  The lady in the BMW below may have done both.  She is likely enjoying the ride in her Z4, but (according to  urlLink this newspaper article  she is also a victim of over-pricing--something that BMW, I assume, does not mind as they can have a higher profit.  (One other part of this may be that BMW has certain 'import duties' over and above the government ones that need to be paid in order to sell their cars here, such is another inefficiency.)   urlLink     The BMW Z4...a pricey car in this town.   But what about those who cannot afford a luxury car, a flat in Kangnam (the priciest district in Seoul) and an expense account at the local watering hole?  Or worse, those who had it all and then lost it?  What happens to them?  Well, for some, the answer is suicide (hence my mention of  urlLink BASE jumping  (Buildings, Antennae, Spans and Earth) in the title.  Since there are few guns in Korea (heck, many policemen do a  urlLink Barney Fife  and don't even walk around with a loaded gun, the bullets are in their pocket!) the next best thing is jumping.  While inline skating one day near the river I saw police taking 2 jumpers from the water--ug,that was not cool.  Sorry for the imagery.  One thing that irks me about Korea sometimes is the lack of discretion in some matters (one faux pas I probably just committed above).  We know that reporting suicide can lead to more suicides, but they continue to report suicides as they happen.  Some of the stories are truly heart-wrenching and I (yes, even I) weep a bit when I hear some of them--this is not something you get desensitized to.  If you're of strong mind take a look at this article on recent  urlLink suicides .  Of course, it's not just in Korea.  In the  urlLink U.S. military suicide  is the #2 killer (I'm not sure if friendly fire or actual action are #1, you start to wonder sometimes).  The interesting thing I found from reading all of this (not that it makes me an expert by any means) is that Korea, although it may have the 4th highest suicide rate in the 29 OECD countries, it was waaaay down the list globally (Korea always wants to be #1 compared to the top nations, which is why they probably used this statistic).  Countries in Eastern Europe (although some of these 'suicides' may be underworld related), Scandinavia, and even the US and Canada, Hong Kong and Japan had higher rates than Korea did in 1994.  (From Table 1 in  urlLink this paper/abstract  In true Korean fashion, the rates here went from 6.8 per 100,000 in 1998 to 16.5 in 2000 and 18.1 in 2002...man, does everything here have a  urlLink logarithmic curve  to it?  Some also turn to  urlLink murder , such as happened 10 years ago and lately again (and I'm sure there were other cases in-between), but that's another story.  Perhaps this is just another part of living in a place where the past is meeting the future head on.
Koreans have an interesting saying when referring to guys like me: ê¸°ë¬ê¸°ìë¹  ( urlLink gi-reo-gi  a-ppa, wild goose dad).  Whenever I told Koreans that I was here and my wife and kids are in Vancouver they would call me this, and now I know why.  My boss explained it to me quite well (although he called the bird a  urlLink seagull , as many Koreans do).  It goes like this: a goose flies very high in the sky (so does a vulture, but I guess that's not as poetic, nor as flattering) and has very good eyesight.  Therefore, it can see things waaaay in the distance--which is good, because that's where a ê¸°ë¬ê¸°ìë¹ 's family is...across the ocean.  It is used for Koreans who go abroad to work, as many do in the Middle East on the many Korean-lead construction projects there, for the many families that have the wife and kids in a foreign place (especially Canada, especially Vancouver...there are so many there) and the dad stays in Seoul, and for guys like me who come to work but whose wife likes Vancouver soooo much she can't bear to live in Seoul and put the children through such torture as is living here.  It's just another part of Korea where things that don't make a lot of sense at first seem to be clearer once you get the whole story.   urlLink     The majestic, beautiful Canada goose.
This  urlLink Korea Times Business Section editorial  speaks of Jwa Seung-hee's (president of an economic research institute for the Federation of Korean Industries) 10 mysteries of the Korean economy.  #1 Western-style economic reform has eroded the dynamism of the Korean economy.  #2 Seoul has become bigger and bigger despite the government's policy of balanced regional development.  #3 The rural community's life has become dismal despite the policy of promoting the balanced development of the rural and urban communities.  #4 Income disparity has widened despite the policy of promoting egalitarianism and redistributive policies.  #5 Competitiveness of small companies has weakened despite the policy of curbing chaebol.  #6 Economic concentration has deepened despite the policy to diffuse the concentration of economic power.  #7 The exodus of primary, middle and high school students for overseas study has increased as the government seeks to standardize schools.  #8 Government control of finance has deepened amid sloganeering for financial liberalization.  #9 The Roh administration seeks to scrap the Park Chung-heeâs economic development model, which created the Miracle on the Han River. #10 The government has strengthened policies, which would erode corporate competitiveness.  To this business/economic list I'd like to add a cultural 10 mysteries of modern Korean culture, if I may.  #1 Koreans often speak of love for their children and the sanctity of marriage but many men (and women) have lovers on the side. #2 Many Korean parents (or grandparents) insist that children marry Koreans, even though they send their kids overseas to study, or to hagwons (language academies) here. (N.I.M.F.T Not In My Family Tree) #3 Everyone seems to like the promise that is living in a different country, but very few can make the move out of Korea. #4 Koreans (especially the young) love the outdoors and clean air, but they hate to live in the country. #5 Korean students hate learning English, but older ones seem to love taking English classes. #6 Even after years of incredible progress Koreans always compare themselves to foreigners: the Rodeo Drive of Seoul, the Silicon Valley of Korea, the Harvard of Korea. #7 Most Koreans seems to have a negative attitude toward U.S. soldiers here (especially those who served in KATUSA-Korean Army Training with U.S. Army) but they don't seem to want them to leave (and leave South Korea vulnerable). #8 Koreans spend 10-16 hours a day (for years on end) studying for major exams but at the end of it all don't seem to have a stored library of knowledge to use in everyday life (or even at work!). #9 Koreans are very (over) protective of their children, and yet they have few child restraint seats and no one uses seatbelts in the back seats. #10 Many Koreans have dogs as pets, but many other Koreans eat dog!  Another interesting story came to me from a friend of mine. A group of 20 or so young people were on the subway when it came to a station with about 20 older folks waiting to get on.  The kids were sitting down in the seats, but without a word or any signals they ALL stood up together and offered their seats to the older folks.  Unreal.  The more things change, the more things stay the same.
urlLink     Paris Lovers...what a happy couple.   Looking at Korea one can see something of a Leave it to Beaver mindset when it comes to relationships--especially in the minds of 20-something girls here.  One could compare it (as I will) to a monk living life in a temple and then having everything changed when he starts to see what happens over the hills where he makes his home.    Thankfully, some movies are starting to show that life may not be what we assume.  Recently I watched  urlLink Hi, Dharma!  ( urlLink a story about a gang of criminals that hides out in a monastery ) and  urlLink In-eo Gong-ju  (literally means mermaid princess, but is translated to My Mother the Mermaid or Little Mermaid; a story about a daughter who somehow visits her parents when they first meet and fall in love).  Dharma is a comedy where the gangsters find out something about themselves within the (relative) purity of the monks and the monks gain a new perspective from their dichotic encounters.  Both learned that their so-called 'pure' states (of peace or brutality) are not perfect and they can grow from knowing one another.   The daughter in Mermaid had a revelation as well.  She hated her parents (her father seemed a dim-witted postal worker and her mother a cussing rubber/masseuse at a bathhouse).  She wished she were an orphan like her boyfriend.  An odd occurrence (I still don't know how this happened) put her back in time to when her parents met on  urlLink Jeju-do  where her mother was a diver (mermaid connection) and her father a postman.  She comes to see them in their innocence and pure state--full of dreams and potential; not the broken and bitter people they became.  A picture taken at that time shows the village in and around their first bus and her young father on his bicycle, smiling.  The daughter asks her mother why he is smiling...and in the last scene her mother says, 'Of course he is smiling, what else could he be doing?' (or words to that effect).  Yes, the young have every reason to smile.   urlLink     My Mother the Mermaid and Hi, Dharma!   Mermaid seems to show that the 'pure' state of youth and promise is a transient one and Dharma could be saying that moving from purity may actually be good (adding another dimension for growth).  This is something that some young people here don't seem to grasp...they need to have perfect grades to get into the perfect university and get the perfect job and marry the perfect spouse and have the perfect family (which means grandsons for many parents and in-laws).  Perhaps in the future less emphasis will be placed on keeping up with the Kims/Joneses but for now many still aspire to a pure and perfect dreamlife.  Of course, if they don't marry the perfect person Koreans can now  urlLink get a divorce  quite easily...which is another problem.
I must have been nuts.  Every 2-3 months I take off to Canada for 1-3 weeks.  My latest trip ended in late June, and I ended up getting into Incheon on Sunday (June 27th) evening...just missing the Canada Day party.  (Canada Day is on July 1st, but they staged the party early so it'd land on a holiday.)  Last year it apparently sucked and the beer was OB (local brew), not a Canadian lager so I thought I might not be missing much.  Man, what a mistake that was (as you can see from the pic below).   urlLink     Canadian guys chugging beer...Canadian gals striking a pose. Click to see larger version.

Just so you know, this blog isn't about being political. If anything, it's about as apolitical as you can get for blogging. However, there is something that I wanted to comment on: you can use it to form your views or not. Oh, and I talk about some of the important points in here, so if you're going to see the movie bookmark this and read it later.    Last night I saw  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  (click for a  urlLink local review  and a trip to the  urlLink warroom ). It was a pretty good film. I had seen a few clips from it so I had an idea of what to expect, which was kind of unfortunate. Some said 'you'll laugh, you'll cry' and I think knowing that dampened the mood a bit. It may have been better if I didn't know what to expect (and, sorry, now you know kind of what to expect so I opened a bit of Pandora's Box for you too).   When getting the required popcorn and drinks (5,000 won, 4.50USD for a large tub and 2 drinks!) I was greeted by this guy (below). I had to say, 'That's quite a get-up you got there', knowing/hoping he wouldn't understand. At the door to the actual theatre a guy and a gal in the same costume did a little salute as everyone filed in. I didn't think about them again until the end of the movie.    urlLink      Soon he'll be wearing a different uniform.    Fahrenheit 9/11 was a pretty interesting show. It tweaked a few memories I had from that day. When it happened I was in bed in Vancouver, just waking up. As a stockbroker I was wired to the daily news and had turned on my T.V. at 5:50AM. The news of the first plane was already broken and I was thinking, 'What the heck? Some moron pilot slammed into one of the largest buildings in the world? Was it a terrorist?' When the second one hit I think we all knew that it was no accident.   I watched it all that morning. Waiting for the fires to be brought under control; or maybe for another plane to hit another tower. Who could tell what might happen? It was especially surreal for guys like me, I think (egotistical, eh?). My dream, as any guy in finance would have,&nbsp;was to&nbsp;be to be in Windows on the World (the posh restaurant at the top of one of the towers) giving a high-powered presentation to the money-men of New York and the world. That dream seemed more like a death sentence now. I don't know what the emotion was, but you might say I was relieved that I didn't go to Wharton or have a CEO dad who might get me into that room on that day. Of course you didn't have to be a financier to be there, many blue-collar people (firefighters and police) and 'regular Joes and Janes' were there as well.   The next day I went to work. It was quite odd. There was little to do and there was an eerie quiet as the sounds of the harbor-planes were absent. All I could think about was the day before. I still wonder why the heck they showed the towers getting hit and then crashing to Earth so many times in the weeks following. It sure didn't help my spirits.   Back to the movie. I knew what Michael Moore was up to when he made this film. His previous works included: Roger & Me (where he went looking for the CEO of GM (Roger Smith) for answers why his hometown of Flint, Michigan was laid waste by layoffs by the firm) and Bowling for Columbine (where he looked into the psychology of guns and violence that may have lead to the Columbine shootings). I saw a show or something with him as he went all over the country promoting his newest book and noting that the employees of the bookstores were basically getting shafted by their employers (part-timers with no benefits, low salaries, fired for small errors...hmmm sounds like Korea in some ways!). Now, I'm in finance, mostly of the idea that business is good, so even though I found the anecdotes he collected to be interesting and in some cases a little unsettling it didn't really change my thinking much. (I think most of us are pretty set in our ways unless we get overwhelming evidence over a long period of time.) I knew that Moore would be going after Bush, but I had no idea how much he had on him (or at least how bad he could make him look).   Moore's 9/11 was, as a documentary should be, presented as a well-researched, factual and intellectual piece. It went into the histories of the major participants (although not much on Saddam and I was worried about how he said that Iraq never hurt an American: some of it smelled of hyperbole) and presented the facts in logical sequence. Then he threw in a curveball. He had a gal in there (a wife and mother) who, in the beginning, loved the U.S. and the armed forces a lot. She carried her American flag out each day to hang on the front of her house--careful NEVER to let it touch the ground. Later, after her son died, she hated what had happened in her country. I'll tell you the worst part was how she was given the news--it was OVER THE PHONE! I remember in  urlLink We Were Soldiers  the Army sent the notices to the next of kin by taxicab (delivered by the drivers, no less) as there were so many dead they did not have enough officers to do the job. That, I thought was a low point, but this story plumbed the depths.   Clearly, Moore was not trying merely to make President Bush look bad (he made virtually&nbsp;everyone--Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice--look unprofessional, but he could have done that to any of us who have been in front of the camera). He could have easily made the soldiers in Iraq look like unfeeling grunts bent on discharging their weapons at anything and anyone (which, it seems, they did do at times, but that was chalked up to the adrenaline rush of being in a hot zone). No, he went at things on a bit of a different tact. He personified not only the soldiers, but something more identifiable not only for Americans but for anyone who had a loved one in any country's armed services--he made a poster child of those who are left behind (temporarily or permanently) when a service member heads off on assignment in this mother who lost her son.   The mother (pictured below) is the real story and storyteller here. President Bush is a major figure, Moore is the one who brought it all together, but its her story that hits home more than any other. No 9/11 inquiry or senate committee can take away from her and her family's loss. Her husband said it best, though, when he said, 'We are very sad to lose our son in the war, but we are more sad to know that families all over America are having the same thing happen to them right now.' (I'm paraphrasing from my fallible memory, but I think you get the point.) It's the families that suffer(ed) when 800+ troops were killed in Iraq. (We also can't forget the loss of those in WTC, a disaster that was foreshadowed specifically in Presidential Briefings.)&nbsp; For some their will to support the President and perhaps America itself may have been broken. I thought of our popcorn-seller (above) and how his family would react if he were shipped of to war, trading one uniform for another. What if my son(s) were sent off without an imminent threat, as we had in WWII and other 'respected' wars? How could you be proud of a country that did that to its children?    urlLink      Who is the main character in Fahrenheit 9/11? President George W. Bush? Michael Moore? or the mother of a fallen soldier?    So, what is next? Will there be a sequel in a few years? Perhaps Fahrenheit 38 Degrees? (Meaning the parallel of latitude that splits North and South Korea, and translated to Celsius that's just 3.3 degrees--close to freezing, kind of a cold war, which is what we have here: a war, but no open hostilities.) I doubt, after all this, that Bush (or any U.S. President for the next while) has the political muscle to go after North Korea, and that's just fine by me. Heck, if anything happens Seoul is within range of the North's artillery (!), to say nothing of any missiles they may have that could get airborne (and if the U.S. says they don't have the capabilities I'm inclined now to think that maybe they do).   Some things are different in Korea. For one, the two Koreas are still, technically, at war. Only an armistice (or cessation of open combat) was signed, not a peace treaty. I read the North signed it but the U.S. declined to sign it--hearkening to Moore's idea that the military-industrial-political complex needs a 'constant state of high alert and confusion' to reach its aims (which are, mainly, focused on money).    I'm going to digress for a little bit here, sorry.  Much of what we know as culture can be traced back to war. For instance, the Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford that former President Bill Clinton received was founded by  urlLink Cecil Rhodes : one of the wealthiest and most powerful men of his time (so much so that the country of Zimbabwe's former name is Rhodesia, named after him). He made him money from exploitation of South African diamond mines--a country which was finally conquered by the Boer Dutch in 1902, the same year Rhodes died. As well, the respected  urlLink Nobel Prize  was founded by Alfred Nobel who made his money from a little product he invented: dynamite/T.N.T. A technological triumph that is best known as 'the thing that makes things blow up', as an explosives expert might put it.    Back to Korea.  Here there is really no question of whether the leaders are looking out for the people or themselves. A  urlLink recent article  reported that 74% of respondent to a survey of Koreans said they believe politicians are law-breakers. Maybe the same is true in the U.S., but 74% pretty much tells you that people here don't need a Michael Moore documentary to know what goes on behind closed doors. (I'm not sure if that is a good thing.)   The difference here, though, is the threat. As I said, there is still a war going on. South Korea has a mandatory term of military service for all male citizens with an  urlLink 18-month jail sentence  for those who do not comply (of course with a criminal record comes no chance of a job with the government or any larger company, so it's actually more of a life sentence). In the U.S. service is voluntary, it may be seem coerced given the salespitch of the recruiting officers, but it is, in the end, voluntary. Those who are in the service and do not want to be (re-)deployed to a place like Iraq are subject to court martial and possible imprisonment. Again, the difference here is North Korea has been saying for over 50 years that they are the real rulers of the Koreas and they will take back the South; while Iraq did not make (according to Moore, I'm not sure about this point) threats toward the U.S. North Korea also does not have any resources (something that can't make the economy in that non-trading country very viable).   Anyways, this is a record blog length for me, and I'm glad you came along for the ride. My last word is simply that after Moore's 9/11 movie I think many people, myself included, will start to ask more questions and make creating such wars (if I may go so far as that) harder to do in the future...and that, I imagine, was its intent.
Korea is, as you may have guessed, a hyper-competitive place. Once a store, restaurant or whatever they always make a big deal of it. One of the best ways they have to get attention is dancing girls. Ya, you heard right. Girls in cheerleader-like outfits dancing up a storm to hiphop in front of a balloon arc and inflated animals of some sort. It's really quite a sight. When my cousin visited here last year we saw 2 or 3 of these things...his 20-year-old brain was probably about to overload. This display I saw in Namdaemoon as I did some light shopping (actually I needed more hankies as mine was soppign wet from the heat & humidity here these days). Have no idea what this store is, but I was sure tempted to take a look. (Guess the marketing works.)    urlLink      Welcome to the Grand Opening of...um...I forget...where am I anyways?    Then we have  urlLink Bricx , a little place I've walked past but didn't see a reason to enter...maybe now, however.    urlLink      I'm not one for anime usually, but this one...    It took me a while to read it correctly. Usually they say things like 'free drinks (upon paying cover of 20,000 won)' or something. I know  urlLink Ohoo/Hodge Podge  has free drinks for ladies on Thursdays from 10-midnight, but this one is a little more interesting. All gals in bikini tops get free drinks at Bricx on that night...hmmmm. I wonder what they'd do if I showed up in my bro/manzeer.   Finally, take a look at  urlLink Seoul Pub's  video on  urlLink 'Picking up in Seoul'  on  urlLink Seoul Scene's website . It's pretty corny...but mostly funny. The Aussie in the rugby jersey is a regular there (I mean like every night, which is probably why he's featured so prominently).&nbsp; They've got another one called  urlLink Bondaegi Challenge  in which unsuspecting passer-bys are asked to eat....ready for this?...steamed silkworm larvae. It's actually quite well liked here.     UPDATE:   I didn't make it to the Bikini Party, but here are some pics taken at it:  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .
I was going to hold off on writing this until I had a ton of pics of some of the public  urlLink washrooms  they have here, but I had a pretty brutal experience in one today so I figured that was a sign or something. Here's a restroom to avoid: near Line 4 at Seoul Station Subway...unreal. As soon as I walked in I noticed the floor was dirty, which is normally ok, a little dirt isn't the end of the world. Then I noticed a pungent odor...really brutal, actually. If I didn't have to go so bad (#1) I might have bolted, but instead I just let it go...man, did I regret that. I tried breathing through my hanky, but it didn't work, the smell permeated everything. I was getting light-headed from lack of oxygen and barely made it out of there. Man, I think they cleaned that place last when Park Chung Hee was in power (1961-1979). Ugh!   Below are some interesting shot. Take special note that they were all taken from the hallway of the building, not inside the restroom. Thus, anyone walking by could not only see the empty stalls (which is a faux pas in the West as it is) but also the user of it if it is occupied. Some also have a fantastic view from outside, just in case you want two audiences.    urlLink      All of these pictures were from the hallway, not inside the actual bathroom!    The one below is interesting. This bar in Daehak-ro is the only place you can dance in the whole district (or so its sign says) but it's also the most interesting bathroom. There is a door/window right beside the urinal that opens out to the alley. It lets in a nice breeze, but makes one feel like a bit of an exhibitionist.    urlLink       On the left:  that's a door/window that looks into an alley...and anyone can look in.  On the right:  in Lotte Department Store there is a bathroom manager and worker...posh!    Many buildings have bathroom attendants but here they not only have a check-list sheet (as they have in the West in many places) but also the picture of the attendant that cleans it (I guess in case you want to pick them out of a crowd: 'Hey, don't you clean my office's bathroom?') and in the one above there is a 'manager' and attendant responsibile for the cleanliness of the washroom. If only they were at Seoul Station on Line 4's, I might not have almost lost my lunch.
Ah,  urlLink the monsoon season has ended  and thus begins the  urlLink dog days of summer  on the peninsula. I promised myself that I'd never be in Korea (and especially in Seoul) for this, but it looks like I'll be here for about half of August. Oh...my....God! It will be so hot.   Many Koreans take this hot weather as  urlLink an opportunity to take time off  (what with the continued fazing in of the 5-day workweek here) and have some ice cream (there are so many awesome flavors here, priced from 500-1000 won, or just 0.45-0.90 USD!).   Of course Koreans have a penchant for doing the moderately illogical as well. Today the owner of a íë°©ì¼ê³í (han-bang-sam-gye-tang, extra healthy ginseng chicken soup) place ( urlLink not this one, but close ) came by the office. I actually was able to use my pitiful Korean to confirm that his place is in the basement of some building and that the price was 8,000 won (7USD, not bad). Then a friend of mine said it must be because we are in ì´ë³µ (cho-bok) or the start of the dog days. Anyways, as you may know, Koreans have 2 things they need in life: to be warm and to be well fed. Samgyetang is served literally boiling hot (they even have special stoves to fire up the bowls) so you'd think it's best served in the winter...oh no...Koreans love it best in the summer (as if it's not hot enough!). Well, this is Korea, so I'll likely have a burning bowlfull at lunch with the throngs. (When I asked why Koreans like hot food in the summer the only response was: because it's good for your health.) It'll make the air conditioned office that much more inviting.  Oh, and another reason they call it the 'dog days' is they like to also have ë³´ì í (boshintang) or dog soup. Yup,  urlLink they eat dogs here (read story if you've got a strong stomach) . It's the typical Korean food reasons: it's good for men's stamina (as in: stamina between the sheets, the only kind they care about) and for women's skin (gals here are a little preoccupied with good skin). Many guys, especially older ones, and 'talents' (which is what they call any celebrity, star, singer, actor) dine on dog in order to excel in bed or in front of the camera.
urlLink Samsung has a new phone ...with a THREE megapixel camera.  LG and Panitec/Curitel have similar ones out as well.  The only problem is the things are about 700,000 won (600USD).  So, I'll wait a bit until I get a new phone/dica (digital camera, as they abbreviate it here).  For now, I'm having fun taking pictures of interesting things I see in this crazy place.  Like this address plate.  It says: 21, Yangmalsan, 5 gil or: building 21, sock mountain (area) 5th road.   urlLink     Building address in Yeouido aka Sock Mountain.   I asked my boss (pictured below) about why the heck a road is called Sock Mountain...it didn't make much sense, even for this place.  He told me that Yeouido use to be called Sock Mountain...why?  No idea.  Now the place is full of investment houses, the National Assembly (parliament/senate/capitol building) and (following the money) bars and brothels...no sock factories.    urlLink     My boss mixing SINGLE MALT SCOTCH WHISKY and Korean beer.   The whole office went out last night for &#50724;&#44217;&#49332; (oh-gyup-sal, or 5-layers-o'-fat-pork).  We have a new company member and, true to Korean form, that's a great excuse to have food and (a lot of) drink.  My boss, please forgive him, brought the bottle of 1950 Macallan single malt Scotch I got him on my last trip back and then (oh my God, I can hardly believe he did this!) proceeded to fill shot glasses with it and drop them in glasses of OB (Oriental Brewery, a local malt-maker) lager.  Unreal.  Now, my grandfather worked for Seagram's (and has Scottish heritage) and two of our suppliers are right from Scotland and if they saw such a travesty they probably would have throttled him--hence the pixelated face, a little taste of the witness protection program tactics he'll have to face for such an injustice to Scotsmen everywhere.  (Oh, FYI, only single malt whisky from Scotland can call itself 'whisky' minus the 'e', all others are properly spelt 'whiskey'.)  Good thing I had my cameraphone at the ready to take these breathtaking shots, eh?
It's been a while.  Been busy.  Was entertaining a British friend of mine (originally from Manchester, now in K.L.-Kuala Lumpur) who has basically been ruined by Asia.  You see, once a Western guy comes here he can hardly go back to life in the West...you'll know if you're here.  Two other Aussie brothers I know had the same thing--they both work for investment banks in Seoul and Shanghai and speak the respective languages, to life is good for them, too.  (Same effect for Korean women who go to places like Vancouver, they can't bear to leave that place either.)  Anyways, his business partner (an Aussie) was in town with him too...first time...so we went out for a few nights.  Also, some American and a Dutch friend of mine and some Koreans wanted to go out too...and then a couple of nights for business...like I said, been busy.  We went to DaeHak-ro and had &#49436;&#54588;&#46041;&#54028; (seo-pi-dong-pa; seo=west; pi=(pi)zza; dong=east; pa=(pa)-jun, a Korean kind of omlette; together they are western pizza/eastern omlette) and &#46041;&#46041;&#51452; (dong-dong-ju,a kind of immature makkoli, or rice booze).  Man, was it goood.  The dong-dong-ju, it looks like porridge but tastes light (the porridge look is actually ice crystals held in the mixture, no idea how they make it so consistent).  On the way out I almost invariably take the subway.  It's fast, clean, convenient and is unaffected by the recent torrential downpours (it's monsoon/typhoon season here now).  It's interesting, some stations are a little micro-city with shopping areas (some really large), links to office and apartment buildings, restaurants and almost everything else.  They all have a few things in common: lockers (which I wondered about before, but now I've used them a few times to store things I bought--and at about $1 a day they're a pretty good deal), payphones (something you don't see a lot of overground), washrooms (some are better than others), a lotto booth and usually a little convenience store, gift shop, flower shop and/or food seller.   urlLink     Amenities: lockers, PC bang, escalators.   I don't know why, but many of the subway stops here are spruced up a bit.  They have things like (below) lighted signs on the air conditioner units, aquariums (they call them fishbanks here) and posters for the Seoul Subway Corp. that show scenes totally unrelated to subway travel.   urlLink     Subway Art: an air conditioner, a fishbank and a Seoul Subway Corp. poster   There's also art shows sometimes.  There was one for international children's art this weekend at Hyehwa station: I saw 2 good ones: one was from China and another one (aptly named Snow in Canada) was from my home country.  Ahhh...a little piece of home.   urlLink     World Children's Art: China and Canada   That's it for now...later.
Man, it's been busy lately. Out every night working (here that means having drinks with friends, clients, suppliers and partners (business partners, that is, I'm not into the girlfriend scene). Thus, all I've got today is  urlLink a link to this other blog . Some funny scenes from the Seoul Subway system. Enjoy.   Oh, and  urlLink as I reported earlier , Bricx Bar had a Bikini Party last Friday. I didn't make it there, but here are some pics taken at it:  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .
Ok, you're probably looking at that title and wondering what the heck the connection is. It's tenuous, but here goes. First, these are four countries I likely will not drive in (although I did drive in the Philippines, or Phil, but that was in my younger days) the first three because of the amount of nuttiness I've either witnessed or assumed is there and the last one because I don't think I'd spend much time away from the beach.   Ok, so about this Korean driving stuff. I've been here for almost 2 years and always get the question: 'do you have a car?' My answer, I think, is pretty logical. No, because (i) the subway system here is cheap, easy and pretty fast (no traffic); (ii) the bus system is not prefect, but once you know which one to take it's quite nice; (iii) our firm has a driver and  urlLink Hyundai   urlLink Equus  for visits on company business; (iv) taxis are everywhere in this city and are pretty inexpensive; (v) my work is like 20 meters from home; and (iv) driving here is not like in Canada (either I'd cause an accident here or get used to this way and cause one when I drive back home). Thus, no need for a car. Actually, I try to stay off the roads whenever possible here.   Perhaps this is for good reason, Korea has one of the highest traffic fatality and injury record in the developed/developing world. It's really quite amazing. Take a look at these articles ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) and you'll see what I mean. One reason is  urlLink many Koreans do not use seatbelts  (another article  urlLink here ). Even I don't, when I'm in the back seat--especially of a taxi. It's really quite odd (and scary) that I always buckle up at home but take my life into my own hands when I'm here...perhaps simply because everyone does it here.   People who do come here to drive have to get used to the rules of the road, as described in  urlLink this article  from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. And if you hit someone the driver is almost always at fault in some respect (more on that  urlLink here ).   So, what's the connection to Greece?  urlLink Korean drivers licenses will be considered valid in Greece . I'm not sure why, it certainly isn't valid in Canada, you have to do a new test and everything there, but for some reason Greece has opened the doors for Koreans to take to its streets, probably because of the Olympics. ( urlLink Apparently Greece is famous for some crazy driving as well .) But then, isn't that a brutal time for Koreans (or any foreigners) to be tooling around town in a rental? Oh well, I'm certainly not going to Greece anytime soon, and if I did I'd probably call  urlLink George the Super-Cabbie .   So, on to Phil. I went there with a bud in December 1998 (most of this file is classified, so this'll be short). One of the highlights was driving from  urlLink Cebu City  (where Ferdinand Magellan was  urlLink beheaded by King Lapu Lapu  way back when) to  urlLink Moalboal , the noted diving spot. It was about a 3 hours trip on provincial (read: rural, goat/dog/child/rickshaw-strewn) road and on the way back Carlo was at the wheel. For some reason a dog was on the road and Carlo tried to avoid it (really, he did swerve like 3 times, the thing just changed direction again!) but, in the end, it became one with the rubber. Also, a kid jumped on the road and pointed a gun at us (I hope it was a toy, but you never know). With that I started to really question why I'd be at or near the wheel of a vehicle in Phil or any other developing country.   Carlo and I returned to Canada safely and got back to work at  urlLink RBC Dominion Securities  where we worked (did I note that we started on the same day and had the same briefcase?) but within 2 years the both of us made moves to other firms. I was in Canada a while longer before coming here and Carlo went to first  urlLink Turks & Caicos Islands  then to  urlLink Cayman Islands . He left then returned to RBC and, as you can see from the pics below, is an avid flagger, I mean flag football player.  Ya, he goes long on the field and goes short in the office.  (haha! a little finance/hedge fund humor there for ya!)   urlLink     Watch out Carlo! Looks like that big dude's got your number! Good thing it's flag football.    Right now he's Player of the Week! Way to go Carlo! His profile is  urlLink here  and his league's site is  urlLink here  (Carlo, why is the domain dot K-Y??). Oh, and ladies, too late, he has a girlfriend and a baby on the way.    urlLink     Lookin' a little rotund there, Carlo.   Well, that's the story, from crazy driving to driving to the end zone in one blog.
I'd like to thank my bud Peter in Vancouver for the picture below. It shows me that it's  urlLink not just Koreans  that are into voyeurism (although the Swiss version has one-way glass so people can't see in, and the Korean versions have none such discretion, it seems).    urlLink      Is it me? Or does she look like Martha Stewart? And doesn't that look like a prison cell loo?    I was out last night on a íì (hwi-shik), which basically means a bender with guys from the office. We went to my favorite local haunt, Outsider. It's called a 'playing bar' in English but in Korean they call it a ìì£¼ì´ë°´í¸ë° (yang-joo ee-ben-t-ba, whiskey event bar). Basically, it's not a room salon but it's nicer than a regular hof (or local Korean pub). There are girls pouring the drinks but they are ALWAYS on their side of the bar (which is just fine by me).   Of course that wasn't all that we did. We had ì¼ê²¹ì´ (3-layer fat pork, much like backbacon) first and went to WA Bar (when you say the name it sounds like the Korean for 'come here', very apt methinks) afterward. Man, I love living in Yeouido...at least I can get home within 50 steps instead of taking a bus or cab for 20-60 minutes to get home. Sometimes I think I'm a little spoiled here...but then I remember the pollution, long hours and compulsory drinking and I figure it about evens out.    urlLink      Um, where's his other hand!??!    So, anyways, this morning I got out of bed at about 4am to do laundry (wild and crazy guy that I am). I was still drunk, obviously, and ended up not checking my shirt pocket for the namecard (that's what they call business cards here) of the new guy (the one on the left in the pic; the middle guy, Yoon, is our new recruit and the guy on the left is Jo-last name-by the way, I think Jo should have the English name of Danny or Daniel, what do you think?). So, it got washed...damn. Well, at least I know what he looks like. Him, Yoon and I are all born in the same year, but I am a few months older, so we can be friends. It's odd here, even a year or so difference and you're considered on a different plane in some respects. Jo is our junior...so we have to take care of him/get him plastered. The nice thing about being a little older is I can pull rank and make everyone drink. hahahaha! But as a ì¸êµ­ì¸ (way-gook-in, foreigner) I can also claim to be untouchable (in the good sense) if I don't want to do something. hahahaha! (But I usually do it because it's not a good idea to play the race card too much here.)   I had to get myself some coffee this morning, but felt cheap (as usual) as there is wonderful  urlLink Maxim Mocha Gold  sticks in the office. I'm sure these things are killing me slowly, but they're just sooo convenient! Also heard that  urlLink Starbucks just opened their 100th store in Korea  (in Itaewon, actually). Yesterday was it's 5th anniversary in Korea...and I remember when I first came here (about 5 years ago, actually) they were just starting. In typical Korean fashion they caught on like wild-fire (foreign, expensive, addictive...what's not to love?)   One last thing. Koreans have a special numbering system for counting things, but they can't do the same in English, it seems. They seem to think that 'th' comes after every number. My namecards say that we are on the 2th floor...well, we're not, the ì¹ê³¼ (chi-gwa, dentist) is on the first floor. Then today on T.V. I saw an electronic device that was labeled '2rd cable port'...at least they were trying on that one.
Last night I saw  urlLink Silmido . Man, it reminded me of The Dirty Dozen. The (true) story is: the North sent a platoon (31 men) of commandos to Seoul in January 1968 to kill then-president/dictator Park Chung Hee (he was later assassinated by a cabinet member in 1979). Their plan was thwarted, but the South wanted revenge so they set up an ultra-secret crack team of 31 (always have copy, it seems) of their own. But, they didn't recruit from the general infantry or even the armed forces at all. The members of Unit 684, as it was called, were criminals on death row who (they found out afterwards) were already known as dead to the world and, thus, would not be missed if they failed (or if they succeeded).   The 31 went through extensive and brutal training on Silmido (Silmi Island) but 31 real special forces members plus a commander. For 2 years they prepared themselves physically and mentally to 'slit the throat of Kim Il-Sung' (the leader of NK at the time, and father of the current dictator, Kim Il-Jung). The time to leave and complete their mission came and they set out to Pyongyang...but at the last moment it was cancelled. The Minister of Intelligence had changed and relations had thawed between the two Koreas (I wonder what catastrophe would have befallen this place if they had succeeded). With no reason to be, Unit 684 was to be terminated.   The story goes on a ways from there, and everyone knows it..which may have been the point of the South Korean government. Imagine if a foreign power (and hated enemy) sent a team to kill President Bush or John Major...how could they just let it go. But, as in this case, how could they let it happen? This sacrificing of deathrow inmates makes sense from a political point of view. The South got to show that they were ready, willing and able to go after Kim Il-Sung, but, in the end, it would have probably put the Peninsula back in to a brutal and devastating war.    urlLink     Silmido and The Dirty Dozen: the true story is more unreal than fiction.    At least The Dirty Dozen achieved their mission...but it was just a story, maybe based on Silmido, who knows?
Yahoo! Finally, after being in Seoul for almost 2 years we closed our first deal. I had almost given up on this place/market, but looks like we've go our foot in the door. Never give up is the motto here. Reminds me of a client of mine I had in Vancouver. I knew he was quite wealthy and invested in my area, but it took 2 years to get an account out of him...for $500,000. He said to me three words I'll never forget: persistance beats resistance. Man, what a lesson that was.   A friend of mine from  urlLink Geoje-do  (cool blog about teaching experiences on Geoje-do  urlLink here ) came up this weekend with a couple of buds from the Island. One (Andy) has a friend in concert promotion and they had 2 VIP tickets to the  urlLink MTV Buzz Asia Concert  (sponsored by the super-cool  urlLink iriver  company-article  urlLink here ) at Chamshil Indoor Stadium (which I think is the same as the  urlLink Jamshil Auxiliary Stadium ). Thanks Andy!   I had no idea it would be so packed. We got there just after 7PM, when it started. We read the part on the ticket about first come/first served, but missed the line about 'doors will be open at 4pm'. Whoops (Koreans probably made a day out of it and came at noon, knowing them). Well, the place was full, but our VIP friends were already in. The gal (Anne) came out and (owing to her sister who works with the Prince tours showing her the tricks of the trade) she not only got us into the stadium but into basically any seating area that wasn't already full. Thanks Anne!   The acts were pretty cool. We missed the first one,  urlLink ë³´ì/BoA  but caught the rest. Take a look at the pics below of BoA,  urlLink Jaurim  and  urlLink Shinhwa . For all the boy bands/acts I tried to get the most masculine pictures I could for my site, but if you want fruitier ones they're all over their sites. (I sometimes wonder about these guys, but at least the girls are hot.)    urlLink      BoA, Jaurim and Shinhwa.    There were a few J-Pop and Taiwanese acts too:  urlLink Namie Amuro ,  urlLink Vanness Wu  and  urlLink Wang Lee Hom . There were a couple of others, but the names were in Chinese and I'm feeling a little lazy now.    urlLink      Namie Amuri, Vanness Wu and Wang Lee Hom.    So, as you know, Koreans love to get together and eat and drink, that's why the after-party was so cool. It was in the uber-tony area of  urlLink Apkujungdong . It's home of the highest priced real estate (and women) in all of Korea. Yes, I'm sure I saw many genuine Fendi bags and plastic bodies. The best part was the 2 free drink tickets. Ah, there's the Scot in me speaking again. The next day we hung out in lovely  urlLink Yeouido Park  (another review  urlLink here ) where we fed the birds (below). It reminded me of the flocking to the afterparty/bar/dancefloor the night before...birds of a feather and all that.    urlLink      The gatherings: concert, afterparty, in the park.      urlLink Here's another flocking ...of Koreans to the beach in Pusan. I think the caption says there are 1,000,000 people there at the beach (about 2/3 of the population of the Vancouver area). I wouldn't put it past them.   And my final comment on this topic: credit cards.  urlLink This article  on how Koreans were lured by the notion of 'easy money/credit' (fanned somewhat by the card companies' desire for market share at any cost) and hwo it almost lead to suicide for these three individuals (sadly, many of also 'succeeded' in passing on their debts to their heirs, as happens here when a debtor dies).
urlLink As promised yesterday , last night I saw a Korean horror movie:  urlLink ë¶ì ì¬ë°/Bunshinsaba .  First, though, there was time to kill before the movie so a little sam-gyup-sal was in order. We went to Don Don Restaurant in Jong-no (downtown) where there was an interesting concept. It's on the fourth floor and is entirely open-air...but they still had fans and air conditioners on full blast, too. Also, the condiments (ìì¥/ssam-jang or bean paste, ìì¶/sang-choo or lettuce, ë¯¸ì­êµ­/mi-yok-gook or kelp soup and other goodies that are hand-delivered in most restaurants were self-service after the initial place-setting. This was cool for me as (i) I love ìì¥ and ìì¶ with my pork and (ii) we were seated  right  next to the buffet. They also cut the pork right in front of you (Koreans are always trying to differentiate themselves, especially regarding food). Trouble is, it kinda reminded me of  urlLink Lorena Bobbit ...dooough!  Next stop was ice cream at LG25 (LG's answer to 7-11...is it really open 25 hours a day?) and try my hand at shooting a Gatling gun. Not a real one, mind you, it shoots pellets. (I'd like to see how my G.I. buddies do at that one.) Of course, the place was staffed by 2 little Korean gals (all the better to lure in the men), one of which was a pretty good shot with the Beretta.   urlLink     Cutting the Pig; Shooting the Gatling; Scaring the Girls   They say that fear for Koreans is different from us Westerners ( urlLink see article ) but I think it had many similarities to the Western genre...although the setting and plot was a little different. I won't reveal too much, but let's just say that the director did a good job of creating a lot of suspense and fright in that theatre. There was one gal there who went just berserk at about every scary scene (especially in the beginning) and everyone laughed after each outburst. I think she was scared enough for the whole room. Hahaha. Just hilarious. Without that comic relief it would have been a lot scarier, I think.   urlLink     Scenes from the movie...walking...a hand...raising her face (!)...then the final scene...and afterward.   Some pics above from the film--sorry, figured out my zoom after the first couple, and the lighting, as you might imagine, was not optimal. The effects were minimal compared to I, Robot but very, very effective for this movie. Afterward I took a picture of a lighted billboard. The girl in the white dress wasn't there when I took it...she must be a ghost! Ok, that's a joke, but it sure sounds scary. í¸ííí!
I came across this in my daily readings of Korean news and sites...just trying to get a handle on this place.   urlLink     The anti-traditional Korean lady...holy crap, they look strong!  And push-ups!   More pics on  urlLink the site  (it's all in Korean, but no translation needed for the images.  Now, I knew that Korean women are strong in spirit, but had not seen many like this.  Most Korean men like their gals to be smaller, weaker (well, most guys do, it's just more prevalent here) so it takes real...um....balls for a gal to go into this sport.  I don't mind it, myself.  Maybe because even when muscle-bound Korean women still look relatively dainty--at least compared to their Western-lady body-building counterparts who start to look a little horsey.
Seoul is a pretty good place for outdoor activities, as long as you live in the right part of town (which I do, thank you!). There are a few parks around but 2 of the largest are Olympic Park (a massive place that I lived near for 6 months when I stayed with my in-laws when I first came here...they were right in the '88 Olympic Village, which was nice) and Yeouido Park (which was like a parking lot before they revamped it and added trees and stuff).   urlLink     View of Yeouido Core; the park at 6AM one Spring morning...gorgeous; The Great King Sejong; and, to top it off, a guy sleeping in a gazebo.   Take a look at the scene above...this is like a block from my home and work. Before the office moved to this side of the park these views were my commute everyday...a 12 minute walk from door-to-door. Pretty cool, eh? Sure it costs a bit more to live in Yeouido and there isn't a Lotte Mart (Korean Wal-Mart) to be found in the immediate area, but it's real nice here, I think.  urlLink The Great King Sejong  is credited with 'inventing', or at least causing the invention of, Hanguel (the Korean alphabet, although it's not really an alphabet, it's more a set of sounds put to writing...very scientific for back then). His name and image is all over the place, especially at schools. There is also a  urlLink book store  and  urlLink securities company  named after him. And what stroll in Seoul would be complete without seeing a guy sleeping on the ground or floor (as reported before a few times). This guy looks prepared, though. He had the presence of mind to bring a mummy sleeping bag and get himself in the gazebo (and away from the early-morning dew that is so prominent here in the Spring).  For exercise, the little that I do here, I like to inline skate (as they call rollerblading here). Take a look at these shots:   urlLink     LG Twins Building, 63 Building, and Traffic!   Here's the lovely LG Twins Building (owned by LG Group, formerly Lucky Goldstar, also owner of the LG Twins baseball team; there are rumored to be anti-aircraft guns on the top of these towers to help defend Seoul); the 63-story tall &#50977;&#49340;&#48716;&#46377; (yook-sam (6-3) bill-ding) which houses &#45824;&#54620;&#49373;&#47749; (dae-han-seng-myung, Korea Life (Insurance), aka KLI by foreigners); and a couple views of how close you can get to the traffic on this path. It actually goes under the 88 (&#54036;&#54036;/pal-pal) Highway for a ways. Ya, probably not the cleanest place to workout, but it's all we got without going 1-2 hours from here. Many people actually drive 30-60 minutes to get to  here , especially on the weekends and holidays when this place is a madhouse. On Children's Day I got a groin injury from dragging my skate so much in order to slow down for the (literally) thousands of kids on the paths.  And why exercise?  Well, there are a lot of fun places in Seoul such as Bricx (click  urlLink here  to see the Playboy Party pics...man, think I have to check this place out; wet T-shirts involved, no minors) and good ol' Ohoo/Hodge Podge (some crowd pics  urlLink here ).  More tomorrow...going to see a  urlLink Korean horror movie  tonight (with subtitles), should be interesting.
Man, how do I come across some of this stuff. Anyways, there are a couple things that may help get my buds over to Seoul sometime soon (you know who you are). Many have threatened to come here, and some read my blog and may be on the verge, but this should about do it.  Here it is:  urlLink Seoul, home of the sexiest women on the planet . (Not that they have a chance at meeting them, but they are in the city limits, apparently.)  There's also the interesting theme parties they have at  urlLink Bricx Bar  in Itaewon. I've still never been to one, but the last one ( urlLink the Bikini Party ) almost got me there. The next one is a Jungle theme. Unga-bunga!   urlLink     Ok, she's not Korean...she may not even be in Seoul...but it's a mighty fine pic.   Of course if you do hook up with a Korean (especially a Korean gal) you may find yourself a victim of 'the Coupling'. I've heard it's only with married couples, but I suspect that boyfriends get roped into this look as well. Watch out.   urlLink     Beware 'the Coupling'.
&#49888;&#52492; (Sinchon, an area of Seoul near &#54861;&#45824;/HongDae, or the university district) is a pretty cool place.  From Yeouido the subway is pretty inconvenient, but there's is a bus that goes there and cabs are a cheap and fast option as well.  A few times, though, especially in this warm weather, I couldn't ignore the urge to walk the 45 minutes it takes to get there/home.  It's a nice walk: flat, across a bridge (usually some nice breezes blowing by) and you get to see more of the city and its people that way.   urlLink     Smoggy view; 2 black swans; impenetrable lock; stinky garbage (peeee-yew!)   The pics above are from a recent walk.  The first is a lovely view of Seoul's smog.  This is easterly; to the west the sky was clean (owing to the west-to-east winds from the West Sea) but it was too bright to take a picture of.  Below the bridge, and fairly numerous along the Hangang (Han River) are &#48177;&#51312; (swan) boats.  People paddle around in these things, but not too often.  (The mascot of Mapo-Gu, where Sinchon-dong is, is a swan; Youngdeungpo-ku, where Yeouido-dong is, has a duck sporting a necktie as its emblem.)  In the summer months people even sleep next to the river (well, not  right  next to it) fishing, eating ramen, drinking soju, talking...typical Korean stuff.  The odd spiral pic is that of a 'lock' on a gate next to a dilapidated apartment building.  You can see that not only is it easy to open, but the material is nothing more than thin wire.  I have no idea what or who this is supposed to guard against, but I guess someone had a reason for putting it there.  While walking back home I smelled something pretty putrid.  I mean really rotten.  God-awful, it was.  Then I stumbled upon the answer (thankfully not literally), this pile of decomposing trash.  Where's a garbage truck when you need one? Actually, I take that back.  Once in Daehang-ro a garbage truck passed by and let me tell you the smell emanating from that thing was 100 times worse than a few bags on the street.  Worst thing was, it came toward us and it left a lovely stench-ridden trail of liquid behind it...fantastic if you're walking that way.  I guess that's why the trash-heaver was running so fast beside the truck--he wanted to stay ahead of the reek.  Anyways, yesterday night my friend Andrea's friend Travis came to Seoul with his Korean bride-to-be, &#54788;&#51221;/Hyun Jeong.  We went to a Korean tuna restaurant, then to 'my' Outsider (where he tried  James Dr. Pepper : 1/2 pint beer, 1/2 pint Coke, 1 shot Amaretto dropped in and downed in 'one shot!') and then it was off to Sinchon for &#49328;&#45209;&#51648; (san-nak-ji, living octopus) and &#49436;&#54588;&#46041;&#54028; (seo-pi-dong-pa, a mix of western pizza and Korean pajun/omlette) alone with &#49548;&#51452;/soju and &#46041;&#46041;&#51452;/dongdongju (literally comes from the fermentation process where dongdongju settles to the bottom of the vat and is separated from a clear moonshine-like alcohol by a thin layer of rice).  Let's just say that we had a pretty good time and Travis did quite well for a guy who doesn't drink too much: not even a hangover the next morning. But then, we got home pretty early, at about midnight; on a weekend we'd likely had been out til 4 or 6 or 8 in the morning.
Forgot I had this in my phone/camera.  Actually got a series going of this dude at one of these dance video games.  Think I remember seeing them in Vancouver too, but this ones is not just feet but arms.  There are lasers or something that sense where and how he moves his arms and if it's in sync with the instructions/music.  The guy was pretty thin and the moves made him look quite gay.  I wonder if he does these kinds of actions on the dancefloor...I wouldn't if I were him, the gals in the arcade/gameroom were really laughing it up (good thing the music was really loud).   urlLink     If this guy's got all the moves why are the girls laughing so hard??
There are a few ways to beat the heat here in Seoul. One is to simply stay at work, but with the government-imposed  urlLink 5-day work-week  coming into effect (and since I can't really figure out why I'd work 7 days a week) that isn't a very viable option. You could go to the beach, but it tends to get a little crowded (as  urlLink this story  attests). Or, you can go see movies. If you do, though, as I noted in a  urlLink past blog , get ready for some comedy--and I mean before the movie starts. One of my favorite theatres is the brand-new Fantaseum in Daehangro. The staff there have some pretty wild costumes. There is a Chipper's restaurant on the top 2 floors too (where apparently the food isn't so hot, but there's a magic show to extertain the kids). The Chipper's staff (even the guys) have aprons and lace collars on their uniforms, and the female theatre staff have, get this, wings. Ya, they're dressed as angels. See pics.   urlLink     Angels complete with wings and Squid...the whole squid   They also all have this cute (well, hilarious is more appropriate) little salute they do when they greet you and say good-bye. They put their left hand on their hip, their right hand up (as if they're swearing on a bible) and touch their fingertips together while at the same time bending their knees. All this they do with a smile on their face. (If you don't get my description, think of a gay Nazi doing a Heil Hitler and you'll be pretty close.) Man, the things people do for part-time work.  Oh ya, the squid is there for general interest. It's restaurant display. I've seen dishes with hacked-up squid in it, but not one with (what looks like at least) a whole squid on the plate. Interesting.  Anyhoo, this weekend I saw 3 movies...one Korean and two Western ones (not spaghetti Westerns, just non-Korean/foreign). The Korean one was  urlLink (íëë¤ì ëì)ëª©í¬ëí­êµ¬ë¤  (Hyung-nim-deul-ui do-shi mok-po-neun-hang-goo-da, or Mok-po: Gangster's Paradise). It was a pretty entertaining film, although some Korean humor I'm still trying to figure out. It goes from serious to amusing to gross in like 3 frames. One scene is with these 3 minor gangsters who are so poor they have to eat dogfood, but it gives them the runs and later (when you least expect it) a serious scene cuts to them running into a single-stall public loo. Well, the senior guy goes in and prepares to blast-off (so to speak) but the seatcover falls and he lets loose on it instead of into the bowl. They show you the mess oozing from between the cover and his legs and even outside the stall where it envelopes the (bare, for some reason) foot of his junior. My God, is there anything more repugnant? These guys were kind of a show-stealer (or a party-pooper, depending on your viewpoint).   urlLink     Mokpo, Gangster's Paradise; King Arthur; I, Robot    urlLink King Arthur  was...ok. Lots of action and killing and Braveheart-like speeches, but I can only give it a 3 or 3.5 out of 5. If you've seen Lord of the Rings this one will seem kinda washed out.  I did, however, find that one of the characters, Bors, to be much like my bud from Manchester, Alex. He also resembled Alex's business partner, Mark, but I met Alex first so he gets top billing. Reading about  urlLink the actor, Ray Winstone,  I learned that the character was much like the actor and both were like Alex. Life imitating art imitating life?   urlLink     Alex Bors and Mark...which is which?   I, Robot was pretty cool. I think I may have read part of the book way back in high school (geek that I was/am). The movie had a TON of special effects in it, but (seeing as it was in the future) they all made sense. Things, for some reason, didn't seem over the top, but that may be because I've been desensitized by now. I, Robot gets a 4 out of 5...or, for those out there who are not into sci-fi, a 3 out of 5....hey, Will Smith is in it! Oh, and the naked butt scenes are equal opportunity: one of Will (but I closed my eyes for that one), one of the girl (but I told my wife I closed my eyes for  that  one).  Well, that's it...a pretty boring weekend, for once. Actually got all the sleep I needed for once. I'm sure I won't make that mistake again for a long time.
Ok, it's not at all scientific. I was just taking a look through my millions of jpegs and such and found these two to be, well, eerily similar.   urlLink     DPRK's Kim Jong-il and U2's Bono   Is it me? Or does  urlLink North Korea 's (Democratic People's Republic of Korea/DPRK) 'Dear Leader' look at least a bit like  urlLink U2 's Bono? Of course they have some pretty different ideas about human rights and the environment but I get the feeling that being in the public eye for so long, the throngs of adoring fans (well, in Kim's case adoring may be a stretch) and accompanying entourage/roadies may have made them both a little distant from work-a-day realities. At least Bono doesn't require visitors to put  urlLink flowers at the foot of massive statues of his father , though.   urlLink Here's an interesting story  that's sure to attract an obliquely-worded press release from the North.
Just in time for Mel Gibson's  urlLink The Paparazzi  movie, here is a candid shot of Tommy from  urlLink &#54616;&#45208;&#46168;&#49483;/hana-dool-set  (1-2-3) fame!   urlLink     It's Tommy!   Actually, he's on the snippet-show  urlLink 'Wake-up'  where he and a Korean girl (and a lovable muppet-like friend) say simple phrases again and again and again...all to the same music everytime. ('I'm hot...I'm hot...I'm cold...I'm cold...I'm hhhhoooottt...I'm cccooooolllld') I tape it every morning for my kids back home and try to learn a bit of Korean...everyone speaks so (relatively) slowly on the show and uses simple tenses, which is good for us gringos.  It was pretty funny seeing him...it was at Starbucks in Sinchon and I immediately recognized him (well, seeing him everyday with his two-tone hair makes him an easy mark). I was waiting for a bud and he was with a gal so I didn't intrude...but I did intrude enough to take this pic. I was going to approach him, but then I thought it weird to act like a fan for a guy who's on a kid's simple English program; but I'm sure if my friend showed up before he left I'd have done something. I'll probably hear from his lawyers soon anyways, on account of the pic. It's tough to make out that it's actually him, so I doubt any of the local rags would give me much for it...there goes my dream of paying for my trip home with a snapshot.  It's weird, you know. There are so many celebrities in Seoul (especially in Yeouido, as the  urlLink MBC  and  urlLink KBS  broadcasting firms are located here). When I went to that  urlLink party after the MTV concert  my friends said they saw lots of 'talents' (singers, comedians, actors, anyone in the limelight) but I hadn't a clue who they were.  One time I was in the gym with my &#51109;&#51064;&#50612;&#47480;/jang-ee-neo-ruen/father-in-law and he introduced me to this guy while we were in the shower...he looked quite familiar but given the surroundings I couldn't quite place him. Then I got it...he was the anchorman from KBS news (now he's the Washington DC correspondent). There's also a popular comic performing in a bar in Yeouido (I think he's a part-owner of the place) but I had no idea until my junior from work told me (he got his autograph, too).  On another unrelated topic:  urlLink remember when I said that foreigners are buying up Korean companies?  Well,  urlLink looks like they've bought about 44%  (!) of the stocks on the Korean Stock Exchange. Wow, can you say takeover? What would happen if Americans bought large swathes of Canadian companies? Oh, ya, they already have. Anyways, some Koreans are calling foul (forgetting that you can't have capitalism without capital. The craziest idea is the one to levy a tax on the investing funds...ya, right...as soon as that gets serious many foreigners'll just sell pre-emptively and pull the rug out from many of the firms (not to mention the economy) here. Of course there'd be calls to prohibit capital from leaving Korea (as there was in the Park Chung Hee era (1961-1979) when emigrants could only take about $20 with them when they left the country--although I'm sure that didn't apply to government-types). That kind of thinking would put Korea about 10-20 back from where it is (which is, in many areas, 5-15 years back from the West).  That was close, almost sounded political there. Just so you know, I don't make this blog a sounding board for my political views, however when it comes to economics and business I think I have a relatively educated and experienced opinion...so be prepared to be bored (or aroused, depending on your view of the dismal science) every once in a while.
Man, with all that is going on I can see my posting to the ol' blog getting bogged down the next couple of week.  Got a ton of stuff to do at work as well as the trip (at which time I'll be in full-Daddy mode for the duration) which means precious little time to blog.  Well, we'll see how much I can relate to you from Canada.  In the meantime, take a look at  urlLink Shawn's blog .  He's got some funny stuff to say usually, although lately he's been a little infatuated with taking pictures of his chubby bod (for those of you who know...we have similar body types).  Later.
Korea's pretty funny sometimes.  Take a look at  urlLink this article  about changing the age of majority from 20 (already a year younger than the U.S.) to 19 (the same as British Columbia, Canada, but higher than the 18 that is prevalen federally and in some Canadian provinces).  Here parents are commenting on the ability to take on rights and responsibilities at the tender age of 19.   'My boy is almost an adult now and the law now even considers him a man, but he has to learn his responsibilities and accept his own choices in life,' Han Ho-sun, mother of a 20-year-old, said. 'But what does he know? He is not ready to make decisions as an adult yet. And if he is granted too much freedom, I'm worried he'll get himself into trouble.'   Other parents of young adults agreed. They nodded their heads to the idea that the government, before lowering the adult age, should provide training and programs to teach what adult responsibilities entail - such as building up a good credit record, making political decisions and getting married.   ' What? 19 years? Kids that age aren't really mature enough to handle anything! Let alone complete adulthood,'  said one parent who asked for anonymity.   The first two seem pretty sensible, but the last one (if the name wasn't withheld) would be prime fodder for the  urlLink Tonight Show's Headlines  segment, I think.  Then there's  urlLink this article  about the capture of an ex-convict suspected of stabbing to death two police offices a few days ago.  This part deserves special attention:   As police raided the house,  Lee injured himself by stabbing his abdomen and thighs several times  while holding a child and a 48-year-old woman as hostages to resist arrest.  He was immediately sent to Ehwa Womans University Mok-dong Hospital for emergency treatment...  What?  Did I just read that right?  The suspect stabbed  himself  enough to need to go to the emergency room?  What was he trying to do?  Commit suicide so as to evade capture?!??!  Methink perhaps the (can I say vengeful?) police on the scene may have helped him guide the knife  just a bit . Maybe he did stab himself, but it sure seems weird.   urlLink Here's an op/ed  on the capture and how it was handled by the police.
Ya, I'm off to Canada/Vancouver again soon...ah, to be back in the land of fresh air, real mountains and diapers. Luckily, I think my oldest boy is out potty-trained now. Not sure, though, haven't been home for about 2 months...and a lot can happen in that time.  Now that we've done a deal here my boss/CEO would have me here all of August (well, all of the year, actually) but I have to go back as it's my younger son's first birthday, or  urlLink ì²«ë/Chot-dol  (they have a different name for almost everything here). For Koreans the 1st and 60th birthdays are the biggies. 1st because the child made it through the often-treacherous first year (remember, Korea used to be really, really poor...so much so that is was a 100-days celebration as well, but that is starting to become less important as more babies are living past it). 60th because the  urlLink Korean Zodiac  is similar to the Chinese one...with 12 animals (ya, I'm a pig). There are also five colors which elude me at the moment, although I know two of them are black and gold. The Chinese use five elements: metal, earth, wood, fire and water. This year is  urlLink Year of the Wood Monkey , which I guess is better than 1981... urlLink Year of the Wood Cock/Rooster . (Hehe, had to put that in there.) Anyways, at age 60 you've gone through all 12 years 5 times for each of the colors/elements...a truly magical time, I guess. Thus, by age 60 men (no mention of women) should have at least one grandchild, preferably a grandSON--one more reason to be happy that we had our oldest boy in my wife's father's 60th year!  Now about foreingers (as I/we call all non-Koreans...even in Canada for some reason). Korea ain't called  urlLink The Hermit Kingdom  for nothin'. Basically, there are very, very few foreigners here. Something like 200,000 in a country of 48 Million. Most of us are (like me) in Seoul and (not like me) teachers. Others are manual labour workers from China, India and Southeast Asia (doing the  urlLink 3D-dirty, dangerous, difficult-jobs  that Koreans feel they no longer need to perform en mass).  Foreigners (or ì¸êµ­ì¸/weigook-in or ì¸êµ­ì¬ë/weigook-saram) are treated quite differently from native Koreans (and likely for good reason in some cases). We all need to register with our local êµ¬/ku (ward/borough) office and do so (i) every 12 months or (ii) if we move to another êµ¬ (whichever comes first). We get an Alien Registration Card that has our pic and address on it as well as our visa type (teachers are E-2, I fall under E-7 or 'other worker, director'). We need the ARC to get a job, get a bank account or do almost everything else official here. But it's not the same as a Korean Citizenship Card. Some promotions, for example the bonus card for  urlLink Fantaseum , is only for Koreans, not me. So I can't get 10% off movies or get bonus points there...waaaaaaaaa!  Also,  urlLink foreigners cannot easily buy land in Korea  (although I've also heard that it just can't be done...not sure who to believe on this).  urlLink Foreign investment companies, however, still did so --and did in great amounts after the 1997 financial crisis. (In fact, they were the first firms in Korea to EVER use due diligence/research before buying and developing land...Korean execs, it seems, did it based more on intuition than anything else before then.)  It's also hard for foreign firms to get market share here--unless they partner with a local firm such as Otis did with LG Group concerning elevators and escalators. Heck, foreign car makers have just  urlLink 3% of the local market ! (Not counting GM's recent purchase of Daewoo Motors, which is a small player anyways.)  One thing foreigners have had some success in doing is buying all or parts of troubled Korean companies. Korean firms put off foreign investment as long as possible, but in the end they  can  take on foreign investors-- urlLink ëíìëª/DaeHan sengmyung/Life aka Korea Life Insurance  is 5% owned by Australia's largest bank,  urlLink Macquarie Bank . Korean firms, however are loathe, it seems, to disclose what most purchasers would consider to be important facts about the businesses.  urlLink êµë³´ìëª/Kyobo Sengmyung/Life  apparently had months of due diligence done on it by  urlLink buyout firms , but in the end not enough was known to do a deal. Foreign firms have been able to  urlLink buy billions of USD in Korean stocks ,  urlLink SK Life ,  urlLink large portions of Korean banks ,  urlLink other firms  and one ( urlLink PCA ) is  urlLink in the running  to buy  urlLink ëíí¬ìì¦ê¶/DaeHan Tooja Jeunkwon/DaeHan ITC/Investment Trust Company aka Daetoo  (names here can get pretty long and complicated) though, so there is some opening up of this place.  Funny, the longer I'm here, the more normal all of this seems...not sure that is a good thing.
Ah, finally...someone else I know is coming here from Canada for a visit. First was my cousin, Lars in May of 2003. He came at the perfect time. Weather was getting warm, but not unbearably hot and  urlLink Children's Day and Buddha's Birthday  were celebrated (day off) during his time here too. That was cool. Here are some pics from his visit. We did almost everything you could as a tourist for a short visit (but light on the bar scene as I was not as educated as I am now on it...and he was so young and impressionable at the time).   urlLink       Welcome to Korea...you must have SARS; Seoul City Hall traffic square;  urlLink Myoungdong  on the weekend; kids and wooden swords @ Korean Heritage Museum; us at the  urlLink Korean Folk Village ; on  urlLink the bus  heading to  urlLink Incheon Airport .   He had a fever (from a normal cold) a few days before he got here, so that and the general lack on English language ability by almost everyone here lead him to be delayed getting out of the airport by over an hour. Next time I'll give my visitors a little note in Korean to show the airport staff saying: 'I'm a top gamer from _______ please make sure I don't miss my tournament and speed me through customs quickly.' or some such thing--Koreans love their online games here; they even have a TV station dedicated to it.  Lars had this to report about Korea (and he's flown about 1,000,000 miles thus far): it's similar to Europe, but just LOTS more people.  The second person was a guy I met through a teacher in  urlLink Pusan/Busan  I know through a friend of mine in  urlLink Nanaimo  (my old roommate, actually; funny how things seem to dovetail as we get on in years). Anyways, her sister's bud is getting married to a gal in  urlLink Taegu/Daegu  and wanted some pointers on how to not screw-up in front of the in-laws-to-be. He was here for a week or so and in Seoul for a couple of days...but I think  urlLink we crammed a week of drinking into one night .   urlLink Yusheng  should have a good time here and should be here sometime in the fall, date to be determined. The guy's some kinda world traveler and he takes  urlLink some pretty cool pic of architecture  wherever he goes. I've noticed that many of them are devoid of human presence...something he'd be challenged to do in Seoul. There's always people around you here no matter the time or place. If you want to see some cool shots of my other hometown, Vancouver, take a look  urlLink here .  Ok, time to get my  urlLink pubmaps  out and plan Yusheng's course.
I think if I'm going to claim ì¬ìë/Yeouido as my new hometown I should know something about it...and by extension you should too. I've got a little more to add to my  urlLink background on it thus far .  As you may know, ~do can mean two things in Korean. One is: province, such as ê²½ê¸°ë/Kyunggi-do. The other is island, such as ì ì£¼ë/Jeju-do (also spelled Cheju-do, depending on what era the map or publication was edited in...things changed in 2002, just in time to confuse the heck out of tourists coming here for the World Cup). Since Yeouido (also spelled Youido, Yoido and Yeoido) is pretty tiny and part of ìë±í¬êµ¬/Youngdeungpo-ku (ku is like a ward or borough such as Queen's or The Bronx) the ~do here signifies that it's an island. I had no idea that its ~do was 'island' because it looks as though they've filled in or paved over much of the water that once separated Yeouido from the mainland.  Anyways, way back when Yeouido used to be on the outskirts of Seoul and it housed the countries first real airport. (Later  urlLink Gimpo/Kimpo Airport  was built in the new outskirts of Seoul and now, since the city is not getting any smaller,  urlLink Incheon Airport  is the new International airport for Seoul; although Kimpo still handles much of the domestic traffic.) In fact,  urlLink Yeouido Park , which until 1996 or so was a slab of pavement instead of the picturesque park that it is, was the runway of that airport! So, here in West Yeouido, near the park, is where the streets are named ìë§ì°/Yang-mal-san or 'sock mountain'. I got to thinking why it would be called sock mountain...there wasn't a sock factory here to my knowledge and I hadn't heard a story about removing one's socks for any reason (although I wouldn't dismiss it if I heard it; there are so many different traditions here). When I heard about the airport I came up with this theory: sock mountain is the hill (here they call a mountain what we in Vancouver would call a knoll, I find) where  urlLink the windsock  was placed. Make sense?  For more exciting and ground-breaking news stay tuned to this blog.
Being gay in Korea is like being gay in the U.S. military...in 1950. Let's just say that it's not near as lovingly embraced as in the West/US. Gays marrying in Korea? C'mon! There are no Korean gays! Of course, if one is gay one can hardly be Korean. I'm not trying to piss of PCers out there, this is just the way many Koreans (especially men and older ones) think. Although the younger generation are more open to other ideas, it's the older generation that controls politics, education, finance, and even media and culture to a large degree. The CEOs of the TV stations are all men and all old guys, as an example.  Things are changing, though, as evidenced in this poster for a gay bar in Itaewon. (Now that you know its name you can either (i) know where to go or (ii) know where to avoid depending on your preference.)   urlLink     Yikes!   Here are a few websites on gays in Korea:  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  urlLink This blog  has a tongue-in-cheek explanation of what being gay is...basically a primer in ' urlLink gaydar ' (how to recognize a gay in Korea or elsewhere). However, I think that many of the guys here have gay characteristics. It's pretty weird sometimes. In a business meeting one guy from a partner firm put his hand on my leg (just above the knee) as he spoke of my experience in finance and what I do for the investment process. This would be outrightly gay, but in Korea it's ok...it just shows (non-sexual) fondness and a measure of trust between two people. My boss does it also...much to the surprise of foreigners in our group...but, again, it's not 'gay' its just the culture here. My wife's uncle holds my hand, too...and not for 2-3 seconds; for 2-3 minutes. At first I thought it was pretty weird, but it just means that he really likes me. (Having said all this I know I'll have to put up with a deluge of gay jokes when I see my buds back in Canada, crap.)  Over here guys touch guys and girls touch girls, but it's just not sexual. Many young gals (especially) can be seen holding hands while walking down the road. Add to that the schoolgirl uniform and you have a formula for stimulation for most Western guys. You get used to it, though.  I really wonder about some of these Korean guys, though.  urlLink The Face Shop  has a model on all of their (make-up) stores that's pretty gay looking. There are others as well. These guys are (I hope) more  urlLink metrosexual  than homosexual, although the distinction is greying. Many of the boy bands have similar dudes in them-the clothes, the hair, the dance moves. I got to really wonder sometimes. (Remember  urlLink this guy? )  Perhaps because of the stigma attached to being gay in Korea most gays don't come out of the closet--choosing instead to marry, have kids and be a 'normal' person or going into singing or acting or modeling and making the excuse that they're too busy with their career to find a wife. Either way, it's quite different from in the West where there is more acceptance of such things.  On another topic: yesterday I had lunch with my CEO/boss and he mentioned that China and Korea were having a  urlLink tiff about the Gorguyeo Dynasty . He said, 'oh, how can you know about that...it is just Korean history'. Well, when I said that is was about 50AD-600AD and was concurrent with the Paekche and Shilla empires and before the United Shilla dynasty that preceded the closely-named Koryo Dynasty of about 1100-1300AD that was right before the venerated Chosun Dynasty of 1392-1910 he just looked at me. Not sure if he got all of what I said, but a colleague dining with us said that I do, in fact, know about Korean history...hey, I've been here almost 2 years-and not all of it has been in the bars. My dates of Koryo are a little off, but if you want more information of where Korea came from take a look at  urlLink this site . It has a cool timeline...just right if you're writing a report! So, if you're speaking with a Korean don't be surprised if they assume that since you're a foreigner you  can't  know precisely anything about Korea--and if you do know some facts or stories from its history you can really impress them well here.  Oh, and just for the record:  I'm not gay.
O= optimist P= pessimist  My argument with myself:  P: Nooooo! Stop thinking about him! O: Why? He's my boyfriend. I'm allowed to. P: You're obsessing! O: What?! No I'm not. I just like him a lot. P: You're crazy if you think it's going to work! O: Ok... Then I'm crazy! P: So you think it will work out between you two? Do you think he's 'the one'? O: Yes and possibly. P: Insane! I can't believe you! You know what is going to happen! The same thing that always happens. You will get your hopes up and then He will drop you flat on your face! O: He would never do that! Not in a million years! P: What makes you think that? O: He's different. P: How so? Every guy you've ever met has hurt you in some way, and he is a guy... Right? O: Of course he is a guy! P: So how do you know HE won't break your heart too. O: I just know. P: Oh my gosh! I don't know why you are doing this to yourself again!
Look at me. Look at my eyes. You see a tear. Now look into my eyes as I gaze aimlessly into yours. Grief, hope, anguish, love. I know you can see it all. We lock each other in a stare, trying to freeze us in this moment. A conversation passes between us, but no words are spoken. Unsure of what to do next, I run my fingers through your hair. Then we hug. This position once so odd now becomes the most comforting thing in my entire world. Then the bell rings. Yes... the bell. Once it was my savior and now I am betrayed by the bell. We stand hand in hand as the world goes on around us. I tell you I love you. You say it back. I weekly say good-bye. I walk away, only twenty steps away. I look back to see you watching me... A fading memory. I run back and kiss you. A perpetual kiss. When we part and walk away, the warmth remains on our lips. You take with you a huge part of my life. Not only do you have my entire heart, you have my first kiss too. Remember me fondly forever, because I will never forget you. I love you. Good-bye.
I walk into the only entrance of my prison. School once was my escape, but now my confinement. We are but ruthless animals in a cage. The rules here are almost amusing. No permanent marker, no writing on clothing, no cameras. So for these last few days of Jr. High we can't take pictures!? Outrageous! Am I supposed to remember everything? I have no clear images of these last moments with my dearest friends. Just foggy memories continuously fading. We have virtually three days left of school and NOW the teachers are piling stuff on us. Finals one after another. Last minute projects are popping out of nowhere! But on to of that, we have to deal with the pain of saying good-bye. I'm not even strong enough to face one of those problems by myself, let alone all of them. Prison.
Why do I like him? He's funny We have so much in common He is so cute We have the same sick mind He likes friends (I know huh!) Unlike other guys he can actually match He is super sweet Never is he mad He is intelligent He is open, almost... ok he's blunt He is witty He is NOT gay (see, not all the good ones are) And yes ladys, he is real... and taken.  I dunno why he's with me. I didn't think he'd like a girl, well... like me. I mean, I'm  Not to bright(I almost get streight Fs) I'm fat I'm ugly I'm a bitch sometimes I'm clinicly insane (no... realy) That seems like a lot to deal with, don't you think? I don't know what the boy sees in me. But this is like a dream come true. Every girl dreams that some day the perfect guy will show up one day, even a girl like me. Well, mericals do happen. I guess there's hope after all. Even for a girl like me.
I've fallen so deep, so fast. I don't know what to do with myself. But I know I feel so good. I love to look at him, listen to the voice of the Aries. I wish I had the courage to go up to him and kiss him. I want to, but yet fade away into the shadows of fear and questioning. Dose Aries like me? How can I tell? What if he doesn't and I'm making a fool of myself, stumbling over my feelings. A little girl with a crush just out of her reach. What if he dose like me too? If he asks me out do I say yes? Of course I do! Even though we will not see eachother as much as we'd like, who says it cant work! Right...? But what if it won't work... I guess we'll have to find out...
It's hard to think that we have less than a week together. Then, it's over. Most of my friends will fly away together leaving me without wings... aimlessly hobbling around trying to find replacement wings and friends. I almost don't want to go to school. I don't want to say good bye. We can say we'll be friends forever, but the truth is, no matter how much you hate to admitt it, people grow appart. High School is the hardest most crusal part of anyone's life, and I'm left to face it without my sheild, my crutches, my wings. I'm alone. Clanless. Friendless. As every body stands up in High School, still hand in hand walking together, helping eachother; I wander, holding my own hand, being crushed and stepped on by the clans of friends. That's me. Flattend to the ground. The loner. No friends, no passion, no will to live. I'm starting over. Never have I stayed in one school for more than two years... never. So every other year I am forced to start over. This is like the others, but different. This is more important to me than anything else. I can't start over again. Mabey I'll be invisable, never get into another relationship again. I know it will just shatter like the rest. I can't stand to be hurt one more time. I can't pick up the shards of my broken heart alone anymore. But I have no choice. Some people say 'The future depends on you', but really you depend on the future. So I'm depending on the future... that tomarrow will be a better day. I will be optomistic and spend as much time as I can with my friends, for I only have a short time with them. Untill June 9th, 2004, 3:20pm: Then it's...   Good Bye.  >
Stroke my face that's resting on your lap. Tell me it'll be ok. Tell me we will be together forever. Tell me you love me, you'll never forget me. We'll still see each other all the time. Nothing will change. Look into my eyes with your sympathetic eyes. Everything will be alright.  No! Stop! You're lieing! I'll never see you again! Everything will be different! You don't love me! You won't returne my calls! You'll forget my name! Stop!  Go back to the week before, we are all together in Washington D.C. Now back to reality. We are drifting away. You are together, I am alone. Stroke my face that's resting on your lap. I'm crying. Tell me it's ok to cry. You're crying too. Hug me. Please dont hurt me. I love you. It'll be ok.
You may be wondering why my site is called 'Spaghetti Wall'. It is a joke between me and some friends. We went on the Washington D.C. trip with my school. We were at a nice Italian restraunt and I got plain spaghetti noodles. One of my friends pointed out that if the noodles were cooked, they'd stick to the wall. She grabbed a handful and sure enough, the spaghetti stuck to the wall! For some reason, I couldn't pick the noodles off the wall with my fingers. I couldn't get a hold of them. What else could I do? I ate the spaghetti of the wall! Everybody though it was so funny!  Do you remember the 'Spaghetti Wall'?
I walk into a life long summer  memory that I havenât seen for two years. Everything is so familiar. The buildings, the people, even the attitude of the whole place are the same. I love the fact that year after year I can depend on it to be itâs old comforting place. I feel like Iâm in a dream. I know every face I see, even the parents, but I fear they donât remember me. I fear Iâm just a confusingly familiar face. Iâve changed so much from last time theyâve seen me up till now. I wonder if they can see that. I am curious to find out if how I am now will effect the way I function in this place differently than before. I walk into this life long summer memory, fading into a new reality.
Itâs amazing really. Youâve been through every season of my sole, and you still love me. You have always been there for me. Youâve never backed away, no matter how unbearable the weather was. Itâs hard to find people loyal enough to go through with that. Iâm just lucky I guess.  THE SEASONS OF MY SOLE: Summer~ when everything is doing well. My life is going smoothly. No bumps in the road.  Fall~ when my colors fall off. My life falls apart. Unlike a leaf, I donât float down, I crash down hard.  Winter~ when the rain starts to fall. My life is completely torn to peaces. I am bare. Winter is the harshest of all seasons. An emotional blizzard.  Spring~ when my life starts anew. I gather myself, and often use you for support (Iâm very weak at this point). My life begins to blossom.
I work at a day camp full of little kids. You wouldnât believe the stories Iâve heard from these kids! Iâve heard that someone could detach his head and still live âfor realsâ. This one kid was born with flames painted on his fingernails! Itâs amazing how many kids still fall for the âdetaching fingerâ trick. Itâs interesting to think that to them, this is all so real. While to us it all seems so fake and ignorant. Iâm beginning to wonder if what seems to be reality to me is as fake to someone else as those kidsâ to me. What if what they believe is real is the actual reality, and what I believe is reality is the huge made up story.
Nothingâs changed, nothingâs changed. I look about this old memory I am now re-living, and everything from the writing on the wall, to  the paint job, to the people is exactly the same (with the exception of a few oddballs). I love the constancy of this beloved place is something I know I can rely on. I love the respect I get from everyone, and the old summer friends are my continuous invitation to keep coming back. Nope, nothingâs changed.
What you are about to read is a âQuick Writeâ. A âQuick Writeâ is an activity we did in my eighth grade English class. Our teacher gives us a topic to write about. We get a generally short time limit to write as much as we can about this topic keeping it as legible as we can. In this âQuick Writeâ the topic was My Best Friend. We were to describe our best friend, or if you didnât have one, you could write about what your best friend would be like. That was my circumstance.  My best friend would be a great person, perfect in my eyes. Heâd be easy to talk to. Heâd always listen and Heâd be great at giving advice. I wouldnât be afraid to tell Him my deepest, darkest secrets; Iâd know He would keep them. He would not be judgmental. My best friend would never ask why I am the way I am, or why I do the things I do; He would already know. He would be extremely intelligent. I would never have to explain myself to Him; Heâd simply accept everything. He would never be bitter at me for my wrong doings, but would always praise me for the things I do right. Heâd be the only one with an unconditional love for me. He would never play favorites; Heâd treat everyone as equals. Above all, my best friend would be a Christian, a healthy Christian who was very close to God. Heâd be my best friend.  It was not until when I read it aloud to my mother when I noticed I chose my best friend to be male. I couldnât explain why. Then she pointed out that every time the nameless friend was mentioned, I had capitalized the pronoun. Thatâs pretty uncommon in the English language, unless of course you are referring to God or Jesus. Read the âQuick Writeâ again. Doesnât it seem to describe God/Jesus?
You think youâve known yourself forever and will know yourself foreverâ¦ until you change. The truth is you donât truly know yourself. Never have, never will. For you are wearing a maskâ¦ a thousand masks. And you never really change; you just remove one mask knowing another is beneath it. Yourself is your biggest, most well kept secret of all times. The only time you can ever reveal your secret is in you dreams. In your dreams all your masks are stripped from you. You see how you truly are. But when you awake, you forget your dreams, yourself, your hidden identity. You put on your thousand masks, so just incase one falls off you can never be seen. And you step into a world of masked people. You step into a masked world.
Have you ever felt so horrible: like a million knifes stabbing your body all at once. The pain is imbedded in you. Not only physically, but mentally too. It seeps deeper, opening every wound in you not yet completely healed. The knives penetrate through your entire body and sloe. All pain, physical and mental, becomes one thing. One ever-lasting thing. The process to heal such a great wound could take more than a lifetime. Death seems so relieving right now. But then you just freeze. You are iced. You canât think, but thoughts are racing through your mind. You canât speak, but you have so much to say. You canât move, but you just canât stay still. You donât feel. Nothing seems real. You slip into a conscious coma. A stage of literal nothingness, with a numb pain.
âThatâs not fair!â I work with a ton of little kids, so this statement is too well known. My response is usually, âLifeâs not fair.â One night after a completely âunfairâ day, I thought about it. I thought about how you could explain lifeâs not fair. I decided to take a religious stand on this subject. I came up with this:  If life was supposed to be fair, weâd all go to hell. Do you think itâs fair that the most PERFECT man, who never sinned in his entire life, was tortured and killed for OUR sins and wrongdoings? But if life was fair, Jesus would not have died for us, therefore, we would not be saved. We would not have a chance to go to Heaven. So yes, lifeâs not fair, but it was never meant to be.
Some people say, âItâs not where you are going that matters, itâs the journey on the way.â This may be true for some; however, there are those who see it through my eyes. What if you know the journey is so rough, so unbearable, and you know you just might not be able to make it through. Do you be an optimist and lie to yourself: tell yourself it will be great and easy, only to let yourself down time and time again? I donât. That is why I believe you should live for the destination: the âUtopiaâ beyond the hardships. What sense dose it make to live for the harsh path? It makes much more sense to live for the tranquility that awaits you on the other side of it all. Journey~ Harsh Sharp Painful Unbearable Rough Intolerable Agonizing Excruciating Awful Insufferable Horrendous Insupportable Violent Ruthless Fierce Vicious Emotional Anguish Suffering Destination~ Utopia Tranquil Calm Serene Peaceful Relaxing Bliss Soothing Relief Perfect Soft Constant Lovely Wonderful Paradise  Which one do you want to live for: the journey or the destination?
Death can be a scary thing. It only seems like that because we know so little about it. We donât know when our decease will take place, or where for that matter, or what is after death, although there are many opinions. Everybody is different, so I can only speak for myself, but death to me is in fact daunting. Iâm not really frightened of how I die, it doesnât matter that much to me. Iâm not apprehensive about what happens to me after death, I believe my God will take me to heaven. Iâm afraid of when I will die. Iâm afraid that when I die, the people who I know would never have heard what I had to tell them, especially my family. Iâm afraid that Iâd pass before I told them I loved them so much. I couldnât imagine their lives after I died without having a clear conscience that I loved them. Iâd think they would think of my last memory of them trying to remember if it was a positive memory. Nobody wants to be remembered pessimistically. I want them all to know that I appreciate them all so much and I love them with all my heart.
I love to dance. I love the natural high I get from dancing. My movement is so limitless. Every emotion can be told through dance. I canât even begin to explain the rush I get from dancing. I get so lightheaded. I donât care what other people think. I donât care what I look like, or what Iâm doing. I become so incredibly care free. I am never free from stress anymore. Iâm constantly working, and am always stressed out. I can never get a break! But when Iâm dancing, I stop thinking. Everything lifts from my shoulders. I can move freely. There is absolutely nothing on my mind when Iâm dancing, and I get light headed and dizzy. When I need to escape, I turn on the radio and wait for a good song to come on. Then I dance until I can hardly move anymore. Everything is forced from me. No more anger, anxiety, depression, stress, ECT. I am completely tranquil. Dance.
People are always saying, âJust be yourselfâ. When you say, âI donât know how to act in this situationâ, they always say, âJust be yourselfâ. But what if âyourselfâ, I mean the way you truly are when no one is watching, it not what they wanted or expected. You are constantly rejected for âyourselfâ. How would anybody attain friends or a significant other?  Certainly not by being you. So according to the surrounding people, be it at home, at church, with your friends, you put on an act to satisfy their wants in a person. Like a chameleon, you change your colors, attitudes, style, personality, completely change yourself to match and blend in to your surroundings. So when people say, âJust be yourself,â think about it. They are really saying âLook, act, beâ¦ how I want you to be.â
Have you ever had the feeling you were alone? Even though the whole world is surrounding you, they arenât really with you at all. I was sitting next to my best friend and her boyfriend who at that time was my crush. I look down at their hands, holding each otherâs hands. I look down at my hands holding nobodyâs but my own. As I was walking to my next class, with my arms crossed, I saw them again. This time they were hugging. Again I look at myself to see that I was in fact hugging nobody but myself. I really shouldnât feel so alone, but for some unknown reason I do. It is painful, being alone and all. But I know thereâs someone out there for me too. Actually, I KNEW there was someone out there for me, until I met my love. I finally found him. There is nobody that could compare to him. Until fate breaks us apart, which we both know will happen soon, Iâm NOT alone. For once, Iâm not alone.
urlLink     im new to this, CAN you tell!- god how do i create a links column
Election time has rolled around again. And everyone is spitting their venom at each other in hopes of impressing the public with their 'tact'. Um..what. Instead of pointing your greedy little fingers and accusing Mr So and So, why don't you do one better, and tell us what YOU'RE going to do for us. Im sick of hearing what he did, how badly they did it, or how they didnt but should have. Says YOU. I guess it isnt like anyone is bound to believe anything you white collared putzs have to say anywya. You always do the opposite. I've been trying to educate myself on the different political platforms to figure out which I can identify with most. Personally, for some, I think lying would gather more votes. Shit, no wonder the libertarians never make it into office. To blatantly state    'We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating AFDC, food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest. Individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market must, once again, learn to rely on supportive family, church, community, or private charity to bridge the gap.' ...is a ballsy move.  Oh? You thought that was it? Theres more:  'The bulk of your welfare tax dollars goes to pay the handsome salaries of well-educated welfare workers. The poor get little from government welfare except meager handouts and a cycle of despair.' Again...ummmm, what? So, let me get this right....government should stop paying the 'meager handouts' to families in need, and instead have those families go begging churches and charities for even smaller handouts..because...those 'meager' handouts are causing the moneywell to go dry? But hey, it's ok to throw cash at foreign countries and help THEIR people out. Who cares that most of them deteste the United States, and somewhere in their hearts pray for our annihilation. I bet those little bastards setting our flag on fire and stomping all over it after 9/11, aren't aware that our money covered their birth. Nothing better than paying for the future of terrorism.  Maybe i'm taking this personally, as I should. Because without the ever so popular 'welfare system'. My mother and myself might have suffered. Blah. I can see you all thinking that your precious greens have in some way helped me become the fine young woman I am today. BZZZZZZZT. Think again. The sum of monies my mother received could be accounted for with taxes paid out from my immediate family alone. She could have been on welfare for another 20 years, and technically, taxes paid by my extended families would have covered it. So i'll just thank them, and give you the middle finger for being arrogant enough to think that you have had any impact on my families financial prosperity. And now the shoe is on the other foot, or however it goes, and my taxes are paying for your sisters-mothers-best-friends-brother-nieces illegitimate kids. And to ease your silent curiousity, my mother is now a very successful businesswoman. So suck my tampon string.  Here is another Liberal issue, surely the cure to the nations healtcare AND war on drugs. Let's just legalise it!!! It's typical of the liberal party to promote the legalisation of drugs isn't it. I mean, for their stance on issues alone, they have to be smoking or snorting something. The liberals take on anything seems to be 'We can't control it so lets just legalise it and save ourselves the time and money it would take to correct it.' If you see it that way, you're a plain idiot. Does rehabiliation not cost money? Do damages not cost money? Ok, give some kid easy access to some pot, so they can fall asleep at the wheel and crash into a building. Or kill someone. 'Drugs should be legal. Individuals have the right to decide for themselves what to put in their bodies, so long as they take responsibility for their actions.' Ok, well when these users are irresponsible and their actions endanger other people, .. THEN WHAT? Let me guess, have their parents bear the responsibility. Riiight.  'Addicts out of control were a tiny minority.' Um...So was obesity. See how thats change. And food IS legal!  I can almost picture it...1972, after a demonstration on public sex, and the art of smoking pot through your girlfriends vagina, a group of teenage dropouts were arrested and spent a night in jail where they concocted this notion that if everything were legalised, the standard of their living would be improved and fuck consequences of drug induced peoples, fuck work performance, fuck cost of consequences, fuck everyone else. And the liberal party was formed.

it was fun :)  Hey dad        Iâm writing to you, not to tell you that I still hate you, just to ask you how you feel and how we fell apart, how this fell apart. Are you happy out there in this great wide world? Do you think about your sons? Do you miss your little girl? When you lay your head down how do you sleep at night? Do you even wonder if weâre all right. Weâre alright. Weâre alright. Itâs been a long hard road without you by my side. Why werenât you there all the nights that we cried? You broke my motherâs heart, you broke your children for life. Itâs not ok but weâre alright. I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes. But those were just a long lost memory of mine. I spent so many years learning how to survive. Now Iâm writing just to let you know that Iâm still alive. The days I spent so cold, so hungry, were full of hate, I was so angry, the scars run deep inside this tattooed body. Thereâs things Iâll take to my grave, but Iâm ok, Iâm ok. Itâs been a long hard road without you by my side. Why werenât you there all the nights that we cried? You broke my motherâs heart, you broke your children for life. Itâs not ok but weâre alright. I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes. But those were just a long lost memory of mine. I spent so many years learning how to survive. Now Iâm writing just to let you know that Iâm still alive. And sometimes I forgive, yeah and this time Iâll admit that I miss you, said I miss you.  Itâs been a long hard road without you by my side. Why werenât you there all the nights that we cried? You broke my motherâs heart, you broke your children for life. Itâs not ok but weâre alright. I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes. But those were just a long lost memory of mine. I spent so many years learning how to survive. Now Iâm writing just to let you know that Iâm still alive And sometimes I forgive, yeah and this time Iâll admit that I miss you, said I miss you...hey dad -emotionless  ring ring ring ring ring ring ring - banana phone!   Rose said:   'When love abandons and hate dissipates, just a memory commemorates, a time spent not to forget, anger fades and there's no regret. done and dusted, emotion evades me, a place i trusted, left safety to save me.'

war is every why are we so fixated with it?? its in present life, history lessons n now english lessons. tho i do love Brooke's work i guess i can't complain i get to study somit i love. and the book we're readin is quite good - 'birdsong' by Sebastian Faulks... 'A few months later, on his next visit, he took Isabelle for a walk in the garden and told her that he was being posted abroad and that he was not in a position to continue their friendship. he skated round the question of marriage with pleas of poverty and unworthiness. isabelle didn't care whether he married her or not, but when he said he would not see her again she felt the simple agony of bereavement, like a child whose only source of love has gone. for three years her loss coloured every moment of her day. when at last it became bearable it was still like a wound on which the skin would not thicken, so the least thing could reopen it. the reckless innocence of her unguided childhood was finished, but eventually a sweetness and balance in her nature returned.' this section stands out to me. the book has yet to mention war actually lol but a very steamy (and by the woman's description - very satisfying) scene! 'she was choking with passion for him, but he frightened her. she wanted to comfort him but also to be taken by him, to be used by him.' hmm i like this book lol newas gota go watch the match! sarah xxx
i can't wait for things to get moving, i want out of here. im lookin forward to uni although it means another 3 years in england. it should be so much fun from my experiences of it so far and my brother's experiences. after uni though it will be another year i guess before i can move, as i'll need to work for 'bout that long to get some money. will be quite lonely i imagine as every1 will have moved on by then. i wana work in a pub, duno why, not any pub, not a big pub, i'd love to work the fox n hound by jill's - it's small n friendly, i think thats what attracks me to bein a barmaid - every1 thinks its somit to look down on but what's so bad bein surrounded by people in a friendly (if smoky :s) atmosphere? mayb im naive... also hav a job lined up with jill i hope :) i love the sound of what she plans to do and she says she'll employ me :) ur pretty much self-employed to be honest so it should happen n im into herbal homeopathic stuff so sounds good for me. after that id love to work in italy or canada. i cant speak italian so that leaves canada lol. although i don't have enough points for a visa :( i hav a friend who's gona help me as he's canadian (thats gota help!) and if i end up workin for a whole year before i go then that shld give me more points, plus im gona try learn french alongside my psychology degree, i wana speak french newas but now i hav a goal for it and will give me more points the better at it i am. the biggest problem is probably death - i.e. getting in a plane... ive been thinkin bout takin a flight course to help me feel more prepared for flying, but i don't see how im gona erase the knowledge that it could crash - and if it does it's the worst possible thing to be in that crashes. i dont wana die. if i do, i dont wana die like that. but then more than not wanting to die, i wana live, i know wot i mean... which brings me onto the fact that i realy should start jogging again. i wana b able to do the 10mile fun run next year to raise money for something that keeps catching my eye, i seem to read about it in magazines n papers all the time, n things through the door, it breaks my heart, if there's nethin i can do i wana do it. not because im such a great person just because ive seen the effects.... newas...will b a new years resolution lol im pathetic camp america should be cool too, wish it was this summer though as im gona b bored outa my brain n probs comit suicide for somit fun to do...talkin of which my mum thinks im on drugs, seriously do i come across as that abnormal n screwed? i guess we just have different views on what's normal, what emotions n behaviour are acceptable, whats good for us etc. o well arrivedechi x

so im back - yay! rnt we all so happy bout that, i sure am. &nbsp; grr hav a pic called wind... wrote this (dont ask me why)&nbsp;but takin me ages to put it onto the pic  :(  Wind   She wandered down the cold stone steps; wind whistling through the thick air, causing her wispy hair to flutter about her face like black silk scarves in a teasing dance.  Foriegn leaves skittered after her, pushing her further away from their familiar habitat, chasing her to the border of her own world. Falling - to her inexorable melancholy bare-existance.  She'd like to see the arrow splintered in his pulse, she'd like to see his eyes flood with lies. Drawing in. Sucking; bleeding; watching you gasping. A little smile plays upon her lips, her eyes excitedly wide - they narrow again, as her fingers step to a lament only she can hear, echoing throughout her hollow mind.  Numb. Entrapt in this bitter wind.  Kneeling down in the dirt, one long nail traces a symbol. Lifting a blue teardrop from beneath small lashes - it's blessed. Rising, dizzy with energy, she falters, regains control, she holds the chains now.  She binds and sways the wind to her desire, encircling her 'til she cannot breathe. She'll take your breath with her instead.  &nbsp; blah blah blah, *skins herself n hangs it up to dry* 'take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green n the girls are pretty* wow i hav so much to say xBWx :( &nbsp;
actualy im gona carry on writin cos now i feel even shiter and cryin again. y do i put up with so much crap from ppl wen ppl seem to turn against me so easily? so from reading joe's blog i realise actualy he kinda hates me now. wot did i say? tried to make light of a situation by sayin 'u gota be nice to me to get custody, n il stil get to live with u at weekends but mum in the week cos that seems to be how it works' there was no meanin behind that jus simply an observation or somit id assumed which was wrong. last time i try n joke about. i was harsh, tho truthful, cos i dnt handle ppl i care bout being off with me, im extremely sensitive - like i said weak n pathetic. so i said somit out of line, n seems ppl dnt kno how to forgive. well i never claimed to be a good friend or a good person, i do try, i jus suck. if ne1 i thort beca wld push me away cos i kno how hard it is for her but she dsnt seem to hold it against me hanging out wit joe, gona miss her next week. i dnt know how im gona handle next week. im not xactly in the mood for a challenge now.
today's been crap, havnt felt like this for a while. im hoping its pms lol thats wot im puttin it down to, i think mayb to do with joe, but at least seems to b tlkin to me now... mayb its cos i been happy n hyper for a cple of weeks n its jus impossible to go so long without breakin down n cryin lol. i hate myself sumtimes tho, i feel so weak for lettin small things upset me, im too vulnerable wen it comes to other ppl, its pathetic but i always do it. and now im coming across as a miserable cow. im not, ive been so much better lately. its jus today. and this will pass. tho il be in germany - i dont want to be but o well. n i deserve it sumtimes, im not mean most of the time honest jus realy stupid i dnt intentionaly offend ppl very often, jus my fat ugly mouth. gona stop writin cos jus babbling randomly depressin stuff
will post properly later, shld be in skool but instead listnin to music doin german coursework :s hoobastank are cool, for example - running away: I don't want you to give it all up And leave your own life collecting dust And I don't want you to feel sorry for me You never gave us a chance to be And I don't need you to be by my side To tell me that everything's alright I just wanted you to tell me the truth You know I'd do that for you Why are you running away? Why are you running away? Cause I did enough to show you that I Was willing to give and sacrifice And I was the one who was lifting you up When you thought your life had had enough And when I get close, you turn away There's nothing that I can do or say So now I need you to tell me the truth You know I'd do that for you So why are you running away? Why are you running away? Is it me, is it you Nothing that I can do To make you change your mind Is it me, is it you Nothing that I can do Is it a waste of time? Is it me, is it you Nothing that I can do To make you change your mind So why are you running away? Why are you running away? ...What is it I've got to say... So why are you running away? ...To make you admit you're afraid... Why are you running away?  hmm *turn music off...go to school!*  ~Disturbed Angel - Beautifully Decayed~
Met Lim this morning, then we went to SPC to get help from Raymond.MATHS..no choice la..cos there's a maths quiz coming up and our lecturer is damn boring. Seriously, yesterday was the very first time I really can listen and pay attention during maths with minimal distraction.  Went to TP in the afternoon with Janice and Mandy..studed in the library till it close..Badminton at 5pm, TP sports hall..I only managed to do little stuff at TP cos I can't study outside..many pple plus distractions..so irritating.  Headed for TM after that..Went NTUC to buy fruits and bars. Then Janice didn't allow me to go home. So accompanied her to YAMAHA..she wanna buy a new guitar. Rich girl.
Such a boring day. I have no comments. I found out that I'm the shortest girl in my class. Had very healthy food today. I shall not mention what they are. Cos I can't be bothered to do so right now.
Nuts. As usual, Theo and I played with food. Today's creation consisted of USA waffle, ice cream, hershey's choc syrup, QOO Lemon, ice kachang, maple syrup, chilli sauce, butter, tomato ketchup. So interesting. We did something worse after that. Theo poured the solution into Roy's drink can. Crap.   During lesson, we were still crapping. Making fun of HoFM. Theo imitated her la..trying to be funny. TBCM was worse. Only the other half of the class (the rest of the girls) were paying attention and doing their work seriously. The rest of us were gave stupid answers all the time. Theo was drawing throughout. The thing is, we were seated right in front of the teacher's table. First row somemore. hahaha...   After sch, Lim,Wilson,Theo and I went to IKEA. Lim wanted to go there to buy toys, for dunno what reason. We went there for hot dog first. Cheap and nice. Theo and I shared one cos both of us scared fat. Then we played with all the sauce. Custard,chilli and tomato. This time the mixture was nice..so smooth..hahaha...went to walk after that. hee..Then after that Wilson suddenly appeared behind us. But nvm...   Went to TM with Theo and Wilson&nbsp;after that. Kept laughing on the mrt. Theo kept imitaing and making fun of HoFM n GeokEng..wahaha..Wilson went to arcade to play while waiting for his friend. Theo and I went to walk. Then we went NTUC. After that I went home and he went to Orchard.   Tml still can play with food. cos we got one and half hr break. so good!
Met up with Lim,Wilson,Roy and Theo for breakfast at Mac. I insisted want to go Mac cos wanted to play with food. So disgusting lor..Theo and I played with all the sauce. Mix honey,butter,sugar,coffee-mate,tomato ketchup,chilli sauce,coffee,milo and tartar sauce together. Fun but just gotta bear with the smell on our fingers after that. So fun to play with food. 17 years old already still play..so childish rite? The worst thing is that Theo blow bubble into the disgusting mixture using straw. yucks..eww..  After school, Roy,Lim,Wilson,me,Keith,Nicholas,Addison and Valerie went to Sakae at HarbourFront. Addison's treat.We had buffet. Total cost was $143.80. Too bad Theo didn't want to come along at the last minute, otherwise, we can really play with food.  Lim was perfectly normal today, which is quite unusual. She'd been nuts(to the power of infinity) for the past two days.  Giggles is very alert despite her age. Her lecture was damn boring that Theo and I started to write messages BUT she noticed us. Haiz..but one thing.&nbsp; The teachers din bother to stop us from eating sweets in class.It's against the rule to eat in class..but who cares, rite? Rules are meant to be broken(quote Mandy)..
Today's lunch was on Addison, Mr Rich man. Went to pizza hut for lunch. The meal totalled up to about $59.++ It's not a problem to him cos he's so rich and $60 is nothing to his father..haha..  Wilson and Jerren ate like gluttons, as usual. Hmm..leftover food..wonder what happened to them? Theo and I played with the leftover food..mixing everything together till it smelled horrid..but was real fun. Jerren took a pic of the disgusting creation, Lim can't be bothered..too disgusted. The state of the leftover food is gonna be worse tml. lolx...crappy plans..depends..see where we go first. Basically, leftover food will NEVER be in good state when tampered with CREATIVE people like me..haha
Hmm..we didn't do UWOS tutorial 3 for homework cos we din know that it's supposed to be done..nvm..anyway....  Theodore and I brought our neoprints and prom pics today. He's really very FAT when he was in sec sch and also looks very different. Super duper different. Now he so ai mei..wear contacts..haha..but I'm still FAT as I always am. very funny..Lim and I laughed when we saw his pic..  Oh ya! Our NOODLE family was formed today. All thanks to Wilson. He's already so skinny yet he wants to go to slimming centre. Cos of his size, Lim called him noodle.  Then Theo named the rest of us. Jerren:bee hoon, Wilson:mee sua, Theo:mee hoon kuay, Steph Yap:yu mian, Steph Lim:ee mian, Roy:meepok..He named the remaining girls fishball, fishcake, tau gay, tau kua, tau pok and cockel..wahahaha! Our TBCM teacher was called ban mian cos of her hair..Very mean rite? But nvm..  Basically, we're crapping the whole day. See the TBCM teacher already can laugh. But Theo kept making me laugh during DBMS. Observe the teacher's eyes and the way she speaks, then IMITATE! not his fault la..we gotta have eye contact with the teacher when lessons are going on..*Theo imitates the way she pops her eye* (pop_your_eye.enabled = True) haha.. ;p  Lim's damn hyper today. Kept on talking and making noise non-stop, since the time we met in the morning till the end of school..still can't stop. uh oh...something's wrong. She accidentally caused Wilson to drop Jerren's hp on the floor till it was dismantled into a million partitions. But miraculously, the hp din go bonkers!  It's such  a fun day (except for DBMS prac. I lost my Country table..haha..) I'm still very alert now..but the effect of the caffeine from the coffee I had this morning is gonna be 'OFF' soon..getting tired. tml got MATHS..so sianz..of all subjects, MATHS!! ARGH!  ALERT WARNING: 'SP CMI detected at T17, Level 5' ..use real-time for more details. (time-critical) Eye-witnesses please call the CMI. Rewards will be given for the first 2 callers. Attractive prizes include a lanyard and a bottle of peanut butter.  hahahaha~!!
It's Sunday..today is the launch of our Chinese service..quite cool. I was planning to join Chinese congregation but Charissa said I'm mad or something like that. haha..i dun really mind her saying that. cos i agree that my Chinese is terrible.&nbsp; Anyway i'll be attending Chinese service with Si Ning and Janice Lim(if she wakes up early to go church). Today we went to Geylang for lunch, for a change. Tried smelly beancurd..it really stinks and i hate it. yucks! if it was tasty, it wouldn't be named 'smelly beancurd'..lolx..   It's already been three weeks since school started and I guess I'm getting along fine. Except that I dun really like the practicals. so sickening and troublesome. But I'm a student, so i gotta study..School's real FUN! especially having new friends around me and we always crap and do all sorts of funny stuff like the happy tree friends thingy..but it was cool rite? haha..new friends..hmm..pple such as Roy,Theodore,Wilson(very dao),Jarren(pinky),Keith(Scooby Doo),Jeremy,Nicholas..Steph Lim is old fren..hmm..basically this group of us go for lunch together..BUT there's these few of us who're always late for every lesson..me,Lim,Roy,Theo,Wilson,Jarren...cos we're in the same class..hahaha :p   The subjects that we study are quite okie..(except for practicals!) TBCM can be considered the best tutorial..cos the teacher is easy to get along with and we can do all sorts of funny things like locking her outta class and using her account to logon to happy tree friends..wahahaha~the next subject that i like is CRS..cos there's no maths and practical required..our first homework for CRS was to watch Spiderman 2..can u believe it??   I'll stop my crap now..cos I think I'm writing too much and it's only the first entry!

Doing VB prac now. so boring. so sian. can't recall what I'd learnt last week. irritating
Today we had bible study after school. Quite boring as had a long day. Everything was boring except DBMS prac. Priscilla asked a question in the bible study material: How do you confess your sin?  I was very sleepy and bored, so an answer came to my mind. And of course, I shared my answer. See ah..to confess sin.  Step 1: Commit a sin. Without a sin, how can you ever confess?? Step 2: Do some reflection about the sin. Step 3: Confess and you shall be forgiven.  Common sense answer right? No sin, how to confess? So must commit a sin in order to confess. haha..nonsense la.  I was very satisfied with my meals today. Didn't eat breakfast. Had one energy bar, two packet of watermelon, one packet of honeydew for lunch. And of course, sweets during lesson time. As usual. For dinner, I had one packet of hello panda, one kiwi and one green apple.  Hope to lose more weight. No pain no loss.
Such a boring day. Woke up late then didn't go for piano lesson, didn't go for service. Just stayed at home to rot. Practise piano, eat, sleep, study..so boring rite? Actually got morning call..but I was too sleepy. Cos I didn't want to sleep yesterday, even though I was really really tired. Haven't been sleeping enough. But nvm..I got ways to keep myself awake just to sit through boring lectures. Half a can of coffee every morning before class starts will do the trick. So boring. There's school for me tml. so happy. Dun have to stay at home. Can see my friends and play and crap. hahaha..
Well, I hate to start off no such a sour note, but things haven't been going so great with me lately and here's the dirty.  Well, my job (I work as a Quality Assurance Tester) isn't that great, and they've been laying people off left and right at my job. I just found out today that this one guy got the axe a few weeks ago, but was told that his last day will be sometime in OCTOBER!!! Can you imagine being told that you aren't an asset to the corporation but that they want to hold on to you for two more months? I couldn't imagine it myself.   Aside from that everything with my boyfriend and I aren't going that well. He just seems to never really hear me. He's always so defensive and he never wants to be wrong. He can say somethng that he doesn't like about me, but then when I say the littlest negative thing about him he's all defensive and saying 'oh why do you switch it and make me look like i'm the bad person?' Come on give me a break. I've seen him 5 times in the last three weeks, but he see's nothing wrong with that. I mean people that live in different states see there loved one more then I see mines.  And then to add fuel to the fire I found out that I'm the victim of credit card fraud. I can't believe the asshole only left me with $20 on my credit card! Thank God I have others, and thank God I don't have to pay for what I didn't use.  Then my girlfriend, whom I've known since High School, is having a baby so me, and two of her childhood friends along with her brother are throwing her a shower. Well, at least we thought that we were. My girlfriend sent us information about what she would like for her party, but one of the girls is taking matters into her own hands. She replied to my friends message telling her that she need to mention anything because WE have it covered. Then she sends out the so called 'Party Committee' an email, and here are some excerpt from it:  1.) Theme:  'Red. her favorite color and because it's a boy she and I decided the shower has a red theme. She just told me in an email red and white and now she is looking for yellow but since i am in charge of decorations, I fell confident we can stick to our original color theme. Id we have to use an additional color that's cool, no one shohuld break their necks but white on red NOT red on white, which is totally diffferent. '  I mean seriousl, I don't thin that the whole 'Red Theme' is suitable for a baby shower. I agree more with the yellow. There will be kids there as well, so I just think that it should be somethng that would appeal both to adult and children. It is a baby shower for crying out loud.  2.) 'We will have red theme drinks and decoration. no cartoon prints like Blues Clues, Disney, etc. for example, She likes this giraffe that is yellow with red spots (he id not famous, she just seen it somewhere). This baby shower has more of a sophisticated dinner party feel as opposesd to a traditional baby shower feel. We will have red roses as the center pieces instead of one of those baby shower things.   ARE YOU KIDDING ME? A SOPHISTICATED DINNER PARTY, we have to serve the people appetizers on trays. Am i playing servent for the night or what? Can i sit and enjoy the day with my friend? I don't understand why you want a dinner party instead of a baby shower and on top of that there's not DJ! We (the Party Commiteess that is) has to make a mix CD each!  I mean why have a party committee if one person is making all the decisions?  Well, on a better note, i'm sooo excited about this coming weekend. My girlfriends and I are going to Six flags. I haven't been out there since I was about 12, which has been to long.
i was a weedy child. this wasn't so much an accident of physiology, more an unnecessary attempt by the world to fully cast me in the role of maths geek. of course, at that age i wasn't of a mind to worry; but eventually i decided that i was hideous. there is one particular family holiday where all the photos have me hiding in the shadows, for fear of nothing less than being seen.  and then i grew up a little; and found out that whilst i would never be very well built, so to speak, i had quietly grown to a respectable height amongst my peers. i started putting more stock not in how i looked but how i carried myself; i started losing my clumsiness. and now whilst i'm still not much to look at, my body ususlly does what i ask of it, what i need it to.  i got comfortable with myself, i accepted what i was never going to be. although i could never be a nudist, and for two very good reasons: i) the cold, and ii) my need for pockets.  and did i mention, the cold?  i generally have lots of things in my pockets; i find it is one of the better things about men's clothes: there is no 'line' to ruin, as such. so i feel if naturism was to become compulsory, i'd need some sort of utility belt. and a nipple piercing to stop me losing my keys, obviously, but firstly a utility belt. being naked is no excuse for not having a grappling hook handy...   man, i'm tired.   n.
i have developed a pain in my chest that is quite worrying; whether it has arisen from an almost entirely carbohydrate-based diet or from over-stretching during an impromptu kata is unclear; the fact that it is making it harder to sleep is undeniable. although certain claims on my snoring would seem to indicate otherwise. add to this the effects of returning to training after an extended bout of laziness, and we have a recipe for why i am only just surfacing now to eat the chocolate muffin left for me.  i hope the pain goes away; being the paranoid type is never easy at these times. also in light of the amount of dwontime i've been having; its a medical observation that the longer you stay in bed past the 'normal' eight hours or so, the greater your chances of having a stroke....  well, i think its funny.   almost five months to the day of living here, i realise i do not own a can-opener. this can be interpreted as a good sign (i don't live off canned food), or a bad sign (i live on toast; toast doesn't come in cans). ah well.   plans for today: call evil car hire firm call non-evil laura eat non-evil food pay evil credit card bill maybe even go outside   the world is my (non-evil) lobster.  n.
i have been given a book to read, one that will 'change the way i think'. praise indeed; although i find that expectation often leads to a greater chance of disappointment. the inscription, however, is touching:  'neil, never forget just how awesome you are!'   some days i don't feel so awesome.   after drinking a mixture of lagers and the sweet tonic of white russian, the idea of toast is more appealing than during everyday life. and yet the night was set to get so much better than that: buttered toast.... and gravy. don't take my word for it; go and try it yourself! inebriation optional. we had to go to the shops for more bread because we ran out. more evidence that making do with what you have is more than just a way of living; it is essential for progress.   the sun has temporarily graced us with its return, and the free-flowing air of outside this room is calling. also, i have a friend who (i suspect) may need help eating that tub of ice cream...   hugs: squizzer toast and gravy gargantuan paul the postal service  slaps: hay fever   n.
(it is never good to start on a digression. however)  a digression: you know those conversations that go something along these lines?  -you're in a weird mood. -no i'm not. -yes you are, what's wrong? -i'm not in a weird mood! -don't shout at me!   i hate those.   so, to the point: patriotism. in specific reference to the england football team being knocked out of [whatever tournament it is that's on at the moment] this evening. it was an exciting match, but i'm glad that england lost. note i didn't say 'we'. and why? because those eleven men playing football out there aren't doing it for me; they don't know me, i don't know them, i didn't ask them to play football for me. in no way do they represent me, and certainly not as a result of them being from the same country as me.  ergh. but i mustn't go on so. calm down.   blogger food of the day: uncle ben's express rice. genius! it comes in a packet that stands up in your microwave, it takes two minutes, you don't have to refrigerate it, and its quite tasty. especially at one in the morning when you're all toasted out.   hugs: alex and her talk of bra shopping uncle ben's express rice staplers (a bit random, i know, but they are cool, aren't they?) 'space raiders' crisps - ten pence? bargain! the manchester cow parade   slaps: indigestion from eating toast and rice too quickly   (sheesh...)  and no, i'm *not* in a mood...  n.
is getting up at five in the afternoon more acceptable if you went to bed at five in the morning? i hope so. the good thing about midsummer away from the equator is that the sky never really gets very dark, especially in the sodium orange pool of greater manchester. overcast, but never truly black.  honesty breeds clarity; and some fairly frank discussions of ongoing problems [financial, motivational, female] leads simon to remark how happy he is to see 'how far i have come off the rails'. hmmm. i live to please.  note 1: red wine consumption leads to hangovers. note 2: do not mix red wine with pimm's. note 3: or whisky. note 4: even if these are all you have. note 5: do not serve pimm's by the pint.   the discussion of kung fu techniques that interlaced our drinking was quite illuminating; how shotokan karate shares similar traits with shaolin (not counter-intuitive, but enlightening to actually see in practice), and how multiple punch/block techniques are somewhat pointless. comparison of fighting distances reveals differences in philosophy.  note 6: fairy lights look good on yucca plants.   simon's plans to improve society are simple but ambitious: to take over the world as supreme dictator. he is currently looking for a hollowed-out volcano as a base for his evil empire, but no luck so far. as far as volcanos go, its just not geared up to the first time evil buyer. i mean, just graduated from evil university with all those evil student loans? its a bugger.  note 7: its a bugger.   good luck to squizzer, and to the barmypharmie for their pre-reg exams tomorrow.   initial shopping list: flora milk bread  other factors to consider: its, like, *so* raining, and, like, whatever.  revised shopping list:   (looks like popcorn for tea again)  n.
we are drinking and talking of unrequited love.  n.
in a moment of clarity i looked up the tablature for 'tightrope', by the stone roses. a truly beautiful wonderful song, and one that i have every intention of playing at some point when the mysterious 'band' gets together. acoustic singalongs were never so cool:  are we etched in stone,  or just scratched in the sand waiting for the waves to come  and reclaim the land?   and then, in a moment of complete insanity, i looked up the tablature for 'good times', by the stone roses. why? delusions of adequacy, and nothing more. oh my good god, there is no way i will ever ever learn to play that. [aside: i probably could, but it would need to be a full-time job and i'm fairly sure no-one's going to pay me for that, alas.] i get as far as 0:26 and then its into the main riff and i've no space to fit all those notes in.   it brings up the issue of 'the second coming', though, which is a vastly underrated album in my opinion. to have those two completely different songs next to each other and to have it work is an indication of something, even if five years is a long time to wait. definitely worth having; good summer guitar tunes. disregarding the rain, that is.   interesting fact: on the set of '24 hour party people', i met the fake john squire - that is, the actor playing john squire in the film. and yet, he doesn't appear in the film at all. shame; he had good john squire hair. presumably left on the cutting room floor...  n.
an incident yesterday when a girl i was talking to on messenger clicked 'accept' for webcam feed before realising that she wasn't actually wearing a top. her modesty (and my fun) was saved by an uncompromising norton pop-up that has increasingly more to answer for. ah well.   the rain is as insistent as it is unwelcome, not to mention inappropriate for this time of year. good weather for the following:  hot chocolate writing songs staying inside shaving   okay, not shaving, but i do need to. also washing; where do all my pants go? it's a mystery.   as this blog unfolds i'm sure my master plans (plural; what master plan would be complete without at least one foolproof contingency?) will become clear, but for now i must go and busy myself with the ongoing preliminary stages. that is, maybe have a biscuit and watch the tv for a while.  hugs: themadnesshamster  more to follow.  n.
whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. and whilst giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post.  lucky we did.  who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? not i, for certain. i list but a few:  buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue. buy 600 plastic wallets, get a crate of diet coke. buy 3 boxes of pilot hi-techpont pens, get an inflatable basketball set. buy 4 boxes of manila envelopes, get a gazebo.   a gazebo?   the message here is clear: forget what you think you know, the world is far weirder than you thought. especially in the realm of office supplies.  n.
five in the afternoon is not a good time to be eating breakfast. that there is something wrong is not in question; what exactly that is is proving elusive. i'm fairly sure i wouldn't mind so much if my dreams were anything to write about, but they are mostly fairly horrible and occasionally, as was the case just now, end on a musical number featuring julie walters.  further involvement with local politics - the disassembling and analysis of a certain incident of assault - has strengthened my conviction that people can 'knob off'; that is to say that being emotional has never been an excuse for being wrong. of course, the real crux of the issue is that one week after passing my second dan i missed the only real fight that's ever happened here. ah well.   this blog is off to an interesting start; much more than the previous journal this is shaping up to be 'open', so much so that i may even tell people about it. radical, eh?   hugs: the most important meal of the day lelia varieties of shower gel '1 comments' an absence of spam soluble coffee  slaps: the need for washing the rolling on of days i don't like its raining some pieces [don't fit together]   n.
hiya,  i have some observations i'd like to share; like how sometimes it seems easier to go out of your way for people you don't know, and how once you start ignoring the 'phone it becomes easier and easier not to ever pick it up.  in recent stealth missions i acquired a popcorn maker; a neat little device that is essentially a hair-drier with a funnel attached. the heat makes the air difficult to breathe in but the snacks are worth it, especially now with my newly-acquired bottle of maple syrup. keep refrigerated once opened.  i hope some people have found me from my previous life; yes it's the same nmrboy that fled the collapse and resultant politics of [that] journal site. i hate politics. it seems that only those people that should never get into positions of power are the ones who want to run for election.  other recent acquisitions:  clothes horse fairy lights fairy liquid handwash microwave rice fruit bowl other types of bowl (not for fruit) cutlery desk lamp television table tea bags (240) coffee (5 jars) double lollies  etc etc. let's hear it for 'pre-emptive recycling'; being a womble was never so much fun as when the undergraduates leave their halls of residence and decide they're too lazy to take everything with them.   a gift today in the post; some cds and a charming card from a friend who recently stayed with me. a delightful girl whom i only met last sunday, but she needed a place to stay and what the heck! what i lack in judgement of character i make up in hope that, deep down, people are nice.  how foolish! and so to bed.  n.
&nbsp;  but solitaire is a lonely man's game.  &nbsp; abstraction is a wonderful skill; it not only allows me to separate my higher functions and so see myself as 'i' (the notation becomes tricky) see other people, but also allows me to effectively ignore the world.  &nbsp; other theories and observations that i intend to share are mainly statistical in nature; i am forever intrigued at the difference between the individual case and the ensemble outlook. so much of the world is chaotic; and yet the word itself defines the world as completely and rigorously deterministic. but even this is statistical; the macroscopic newtonian world is merely an ensemble of the quantum level, where chaos is replaced by true uncertainty.  and yet things fall downwards; and they always will. bizarre.  &nbsp; i am fascinated by the notion of bringing order from disorder; matt ridley is keen to point out that humans (and living creatures&nbsp;in general) are merely localised anomalies of order in a world overrun by entropy, and the second law of thermodynamics.  i am reminded of the startling man lennart green, a card magician extraordinaire. this is a man that can have a deck of cards shuffled, and will then restore the entire order (suits and values) without you noticing. it is astounding; i saw him do it at a lecture once, and i was impressed. i learned the theory of how to do it; i was more impressed.  this brings me to my favourite current way of wasting time: spider solitaire. here we have an unending supply of disorder, waiting to be ordered. and when you win, you click 'yes' and there are yet more cards to sort. lucky i'm not the obsessive type, eh?  (bugger)  &nbsp; still, the idea of patterns and order is one that i feel is worth exploring. it is my contention that we understand things simply because we recognise the patterns involved. this generally comes from experience - learning to 'see' by interpreting repeating patterns of light as 'objects', for example - and so when faced with the unrecognisable we want to understand the logic of the pattern. if we are able to recognise familiar patterns in everything then we understand everything, but only&nbsp;in terms of what we already knew. if we strive to form and learn new patterns with every new experience then we understand everything, but with nothing in relation to anything else. the true skill then is to recognise both the familiar and the familiar in anything new:  what of this have i felt before? what of this have i never felt before?  &nbsp; i am rambling. i shall leave you with a list, and then be off to play solitaire.  staples in my stapler: 1 pictures of alex on my wall: 2 pieces my sunglasses are currently in: 4 pills left: 5 pictures of dido visible from where i am sat: 7 balloons on my desk: 12  n.
&nbsp; in my head, and in response to an email i received discussing the separation of beauty and personality, i have compiled a top five list of girls i have been most attracted to. this list was much harder to make, and i'm still only up to four. at present,&nbsp;and in alphabetical order, it runs:  ceri charlotte chloe helen  &nbsp; the crucial point, though, is that none of the previous list appear here. the above were all girls i have been lucky enough to get to know well, whereas the previous list is made up more of acquaintances (exceptions are my sister and caroline). i leave you to make your own conclusion: do the above people appear more attractive because i know them well, or&nbsp;did i get to know them well because i firstly found them attractive? do the two go hand in hand because you will get to know people more if their personality fits yours, and thus you will also tend to find them more attractive?  disclaimer: i have no intention of upsetting anyone! i would be the first to concede that my opinions on many things are a little skewed; and i would urge anyone to remember that my notion of attractiveness is often in direct conflict with other people's. there is precisely no worldly advantage in being found attractive by me, unless you&nbsp;find&nbsp;me attractive in return. and how often does that happen?  &nbsp; so anyway; today's scheduled laundry was postponed for the duration of 'the magnificent seven', a wonderful film that i force on unsuspecting people from time to time. whilst it will cast me out of certain circles i will have to confess to never having seen 'the seven samurai', although i do like the kurosawa i have seen. my favourite quote from the film is yul brynner's response to the idea that farmers tell their women that the gunslingers will rape them:  'well, we might. in my opinion, though, you could have given us the benefit of the doubt.'  the dialogue throughout the film is brilliantly measured; i should like to write characters like that. maybe one day&nbsp;i shall.  &nbsp;  ongoing arguments with my mother struggle to keep within the boudaries of reason; she avoids the issue of whether she believes me (essentially anything i say, ever) despite my asking the question directly at least four times. i know the answer is no from everything else she says, but i still want to hear her say it. i can disprove all of her assumptions but she does not care for that. and in line with all the things my therapy is uncovering she demands of me that i suppress my own character. i have no desire to do that; maybe when i was young, but no more. when she starting telling me i didn't care i&nbsp;undoubtedly did, but these days my answer is tempered by the turbulence in my own mind over who i actually am. personality conflicts with conditioning; and the problem lies in that whatever shaped me has made me into someone who needs to question the validity of those implemented ideals. i cannot respect you if you lie to me, and i cannot trust you if you yourself do not recognise that you lie.  like i say, ongoing issues. but apparently they aren't important.  &nbsp; i should also like to apologise to anyone who overheard my attempt at playing the piano this evening. 'a long december' never sounded so long, i'm sure...  n.
&nbsp;  aside: you know you've done well with your lunch when the stacked sandwiches are as tall as they are wide...  as i sit planning - yes, planning - what to write i am torn as to what my actual aim is; if i am diverting then that is more than good enough, but surely i have something more to share? to this end i will attempt, from time to time,&nbsp;to expound on some of the theories i have formed about how things work. if nothing else, it will be a useful insight to the way my mind works, and how i perceive the world.  the first that comes to mind is 'leapfrogging buses', or 'how to not get infuriated on your way home'. more on that in&nbsp;a minute.  &nbsp; hold your thumb and first finger out, very close together. now, without them touching, try to move them closer. closer still. yes? now, that is how close i was to buying a polaroid instamatic camera on thursday. i saw one (two, actually, but one appeared to date from the paeleolithic era and wouldn't have looked out of place with a pin-hole) in a charity shop, and spent a good five minutes toying with the idea. i've always wanted one, that i can remember; something about the self-containment appeals to me. but i didn't buy it in the end out of respect for my ever-dire financial situation (camera = cheap; film = expensive) and also the thought that i may be mistaken for someone taking 'candid' (nudge nudge, wink wink, say no more squire) photos at home. a label i wouldn't mind so much if it was a remote possibility, but sadly not.  today's list is of things that are not really fruit but can be classed as one of the day's five portions since they are healthy: a glass of milk vitamin supplement pill opening a window taking the stairs thinking about having some fruit  its true; you know it is.  &nbsp;   leapfrogging buses: a theory.  more of an observation, really.  some simplifying assumptions:  i) all buses travel the same route, at the same driving speed. ii) all passengers are travelling to the end of the line.  iii) all distributions are normal. iv) there are no price/ticket considerations in choosing buses. v) all stops are the same duration.  (these&nbsp;will be dismissed in turn, but to illustrate the idea i've&nbsp;started it as simple as possible)  imagine there are people waiting for the bus at every stop. one bus travelling the route will stop at every stop to pick people up, and take a certain amount of time to do the run.   this is obvious; but more interesting is if there are two buses travelling next to each other. assuming i) to be valid (as is the case on my way to/from work), people will signal for the first bus, which will stop. assuming ii) to be valid, the second bus will not stop and will overtake the first. the buses have now swapped positions, and will 'leapfrog' each other down the route, stopping at  every other  stop and thus&nbsp;completing the run&nbsp;faster.  however, buses tend not to set off together; it makes no business sense. but, if iii) is valid then there will be a statistical variation on the number of people waiting for the bus at any stop at any time. in truth, the variation is not truly random but follows a certain pattern (rush hour, etc) with  an amount  of variation built-in. and if there is a variation, then we can say that v) is not valid.&nbsp;so; if we are to imagine there is, at a certain stop at a certain time, significantly more people than the mean number of people at any stop at any time(which is statistically very likely) then the solitary bus will be signalled and will have a long stop for everyone to board. this will delay that particular bus, and the next bus along the route will gain some time on it. a feedback loop is created: the first bus is taking longer to do the run since its stops are longer, this leads to a greater build-up of people at the following stops and will cause  those  stops to be longer also. the second bus may not encounter the same heavy numbers of passengers, and so will gain on the first bus, moreso as the first bus is continuing to make longer and longer stops. eventually, the second bus will catch up, and the two will begin to leapfrog.  &nbsp; so we have leapfrogging buses; if these are running faster than a single bus would, then it is conceivable, is it not, that the two would eventually catch up with any single bus ahead on the same route? bingo! three buses in a row.  assumption iv) need not be discussed heavily since people will either simply signal the first bus that comes along (which is statistically more likely to be a 'first' bus of a pre-leapfrogging pair), thus not affecting the leapfrogging behaviour,&nbsp;or will have a ticket for a certain bus&nbsp;company, which modifies the idea from being 'any bus' to 'buses of a certain company', treating each company separately.  whilst assumption ii) is not valid in the general case, it does not affect the behaviour  in the long run . also required is the possibility of there being no people waiting at the stop; all the possibilities of first bus/second bus stopping are thus:  yes/yes: no distance/order change between buses yes/no : decrease in distance between buses, possible leapfrogging no/yes: increase in distance between buses, no leapfrogging no/no:&nbsp;&nbsp;no distance/order change between buses  if all these occur randomly then their overall effect is that described earlier, to promote leapfrogging.  &nbsp;  and there we have it; my idea as to why (particularly at peak times where it is more likely that there are people at each stop) buses can bunch up in twos and threes. i have no idea if this has been postulated anywhere else; i certainly haven't looked for it. but do let me know what you think, or if i don't make sense somewhere, which is quite likely.  anyhow, i'm making chop suey. excuse me.  n.
&nbsp;  i leave the room for ten minutes, and when i come back the radio is playing 'club tropicana'. this sort of behavior must not be tolerated; i have urgently restored 'hate', by the delgados, to the cd player. hopefully the day can yet be recovered.  &nbsp; the train company wrote to me again;they say they're very sorry my train was late setting off, late arriving, and was without lighting and heating for about a third of the journey. here, have three pounds.  the thing that gets me is that they're not even doing it deliberately to make me laugh; they're actually serious. if i only had a car. oh, wait, i  do  have a car. i just can't afford the insurance. and why? because its about three times as much as the car is worth. without any no-claims bonuses, i can't afford the first year premiums, and thus will never get any no-claims bonuses. grr.  and here's the thing: if you  are  insured, and you have a crash, they put your premiums up! its like they're saying 'ah, yes, well we didn't think you'd actually  crash . we were just taking money off you; if you want to  crash  then that'll be extra.'  &nbsp; from the bus today i saw anna; i was tempted to get off and run back to talk to her but i figured my life has enough complications, and anyway last time i saw her about three weeks ago we were on the same bus and i saw her and i think she saw me, but either she didn't recognise me or wanted to appear as if she didn't. i'm putting it down to my then outrageous hair; i have too many issues to explore the more likely scenarios.  &nbsp; the five prettiest girls i have ever known (in some sort of particular order): my sister on her wedding day pink laura clare slater anna ball caroline rogers  i make no claims on personality or overall attractiveness; just prettiness. it is worth noting that i have only been out with one of them (caroline, before anyone starts), and that whilst at one point i may have ended up sharing a house with laura i never actually knew her surname. it is also worth noting that they are all very lovely people, easy to get on with, and intelligent. i guess this goes to underline that it's nigh impossible to truly separate personality and prettiness. yes...  &nbsp; (and also:&nbsp;naomi tan almost made the list. just so you know. i'm sure she's gutted.)  &nbsp; man, the delgados rule.  n.  &nbsp;
i love the british railway system; who else would write to you to let you know they are going to write to you? maybe i should write back: dear sir; thank you for your letter warning me of your impending letter; i was, however, startled to receive said advance letter without prior notice...   i ask for the complaint forms with the tickets these days; it saves time. although maybe i'm just bitter that soon i won't be considered a 'young person', and will have to forge my railcard. is it just me or is there no way&nbsp;anyone in their right mind would&nbsp;ever consider&nbsp;paying the 'full' fare? i'd want a piece of the train for that amount; the seat at least. or a section of brake cable. yeah, that'd be cool. sittin' at home, me and my brake cable...   &nbsp;  anyway. also continuing to amuse me are the details on the back of some of my calvin and hobbes books: 'not for sale in the usa or canada. humour'. although my general intolerance of all but a few americans has been piqued recently with the arrival of 400 of their footballing children. not that i blame them for their general rudeness and arrogance  per se ; when you talk to [most of] their coaches you can see where they are taking their example from.   &nbsp;  ah well. in other news, the pancakes of last night went very well, on account of good company, vanilla ice-cream and fair lashings of maple syrup. in my general non-presence of mind i neglected to buy the crate of beer i'd decided was essential, and had to fill the void with blue aftershock, which is, according to the prophecy, foul. but never mind; i can't help but think how the conversation may have turned to tripe otherwise, and i may never have postulated that the consistency of calamari lends itself to being a useful emergency scrunchy.   &nbsp;  my woody allen cd has arrived! and has much funniness contained; it still sounds fresh despite being recorded forty years ago. i find that people treat woody allen in the same way as karate (bear with me on this one); they seem to have formed an opinion without having actually sampled any first hand. and so my mission shall be to play woody allen to all my friends, and if they don't like it i'll kick them in the face. harsh, but fair.   &nbsp;  things i know a fair amount about but have never really actually properly seen:  quantum dynamics  weezer  my mind  the postal system  spike milligan   &nbsp;  i have recently moved onto the next jar of 'liberated' coffee. i am reminded of  urlLink simon , who used to be able to tell (i imagine he still can) what brand of coffee you gave him, with what milk and what type of sugar/sweetener. he didn't get out much.   &nbsp;  n.

&nbsp;  i am wondering whether the inclusion of links to stuff would enhance or detract from this blog; that was one of the problems with my old journal. people started getting clever, and being clever is the original double-edged sword. given the choice between being a popular jumping-off point or an obscure idiosyncratic, i choose the latter. i always have. mind you, that's not to say you can't combine the two; i direct you to   urlLink  greg   &nbsp;both as a good example of such, and as a hat-tipping to the guy who got me started here.     &nbsp;

let me introduce you to a place i've heard of; a place that does not exist. here, the rules of causality can be circumvented. consequence still follows action, but is no longer inextricably linked; the two can be separated. we can pay for our mistakes at our convenience, so as not to cause unnecessary suffering. imagine.  i was first introduced to this place by a dear friend of mine, who uses a love story as illustration. i keep the details deliberately vague. a boy has been with a girl for many years, and meets another girl whilst living abroad and falls in love. but it is an unknown love; the love of a few months knowing someone. and the question becomes is the chance of this one new person being the 'one' (if there is such a thing; statistics dictate otherwise, but hey) worth the irrepairable damage that will undoubtedly happen to the existing relationship? his answer, as i think most people's would be, was no.  but wouldn't you like to know? have the freedom to explore that possibility without having to hurt anyone? this is possible here. your mistakes are yours to make, and they will not inadvertantly destroy anyone else's happiness. like so many things; it probably wouldn't work, but its a nice thought experiment.    on conditional love: i can't really be doing with it. i think i should rather be loved because i have earned that love; because i am worth being loved. my body and mind are a statistical genetic result, and as such it is an accident that i am 'me'. any number of different people could have resulted. even if conception is deliberate (as is not often the case), then to be 'contractually obliged' as a parent to love the offspring regardless of their character is absolving the child of the responsibility to try to be a decent person, and absolving the parents of the responsibility to try and raise the child to be so. a responsibility i believe everyone should have: to try, at least. it is my noblest and most human characteristic that i do not consider myself to be 'enough', this is the only thing that ever pushes me to be more than i was, than i am.   n.
there is a sign in the window of the local hairdressers that says 'models required'. firstly, it occurred to me to respond to the advert; surely there is money to be made for a young lad with a passable face and a willingness to submit his hair to the whim of fashion? and then secondly, i had a much better idea: i shall hang my own of these notices in my window, and see what comes of it. models wanted.   actually, it isn't true. i am so much more content with real people, capable of conversing and, where necessary, cutting me down. girls with charm are welcome, models need not apply. i just liked the thought of it, that's all.  i am watching films recommended to me by my therapist. i am intrigued to know what his aim is, and what my reaction will be.   a historical note: 'interesting' was the last word i ever said to charlotte. i do not recall who hung up immediately after.  even as i lay dying i am certain the experience will fascinate me. my epitaph, already planned (and which i fully allow anyone to use, if they wish), will read: 'that was interesting'.   in my lifei have been guilty of many things, and innocent of many also. my wonder at the world is matched easily by my cynicism, and yet the one ever-persistent feature is fascination with the sensation of living. it is fair to say i have never felt anything like it. recently spending time with ceri reminds me of the fervour with which she embraces life, and the way with her i couldn't help but do the same. i try to remember that when the time requires it.   a downbeat post; my apologies. and it started so well. i often find that this is the way things happen. although, to be fair, often the other way too. how interesting.
seriously. don't get me started.  seriously.   well look, it's like this. i find haircuts traumatic; possibly moreso than most things in my life. if that sounds odd, consider this. i have never - ever - in my life received a haircut that i was happy with. content, even. not one. ever. i am twenty five; having been alive for a quarter of a century, how many haircuts do you suppose i have had? how many have you had? i haven't liked a single one of them. not one.   let me elaborate. haircuts are traumatic before you get anywhere near the hairdressers; it begins with people starting to tell you to get your hair cut, or more likely just making snide comments at the expansiveness of your mane. so then you decide to get it cut, and things get serious. what cut do you want? how do you want to appear to the rest of the world? i hate the idea of stepping out of the shop and declaring 'yes, i paid money to look this specific way'. and why do i hate that idea? i pay money to dress the way i do, to go the places i do, so what's the difference? ah, good question, and the answer is one of life's little secrets: hairdressers never do what you ask them to. they only ever do *what they were going to anyway*. it makes no matter what you say to them, you will only ever leave the shop when *they* are happy that you look like they want you to. we are helpless; once our hair is cut from our heads gravity takes over, and we never get it back. we are at the mercy of the hairdresser; someone, you'll note, who invariably has hair that you personally wouldn't be seen dead with. strange, that, eh? yes its true, whatever you ask for you're leaving looking 'trendy'.  or even worse, as happened to me last time: having an interview the next day i asked to look 'sensible'. i actually came out looking 'like i was in the marines'. tossers. (hairdressers, not the marines...)   and then, of course, we do the quitenessentially british thing of remarking 'oh, yes, that's fine, thank you' when asked if the cut is alright. and then: we *pay* them, when we would rather stab them in the eye with a fork. grrrr.   is it a thing with hairdressers that given their job is to cut hair, they just keep going well past the point they should stop? when i get my hair cut i indicate how much i would like taken off, and then they generally confirm by doing the hair-through-the-fingers thing. i become optimistic; they have obviously understood. so then they cut the right amount off all over my head, and i am content. and then, for no reason that i can gather other than perhaps making more work for themselves, they *do it all again*. and again.   i cannot adequately describe how genuinely depressed i get after going to the hairdressers. i sit there as they cut, and with every snip i can't help but think 'well, there goes another four weeks dedicated hair-growing'. and then i leave, and my neck gets cold. i hate it so much.   when i graduated, i paid a lot of money for a 'special graduation haircut', my attempt at ensuring looking nice for posterity. i went to town (literally, not figuratively, although i suppose the phrase came from somewhere). i made an appointment. i paid double the price i would normally expect.  i hated it. i could have saved the extra money; i could have bought a pizza. sheesh.   even talking about it makes me sad and angry. maybe i should refuse to pay. maybe i should start out by explaining exactly what i want, and letting them know i intend not to pay if they cut my hair too short. they always cut my hair too short. maybe i should stop them half way through.  i knew i should have cut it myself. i knew it i knew it i knew it.   i hate the hairdressers. i really do.

and then you keep waiting. of the two main bus companies that operate the route i use, i recently changed allegiances on the grounds of a cheaper weekly ticket and the observation that there seems to be more of that type of bus. and now i have changed? i am beginning to notice that the relative numbers of buses has radically changed. today i watched four buses of the other company roll past, and then on another occasion three, before one i could use came by. but the real killer? coming back from my old flat today, a total of nine (count 'em! nine) buses came past* before one i could use.  but it was sunny, and i was in no hurry to get to the lab....   a time-differential theory of beauty: i will only decide whether someone is attractive once i have seen how they move.   question: why does the graduate recruitment bureau send me emails exclusively in the middle of the night? is the careers office staffed by vampires? or worse, accountants?   tidying my desk at work in the next stage in my master plan ('get a phd you stupid git'); removing all those silly things i'd accumulated that wasted the space on my shelves, space that will be necessary for organising things like references and notebooks and spectra and things-that-i-don't-know-what-they-are-but-i-figure-i'd-better-not-throw-them-away-in-case-they-turn-out-to-be-important. a list of things i brought home today, then: picture frame (empty) box of diskettes (including the soft copy of my play, and xenon 2) stuffed 'the brain' toy payslip (october '03) calvin and hobbes book photo album (empty) postcards (including one of paris, one of spiderman) shotokan kata book modelling balloons (half packet) sunglasses (not trendy)   delving into my finances reveals that barclaycard are not evil, my apologies barclaycard. i shall feed you hundreds of pounds forthwith.   is astroturf eaten by astrocows?  n.

of all the foodstuffs not recommended for the just-before-bedtime slot, cheese with chilli sauce has probably got to feature somewhere near the top. and yet, i slept well enough not to remember my dreams. which might be a good thing seeing as they would likely have included ghost badgers and mott the hoople.  the new me has a newly tidy desk, it is a happy me that sits to write with a cup of herbal tea and mott the hoople.  i am hoping to receive notification today that barclaycard are evil, and that they owe me two hundred pounds. otherwise, buying food could be a problem. i am hoping to receive an apology and some freebies from ariel, since their washing tablets refuse to remove mud from my gi. i am also hoping to receive birthday cards that contain thousands of pounds, but i figure this is unlikely. i'll settle for love.   cds i need to buy: ash - meltdown red hot chili peppers - blood sugar sex magik jeff buckley - grace nick drake - five leaves left maroon 5 - songs about jane mercury rev - all is dream muse - absolution   and so many others, after looking at si's collection. damn those with disposable income.  food i went to buy yesterday: milk and bread actual cost of what i bought: Â£9.87  hmmm.  and onwards.  n.
the loan adverts that are currently plaguing the television annoy me; i have begun to see the pattern they follow:  i) having trouble paying bills? ii) problems getting loans elsewhere? iii) reduce your monthly payments! iv) take your family on holiday, or buy a new kitchen! v) call now.   stripped down, this essentially becomes: having trouble coping? ignore it!  this is a strategy i am familiar with. the flaw is a basic one: if you're having trouble with bills and the such; stop taking loans out! loans = more to pay back. it has to; otherwise how does it work, and why are there so many companies offering it? the rationale is bizarre, and only works because of fear. this is, essentially, the hard sell, in our own homes. i don't want to play any more.   recent ringtones that surprised: scotland the brave.   time spent down in london village at the weekend have lent some direction to my current thoughts; advice and consultation with old and older friends is refreshing. i've needed to get out of this head for a while; fortunately, pimm's in the backyard sunshine are a good help to getting out of your head. the gathering became the party, the party became the barbecue, and the barbecue eventually gave way to an impromptu concert of irish folk and the schubert.   happy birthday, si.   which brings me to my own impending quarter century, which promises to bring with it nothing special. more age; i already have all i want. so far my years of adult life have offered no indication of a stable and/or happy life to come; i am no closer to a decision about what any of this means. i am continually grateful of those that have given me their time, but i am always scared they will (in the end) decide it wasn't worth it.  [insert oblique reference to failed relationships of the past]   more positive notes regard my apparent optimism in the face of the things that bring me down. i am recognising the patterns. there are always patterns. i no longer resent the light that brings the sun at its centre so maybe the drugs are working, and now it is time to ask myself to do the same.  n.
if lack of sleep leads to an involuntary lowering of defences, then therapy this morning indirectly benefitted. i was (quote) more open (unquote) than i have ever been before; whether this is also related to the subject matter (relationships past) is open for further thought.  then to the charity shops, where i am dismayed to find oxfam is currently re-shelving its book section, but cheered to find the following tucked away in cancer research uk:  the illustrated woody allen reader - woody allen the essential difference - simon baron-cohen the meaning of it all - richard feynman   any of these, after paul auster, will be light relief. and then to the shops to spend another fortune on ready meals and oranges. food parcels gladly accepted as long as they contain no curry or citrus fruit. and to close, a note from today's horoscope: 'if you want something, get out there and get your hands on it.' you have been warned!  n.
prozac does not work. go figure.   there have been incidents recently that have cheered me (you know who you are) and infuriated me (you know damn well who  you  are), but i can't help but wonder if that would have happened anyway. the worst is not really knowing; its been a few months now and i thought i had improved a little, but now i'm not so sure. if my mood is changeable anyway, then surely we need some sort of definite correlation between times of medication and times of better living? i'm a scientist, dammit; i need proof. i may ask to come off the pills at my next review; perhaps risky, but perhaps not. in my quieter moments i wonder what i have to lose.   this sounds terrible; and i must apologise to those who have recently made me so glad to be alive, and to those who will worry needlessly. but there have been certain words and actions, the effects of which i have understated, that have thrown me into confusion again. and worse, i am no longer sure of even recording these thoughts here for fear of the audience i have become aware of. a sad thing, to live in fear; to take another's game so seriously. i did what you asked, i would have hoped that would be enough.  i am curious to know what you were thinking, and i am almost sure i'm entitled to an explanation. i think i could maybe ask, but consider this: you so often have proved me wrong in what i think, the question regrettably becomes more complicated. you think i overreact; i am amazed i am so calm. if something doesn't matter to you then you must concede you are probably the poorer judge of how it should be handled?  the morning is well upon me. i think i will go and have a conversation with the memory of you before sleep and daylight successively save me.   n.
i have cracked spider solitaire. last week i came up with a method of defeating it, and i haven't lost a game since. some are taking a long time and are decidely tricky, but i've completed every single one. now, everyone knows i normally only do the medium difficulty one, but today i tried a game on the hard setting. i completed it. convinced?  i guess the first thing to note is that unlike conventional solitaire,  every frame can be beaten . an obvious statement, perhaps, but important, i think. i developed the idea on the two-suit variety, and i haven't done it rigorously, but i hope you'll get the idea. general principles, then.   i) always keep a spare cell when you can. this is the most useful space since anything can be put there. always work to be making a new spare cell; the more the better.  ii) keep a track on colour (or suit) changes; the less, the better. always use a spare cell to swap out matching suits if you can. before a new row fill the spare cells to give lesser numbers of changes in the board.  iii) clean runs of the same suit can be treated as a single card; runs of different suits are therefore broken down into that many single cards.  iv) if you have many of one card value, then try to keep them exposed as little as possible by not moving non-running cards on top of them.  v) using two free spaces, simple runs of different suits can be moved using the  urlLink tower of hanoi  principle.  vi) completing a suit and removing it can never be a bad thing since it does not alter the ratio of unmatched 'useful' and 'unuseful' cards.  vii) stacking up suit-changing runs isn't a bad thing; it helps to free spare cells which are more useful in the end. it is common (on the medium setting) to be able to complete two suits before needing the first new row using this idea.   but, most importantly, and the key to the whole issue, is that  you have to remove the element of chance  from the game. if you rely on luck, there is a good chance you will be beaten. if you want to beat the game every time you have to sacrifice the honour of playing an honest game. (it is up to you whether you consider this worthwhile, or 'in the spirit of the game'; i started doing it to investigate whether each frame is possible. it is possible that each frame is possible in a number of ways, but i'm not sure how to show this). i call this 'the riley method'; and basically it means being ruthless, and  never  giving up. the key to this is the 'undo' function. if something doesn't look like its working out, go back. try something else. you can undo back to the last suit-removal or new row, and often you'll need to try a few different approaches. mostly, the objective is to complete another suit, but beware that this can scupper you if you've filled all the spare cells, so be careful.   overall, then, i can't say this will guarantee you success. i've been playing cards since i was little and i've built up a good understanding of cardplay, and i have a fairly mathematical brain to start with. but i thought i'd mention it; if only to explain what i've been doing with my time. i'd be interested to hear any comments anyone has; and again i haven't looked to see if anyone has written about this before, i prefer working the puzzle myself.   list of puzzles i that i looked up the answer for:  urlLink the morris sequence  (my favourite sequence puzzle ever)  urlLink rubik's clock  (well, lee dicks told me because he's an arrogant bastard but i'd showed no signs of getting the answer myself)  there are probably others.  n.
an interesting weekend.  no, let me put it differently. a great weekend. an outstanding weekend. made so by the presence of a certain scouser that has been decidedly missing from my life of late. whilst the reunion wasn't everything i'd hoped for, i do concede that sometimes clothes  are  necessary...  a trip to liverpool brings back many memories, all of them good, and adds many more besides. promises to go again soon are much less than idle, i assure you. returning to manchester on saturday with alex in hand, so to speak, we are able to catch up on months of pointless chattering, which is always good. having to fulfil a promise i made a long time ago (under duress, i'm sure), i dug out the magic box and did some tricks; the reaction i got makes me wonder why i ever gave it up. well, maybe i didn't, really. just a change of emphasis. i couldn't help but be amused that the patter was all still there in my head; maybe my childhood wasn't so wasted after all. some of the shows we did! completely daft, but they've got to be some of my favourite times. those days we were indestructible; we could do anything, so we did. not such a bad way of living.  they say that you can have too much of a good thing, and the takeaway pizza almost had the better of me, but i outwitted it in the end. with the intention of getting horrendously drunk we then proceeded to get dressed for the night out; i put some shoes on, whilst maria and alex proceeded to try everything on twice, straighten their hair (i idly did a bit of my fringe but succeeded only in looking like i was from  urlLink franz ferdinand ), put contact lenses in, and lord knows what else (i wasn't allowed in the room, no matter how nicely i asked). turns out that the two of them are exactly the same size in clothes, which is both convenient and a little worrying. apparently they got ready in remarkably quick time. apparently.  any concerns i had about it getting too late for us to become entirely inebriated were soon put to rest with our arrival at  urlLink kro bar , where we swiftly ordered the strawberry beer we'd been looking forward to. finding ceri and some assorted chemists also at the bar was a bonus, and with the addition of gargantuan paul made a decent eight. and there we stayed until closing, whereupon we sauntered to the inestimably groovy big hands. ceri's admirable figure and sharp eyes getting us entry discount and a table respectively, it all worked out very well indeed. as we proceeded to drink and shoot the distinct lack of breeze, and on the promise of some frankly lewd behaviour (yet to materialise; i should have got it written down, dammit) i repeated the elastic band trick a couple of times. the principle of never repating a trick can be bent slightly with the addition of alcohol, i find. discussions of kung fu and swaying to the sounds of  urlLink manu chao  give way  to me being told that i am gay 'because i know cat's cradle'. hmmm, and you think they'd be impressed that you could do it with elastic bands. and so, into the night air, and bus rides addressing urgent questions: are we going to bed now, or are we not?  not. instead we are to go to maria's to collect wine (and for paul to steal stella from the fridge, leaving four pounds and the note 'have nicked your stella, buy yourself a palace') and to go 'ssssh!' very loudly, before back to mine to talk about... erm... well anyway, it was good.   sunday morning is true studenthood; a rota system was set up for maria, alex and i to use the shower, the single bowl, and single mug. the idea of simply sharing each one in turn was mooted; but optimism is a good thing, y'know? being thoroughly exhausted and all resting on the single bed together, the look on greg's face when he came to knock on the window was priceless. 'this never happens in my room!' he says, mock-seriously. i feel no compulsion to explain the decidedly less exciting truth of the matter; i just smile and leave the illusion. that's showbiz.  n.
well now. please excuse my absence, and also the fact that in the near future i may not be around so much. there was this thing, you see, and there was an issue, and so we all moved and we're not there any more. and i'm so tired of running around being responsible that i shan't say much more.  urlLink greg , less uprooted than myself, has written an account of the last couple of days. all i shall say is: no internet connection is losing, secretly stealing illegal mini-fridge for personal use is winning.  in other news i now have my mouse up and running, and it is lovely. i am also considering buying an inexpensive digital camera to supplement this here site with illustrations of exactly what the hell i'm talking about. you have been warned.   on monday night, as i lay awake before the onslaught of the day to come and during the onslaught of the rain which surely played its part, i got to thinking of a story from my past that i should like to share. the reason i thought of it was my (by now usual) insomnia, and all those fruitless efforts people make to try to sleep when their body (albeit ready to drop) is having none of it.  secondary school; before i gave up my childish dreams of doing something i wanted in life, i took a GCSE in drama. part of this course was taken by a large, somewhat sweaty man called george cockroft, who looked not a little like  urlLink john mccririck . which, thinking back, is a bit weird. i liked him a lot; he was an intelligent man who (for all i know on the subject) taught us well. but there is one lesson that still stays with me: in the drama studio (a big room that could be blacked out, essentially) one time he had the entire class of around twenty five lay flat on our backs, completely relaxed, whilst all the lights were turned out. and as we lasy there in the dark (the giggling subsided eventually) he began to talk to us, taking us through a systematic relaxation of our bodies. it was amazing; i think over half of us fell asleep, and the rest of us had never been so still. i still use the same technique today; and with discipline, it works.  at the end of the fifth year, when we had taken our exams and all was done, mr cockroft was leaving the school. and i remember one day (it may have been sports day), a beautifully sunny day, being outside on the field and having a brief talk with him. i imagine i said something like how much i'd enjoyed the drama course, and doing the plays, and the such. i imagine he said something like he was glad i'd enjoyed it, etc. and then i said something like 'so, i'm not sure when i'll see you again', and i remember him looking at me in a mysterious, almost mischievious way (this man was about fifty-five, i reckon), and saying 'oh, i think it'll be sooner than you think...'   i never saw him again.  n.
the humidity of recent days has lead to increased insomnia, but has also lead to the first five minutes of returning home into a game of how fast the vast majority of my clothes can be removed. right now i am wearing only the shorts that earned me the name of 'chicken legs' earlier this year. maybe it is something about this room that tends the occupant towards nudity?  but i have done well today; visiting town for the briefest time i have bought a mouse for purely rational. as much as i like the trackpad, it is time for seriousness. seriosity, if you will.  serioucism?  anyway; the online delivery charge of 30% of the mouse's worth causing the trip to town, i was pleased to quickly find the one i wanted on the shelf. in a cylindrical-type packaging, admittedly very fetching, there was no information as to whether the software is on cd or diskette. i asked the man in the shop 'is the software on cd for this mouse?'. i held up the mouse i meant. 'oh yes', he said.  let me tell you now, he is a lying swine.  so now i have no immediate way of loading my mouse driver. purely rational has no floppy drive ( it is a laptop of the  future , and besides i couldn't be bothered to pay for an extrenal drive). my old laptop  does  have a floppy drive, but it doesn't have a cd burner. nor does it have a modem or network plug. or usb ports. (it is a laptop of the  past , and besides, it was free). in fact, of their 26 assorted ports and things, there is  no way whatsoever  that i can make the two machines talk to each other in the way i would like without buying some extra (read: 'expensive') hardware. shocking. anyway, i've arranged for it to be done now. but ergh, it annoys me. i might write a snotty letter to dixons (no link because they are evil evil lying swine, although they offer cordless optical mice at affordable prices) and hope they send me  urlLink something cool .   new cd: welcome interstate managers, by fountains of wayne. very good.   stopping by the supermarket on the way home to spend a fortune (Â£14) on my continued survival, it is interesting to note the hastily-erected shelving selling umbrellas. in august? sheesh. i pick up some essentials (bread, milk), some healthy things (oranges, tomatoes), and some random bits (stir-fry sauce, biscuits). i have recently taken to swiss-style meusli, that is to say meusli with raisins, nuts, and no extreme political views.  i resent paying over  urlLink 50p  for a loaf of bread; sure it tastes nicer but seeing as i never get through a loaf fast enough to avoid throwing the last three or four slices away (as i did this morning). i am now trying 'stays fresher longer' bread, 44p. i have high hopes; except i have doubt about the grammar. shouldn't it be 'stays  fresh  longer', or just 'stays fresher'? or am i too worried about my bread?   the last thing to mention today is the post office; and some interesting distinctions in the british postal service. i am sending a friend a cd, and i am enclosing a brief letter with it. if i send it as a 'small package', it is cheaper than sending it letter-rate. imagine you are sending someone a book; if you send it on its own it is a small package and can be sent (relatively) cheaply. if, however, you enclose a 'letter' with it, then as far as the post office is concerned the  entire weight  of the parcel is your letter, and you are charged accordingly. but what constitutes a 'letter'? for the small package rate you are allowed to enclose a brief letter which references only the item you are sending. so, if you write 'dear jeff, here is the copy of  three men in a boat  i promised, hope you enjoy it' then no problem. but write 'dear jeff, here is the copy of  three men in a boat  i promised, hope you enjoy it. little malcolm fell off his bike yesterday...' then pow! you have just (according to the postal service) written a comic novel. so if they ask you if there's a letter inside when you're at the counter, you know what to say. and you too can make sure you're sending things as cheaply as possible, even if it does mean you have to write (as i do) 'small package' on everything you send...   nmrboy's currently favoured dinner: pasta (enough for 2, cooked) cheese (small cubes of) cooked ham (diced) tomato (1, raw, chopped) olive oil ( extra  virgin, whatever that means) basil (not a siberian hamster)  all mixed round together, serve hot and frequently. food = good; or at least its the most similar word you can form with a standard 'qwerty' keyboard. coincidence? well, probably...  n.
a slow day; getting things done like cutting your toenails tend not to count as truly productive, they are to the working day as shampoo is to the shopping list: something that occasionally has to be done, but more of an imposition than anything else.  thesis word count: 650  like i say, a slow day. but, i have been having some fairly interesting thinks. i mean thoughts.  i) truth: if everything we know or learn is (necessarily) brought to us by our own perception, then it doesn't matter whether there is any absolute truth because we will never know it.  ii) labels: labels on relationships only serve to give rise to expectations of certain behaviour; expectations drawn from the media, demographic ensembles and hearsay that can never realistcally be matched by any random (that is to say non-specific) individual. this mis-matching of expectation with reality (regardless of how perfect the reality) leads to disappointment and eventually conflict. the need to categorise things is an outward desire, and serves no purpose to the individuals involved, who will tend to know what's going on. the driving force is to have a neat labelled pigeon-hole-type box for the relationship that others will understand with the minimum of explanation; but if every relationship (an analogue quantity if every there was one) is forced into one of any number of discrete boxes (digital classification) then the fit will never ne perfect (analogue-to-digitl conversion, and information is irrevocably lost). its just  laziness , that's all. pisses me off that people can break up over such an unnecessary thing.  iii) gravy boats and gravy trains. no gravy planes.  iv) language: when was the last time anyone described themselves to you as 'hot' or 'cold', instead of 'really hot' or 'really cold' (or the like)? language is something that people invented, and yet they don't use it properly? if words have definitions, and we can invent new words with appropriate definitions as needs be, then why isn't language sufficient to expess what we want to say? and if it  is  sufficient, then why don't we use it properly? this follows a conversation i had recently, which went roughly as follows:  ros: i guess that depends on what you mean by 'happy'. guil: the oxford english dictionary defines it as 'feeling or showing pleasure or contentment'. ros: yeah, well i wouldn't define it  that  way.  anyone else find that amusing/frustrating? mind you, to get technical, i guess it depends how you define 'definition'. or something.   enough thoughts! i should get out more.  v) i should get out more.   todays's list is of synonyms for 'list': bank careen heel incline lean slant slope tilt tip   n.
terrestrial british television is currently enjoying the simultaneous playing of great films: 2 has pulp fiction, 3 has unbreakable, and 4 has the shawshank redemption. we shall say nothing of red heat on 1, or the over-stylised american cop series on 5.  i hate moths. and wasps and flies and all those buzzy things that annoy me late at night. they fully deserve my attacking them with my  bokken , oh yes.   a very serious thing has happened; today i realised that  urlLink charlotte 's birthday has passed without my noticing. an indication of something? a milestone? perhaps neither, but certainly noteworthy. happy birthday, charlie.   the time has come to abandon my life in favour of what i must do. my friends, the phd has begun. not an auspicious start, it being four months or so too late, but it has begun all the same. i shall keep you updated. unfortunately, it will mean less time for finding bizarre but wonderful things like  urlLink this , but that is the price i must pay. for all the analysis is helping me understand my own mind and those of others, it is worthy to note that the solution of problems still comes down to just 'getting on with it'.   thesis word count: 404  more to come.  n.
it seems that i am a difficult person to get hold of; or so i have been recently told by more than a couple of people. the main downside to (gasp) not having a mobile telephone was brought back to me today when it transpires that my best friend tried to call last night, and i wasn't around. unfortunate rather than malicious, but i'm still a little sad about it. especially since i was erely over in the common room, chain-watching buffy the vampire slayer until three in the morning. sorry, chief.  and as to the advice i can give you? its all guesswork, i'm afraid. there is no greater mystery than the intricacies of  urlLink women .   commenting on the heat (32 degrees! and not fahrenheit, you picky lot) in his office, he notes that he is becoming the incredible sweating man; and between us we decide that this would make a better arch-nemesis than super-hero. homeostasis as a way of fighting crime? hmm...   and yes, i measaured the bread. but i only did it roughly (to establish its non-squareyness), since presumably there is a variation in each slice, and trying to find the mean and standard deviation would just be silly. no, really. and what was the greatest thing before sliced bread? and when they made the first sliced loaf, did it have an even number of slices so making sandwiches was more convenient? what would they do with the last slice? and were the sparrows fatter?  all important questions, i'm sure you'll agree.   also catching my eye just yesterday was the notices around the lake (i use the word loosely) in our nearby park; reading danger: deep water, and danger: thin ice. now surely thin ice is only a danger because of the deep water beneath it? well, i suppose you could slip over, but i'm not sure that's what the sign is getting at. surely the sign should read:  danger: deep water danger: thin ice danger: gravity   i think this could also be applied to other situations:  danger: cliff face danger: gravity  danger: sharp bend danger: newton's  urlLink first law of motion    you get the idea. i will undoubtedly have something else to say at some point; but for now, i think tea and toast is the way forward. breakfast is, after all, the most important meal of the day. that's why i have it three times a day.  n.
but before we start:   urlLink http://www.bewitched.com/m/    urlLink http://www.turbulence.org/Works/song/    things that have distracted me today are things that claim to be things they are not:  mansize kleenex (294 mm x 272 mm) sony walkman (inanimate) 'amazing shine' hair wax (moderately impressive at best) B&G no. 1 picture hook (quantity: 8) clothes horse (demonstrably not a horse) kingsmill square bread (120 mm x 110 mm) hotmail - 'more useful every day'   n.
night is the worst; its when i wander more, when sounds seem louder, and when i still find time to talk to her memory. she is gone, appropriately through time (4 years? 5?) and space (some hundred miles, sometimes thousands), and yet the closest i get to someone understanding me at these times is to imagine her still here.  aside: i suppose sounds seem louder at night due to a simple comparison with other noise present, ie there is less background at night. the same way the moon seems larger when it is close to the horizon, for direct comparison with everyday objects?  i think too much. see? night is the worst.  n.
what an entertaining morning! after the insights of therapy and the delight of having already had a shower (joy!), i headed off to the shortest film festival in the world (...ever!). this is run by the people at  urlLink nokia  who want you to buy their 'phones, and are selling them on the basis of their movie-making features. there are nine films, and all are less than fifteen seconds long. intriguing, yes? you can watch them on that link, if you like, but i nipped down to a local cinema to watch them on the big (ish) screen: a cinema with a small bench seat, the whole thing measuring 2 cubic metres. my favourite is, i think, 'the divorce', by a matt bloom. check it out.  more important though, and something i'm taking as some sort of sign, was one of the girls manning the booth was absolutely stunning; a becky jago-alike if ever i saw one. i'm tempted to go back. with a camera. and a better hairstyle. this sets me thinking about beauty again; clearly an important subject in my head. how can the simple existance of someone as pretty as [should have asked her name, dammit] cheer me up for the day? we shared nothing except the most trivial of conversation. what is at work here? most curious. what is worst of all is that on account of her face (okay, teeth mainly. and nice eyes.) i am actually going to go to the website to enter the competition to win the damn 'phone! i am being manipulated by someone, and what annoys me is that its probably me.   on the way home i stopped off at the charity shops and managed to pick up the new york trilogy, by paul auster (i can hear a certain  urlLink grey kitty  meowing at that one), for a mere one english pound and forty-nine pennies. i liked 'the invention of solitude', so i have high hopes (although not for happy endings....). in the same shop i also bought something eponymous by 'the for carnation' whom i have never heard of. a six track cd, with each track lasting over five and a half minutes, it will surely be value for money. what tipped the scales, however, was the tiny sleeve note announcing vocals on one of the tracks by a certain rachel haden, of  urlLink that dog  fame. fame? oh, alright then, but she's done backing vocals with  urlLink weezer  and jimmy eat world, and that's good enough for me.   other news is that the solid block of sugar that has been threatening to fall out of my sugar tin finally did so into one the most enjoyable cups of coffee i've had in a while, i am almost out of maple syrup on account of eating popcorn for most meals, and i have been thinking about happiness some more.   a hello to cathy; who can be beaten at minesweeper but is yet to crumble under the onslaught of my charm offensive. her hopes of having a starring role in this entry were scuppered by an unfortunate typo, and so now she is left with a  urlLink staring  role.  hee hee!   clocks in my rooms, and the times they show: wall clock: 1512 silver watch: 1245 purely rational (my computer) : 1639 digital watch: 1640 VCR: 0000 (blinking) alarm clock: 1639 other alarm clock: 1642 pocket watch: 1046 dress watch: 1331   i think this explains a lot; although not my love of punctuality..  n.
and no, i'm not talking about the incessant rain. i actually like the rain; the seven-month manchester winter of grey and mizzle is part of the appeal. i guess i just like wearing coats, and to quote the  urlLink otters : the rain soothes the tempest that is my soul.  at my therapist's this morning we identify patterns that lead to my (quote) deviousness (unquote), and we learn exactly why it is that my mother (quote) pisses me off (unquote). i am sure that this is progress. on the way out, i pick up a leaflet for  urlLink calm , an organisation i fully support through my general apathy. the leaflet says 'suicide is the biggest killer amongst men aged from 15-35 years old. it accounts for 21% of all deaths among this age group in britain. this phenomenon, which started in the 1970s, is echoed across europe, the us and australia'. this is, i think you'll agree, quite startling. is does raise the question as to why men started killing themselves in the seventies? i blame fashion.  also, the telephone lines are open from 5pm to 3am, every day. these hours lead to two obvious conclusions: i) the miserable also need to sleep ii) men only become miserable after watching  newsround , which is understandable since the departure of the delectable  urlLink becky jago .   at eleven in the morning i am delighted to say i have already had four of the recommended five portions of fruit. they are: 1 bowl muesli (i avoided being pulled in by the strong currants) 2 satsumas 1 apple   i have been musing on happiness; i will return.  n.
i never figured on any of this; that much you should know. whatever else happens, and whatever i am yet to be guilty of, i can't say that i planned it.  look, from time to time i'm a sensible kind of guy. i know i'll probably never be to you what i would like to be. i know it was just a result of your circumstances that made things the way they were, and now they've changed and everything has to settle down again. i guess i just wanted to put it down somewhere that i'm glad that i was lucky enough to be in the wrong place at the right time. i'm glad that i was able to glimpse something so much more than me.  n.
the well-meaning drunk: oh, sure, their heart's in the right place, and i'm glad he stopped by to apologise for all the noise and such, but at half four in the morning there are better things i can think of doing. and i know he was drunk, but his admission that they'd 'been a bit hard on me' was both pleasant and unexpected.  late night becomes early morning, and television becomes something else entirely. apparently doctor richard kimble is still on the run, and is these days looking like a poor man's gary sinise. this week he escaped by going out a window; genius.  on the subject of naff television, friday's episode of charlie's angels had one of them go undercover at a women's prison. initially set upon by the top dog (so to speak), she later gains a friend by rescuing a drowning woman from the swimming pool, and goes on to meet her contact in the massage parlour. this a  prison , yes? swimming pools and massage parlours? that's more facilities than a lot of hotels, and, well, wales.   quote of the day is me, on possible pick-up lines whilst 'cruising the toaster': 'i like my toast like i like my women: white, thick and inexpensive...'   and a hello to sarah, our illustrious treasurer, who will surely be the best we have ever had: her arrangement of my alphabetical fridge magnets was precisely that: alphabetical. she just can't help it; and whilst it is undoubtedly a useful trait, its also very funny.  today's list is songs i try to play/sing on the piano: radiohead - fake plastic trees radiohead - karma police the boo radleys - wilder counting crows - a long december the bluetones - a parting gesture ben folds five - eddie walker ben folds five - evaporated  all good songs, even if my voice just isn't up to some of it. like that ever stopped me.  n.
quote of the day is good even out of context:  'there are things you don't do. like your nieces.'  thanks, greg.   i've been neglecting the blog of late, not through intention but through a combination of distraction and not really being sure of what to say. the days have been a mass of getting nothing done and sleeping in varying amounts of fitfulness. maybe this has lead to a time where i have nothing to say; the blogger page has lain open on my computer for many many hours, waiting but unsatisfied.  a meagre list; again of girls. they are, after all, what make any story worth telling. and so: girls that have been away and are returning to my life:  alex (4 months) ro (1 month) helen (12 months) rachael (12 months)   and they expect me to get any work done?  n.
So many things I could talk about today. Didn't get to talk to my Daddy, left him a message though. Spent the day with minime asking where her Dad was and why he was taking so long to see her. But made her smile and feel special no matter what. Talked to a few people today, old friends, new friends, special people.  I am sooooooo proud of my friend Sean for his marathon run today!! YAY!!!! I better get my butt in gear and get back in shape or I will never keep up hahaha.  So I was thinking (yeah yeah today I actually DID think) the whole concept of good karma and reaping what you sow. If energy can never be destroyed..maybe the actual energy generated while you are doing something for others is released somehow into the ether and one day will cause a positive reaction in someone else that eventually gets back to you. Likewise the bad energy too...meh...never know huh? Was an interesting thought though. I think I will eat something really bad for me now so I can have freaky dreams and write another interesting blog in the morning... MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!  Cheers!
when I was hanging out with Dino. We were talking about the higher quality of Greek leather...well he was I was pretending I thought he was right. He was going on about how they make good belts. ( I think he had been awake for something like 49 hours at this point meeting a work deadline ) I was thinking 'Yannow...I have heard about a lot of things from Greece don't think belts were in that list' Sometimes I think...nahhhhhh I NEVER think...muahahahahahaaa. Holy molaaaaay I need more coffee or a brain or a Greek Belt?  Cheers

Ugh finally the only show worth watching on TV has come along. The WB's Superstar USA, ooooh man I LOVE that show. An underhanded and mean reality show that takes AWFUL singers who think they are good and lets them howl on international TV. The cast members they chose were perfect Tone-Loc, Vitamin C and a guy named Briggs. Their acting ability to sit there and pretend to be loving people singing like cats in a blender in indeed impressive. So they take them to Hollywood give them makeovers and let them sing..badly. The final 4 were well chosen Jo-Jo who told people it was his 'gah-dunk-a-dunk' that made him star material. (that means his butt for those not in the know **wink**) Mario who must weigh all of 90 pounds soaking wet and looks like the kids who used to get shoved in lockers in high school. Jaime the obligatory blonde bimbo with more cup size than cranium size. Rosa the latina firecracker who lives in her own lil world and was probably the worst singer there. I do have to admire all the entertainers confidence in themselves albeit a lil misguided. I missed the last show because someone special was getting her swimming badge and have tried to find more info on how the show went down. A few comments here and there online only to find that JAIME WON!!! UGHHHH!!! NOOOOOOO!!!! For gawd sakes do we NOT have enough female pop-TARTS out there these days?? Yes her looks will sell her to the male audiences even if she can't sing. I think we needed someone like Mario to give all those male singers a run for their pec and chin implants. Rosa well....yeah the worst singer but she didn't have the spark and she can't shake it like J-Lo and Aguilera. Jo-Jo was just too sweet I think, or too simple....I dunno one or the other. Apparently it works for a woman but not for a man. Yay Jaime you have just become a part of the machine that is stardom,but for the love of all that is sacred someone give her cue cards so she can stop writing lyrics on her hands!!!  Cheers!
We always hear statistics stating we are an aging nation, but how does that really affect us? All the advances in health care and medicine have people who might not have otherwise survived living till their 80's and 90's. A couple thousand years ago 30 really was middle age and 60 was as old as 90 is today. Always searching for the youth, the secret of eternal life....dealing with a whole other area of medicine that will become the focus of all our healthcare dollars even more so...'Geriatrics' I love my lil grandma dearly but it is so hard to watch her age, she was born in 1918 the year Influenza B swept across North America and killed so many. Indeed her own mother became very ill when my grandma was only a few months old. Grandma was sent to stay with Aunt Lizzie till her Ma was better. She managed to stay well through that. She also managed to survive as one of the middle children in a family of 9 kids. In a house with no running water. I think about how my child will never know what it's like to have to live with an outhouse and baths in the kitchen(well those ones in the sink when she was 6 months old were cute hehe). My grandma married a man 12 years her senior whom was the love of her life....brought 4 kids into this world on Dairy Farms. Worked hard..watched her family grow...watched my grandfather grow more and more ill after he retired and take care of him like a nurse after his many strokes. He passed away in 1988 and she has never even considered another man. Then her energy was directed back to her kids and grandkids, and most importantly her garden. That woman has more strength and courage than most of the people I know. And as I watch her health start to fail at the age of almost 86...I find myself dealing with the one of the hard truths of life. We all will die one day. So I am not sure if I am more upset at the fact she will not be here forever...or the fact that I won't. I need coffee...Cheers!
There are days it seems i have to much to say and no one to say it to. Sometimes my ideas seem profound, sometimes just plain funny....maybe getting it all out there and have someone stumble across them and maybe laugh, maybe cry, maybe learn something...might be a good idea. Or I can just pretend people actually are interested in my errant rantings now and then. So I raise a glass of....hrmm...water? and say Cheers!  Webi
that's what I would truly like to beeeeeee. Cause if I were an Oscar Mayer wienerrrrrrrr....everybody'd be in love with me.   I treated myself today to some dresses, I felt so gross the last week. I realized I had only one really 'pretty' dress..I am a girl I guess I can act like one once in a while instead of feeling like I have to be some plain non descript blending into the crowd figure. I'd like to be able to look in the mirror and say 'Daaaamn I look GOOD!' and really think it. For all my bravado about not caring what other people think about my looks...I need to be less critical about what I think of them. I know the really good stuff is on the inside, I know how to love, I know how to care, I know how to make others feel appreciated...But I live in a culture that has ingrained into my being this myth about beauty. I did some reading a few nights about about body image and older civilizations...dammit if I lived in the time of Reuben...I'd be a SuperModel...lol. We are taught young to find fault with ourselves...our lack of looking like that less than 1% of women who actually do model. I still find it so bizarre they use women we can never be instead of the women we are to sell us things. There would be something self satisfying to see more women just like us model...or models chosen on the basis of their deeds...cause in the end it's how good you WERE not how good you LOOKED.   &nbsp;  I had more to say but I got distracted, so yeah then I guess I am done for now.   Cheers!   &nbsp;   &nbsp;
that's all i want to say to youuuuu.  &nbsp;  Ok maybe not just that. I got a lot done today, fever seems to be almost gone. Had most of the day to myself which was kind of nice. Did some yard work,a lot of&nbsp;cleaning, some resting...then got a phone call that my precious was not comfy where she was having a sleep over and wanted to come home. That's ok though we can try another time.  &nbsp;  I'm a little nervous about going back to work, but I still have a bit more time. I will go back to needing to catch up on so much and take account for the time and targets I missed. I think it's going to be ok, I feel like i have a better sense of purpose now. Maybe I just need to get primal and kill that fear. Funny how a slight change in the way you perceive something can shift you to a whole other view.&nbsp; Although I don't think being painted up in tribal colors and jumping on the desks will go over well at work...ooooh wait that's right METAPHORICAL...lol  &nbsp;  Ok I am done..nothing else to say today.  &nbsp;  Cheers  &nbsp;
I am a candle burning bright, to light your way on darkest nights Your path you choose, You take your steps I hold your hand along the way, and raise you up from broken wings You find your voice, You sing your song I hear your soul, and sing along &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  um yeah it was there waiting...now it is in words
so much and so much and so much...  I am happy that I have started to take the time to learn more about why and how I react to things.  Accept a challenge now and then, learn from how I react to them too. And through all of it....remember I can do anything I set my mind to. I have felt like there were times in my life when I dragged myself with my finger nails to get through...but hey...whatta ya know?!?! I made it...and I will keep moving forward. I can feel the energy in the core of my being, maybe I should try to bask in it more often.   I have so many thoughts on so many different topics today. I can say this, BRING IT!   Cheers!
I was thinkin back to a poem I wrote a while ago, thought I had saved a copy...and now can't find it...I am going to try to get it back out of the deep recesses of my brain though. Too bad it never found it's way to anyone who appreciated it though lol.  If Time was a River  If time was a river that flowed to the sea And love was the vessel that would carry me I'd pack it with patience with laughter with care with passion and friendship and take some to spare If time was a river that flowed to the sea And love was the vessel that would carry me I'd need someone steadfast to be on my crew And if I had get to choose, I plan to choose you   Ok that's not exactly the original but not bad if I do say so myself. I should dig up my old poems and get them on the blog...might be good for trip down my dark and twisted memory lane.  I was actually missing work today, but know I am not ready to go back just yet. A couple more weeks and I should feel better able to face the world head on again. It's been nice to just kind of see where the day takes me, but then I think about all those people I am not getting to help. I sometimes shake my head at the apathy so many of my co-workers have...then again so many people in the world are apathetic. When I get to hear 'wow thank you soooo much why has no one ever taken that time to explain this to me?' or 'You are a dear you took all my worries away' at least I know for the few minutes that person talked to me they felt like someone, somewhere cared about who they were and what they needed. Someone told me I had too much to give one time, isn't that what it's about though?? You give of yourself to the right people...and they give back to you...not rocket science yannow? Or give the right things to the right people. I almost wonder if it takes a stronger person to accept that you deserve to be given back to...instead of feeling like you constantly are going to 'owe' something to someone.   Cheers!
Sometimes when you look for something so hard you don't see that what you need might be right in front of you. We all live with perceptions...about ourselves, others, the world..spend a lot of time classifying the same. In the pursuit of all things wonderful we forget the wonder in what we already have. Nothing is sweeter than realizing that old adage...it's not having what you want...it's wanting what you have.  I'm taking time for me for a change, and it is not an easy thing. I am so used to being many things to many people. But what I keep getting told is that if I don't take care of me first my efforts are pretty much wasted. Funny after 33 years to be told my expectations of myself are too high...when I have thought I just wasn't trying hard enough. Ah if only...if only what I don't know...but...ahhh if only.  I love finding the beauty and art in everything...the way the sun shines through the leaves on my apple tree just so. The brilliant diamond sparkles as it dances across the water in the pool. The flowing motion of the ripples across the pool as a giggling child spins around as fast as she can in the water. And her laughter...I still think it's one of the best things I have ever and will ever hear. Right up there with hearing her sweet voice first thing in the morning reminding me I am loved. It's been far too long since the depth of my love for her has moved me to tears...and here I sit reminding myself that she is the reason I need to be whole and happy.   Take that extra minute to find the beauty in your day, that one small reason no matter what it might be...remind yourself it doesn't all have to be stress and hurry. Cause this ride around the sun will be as brief as the ones before and the cosmos needs your spark of light to be full of everything that made you smile.  Cheers
what the hell is that? dammit I just had a flu I don't want another, I have to go back to work on Monday IIIICCCCKKKKKYYY!!!!  I went there today to see what was up and found out they moved my desk, or at least they will on Monday...so I will get to unpack all my stuff and set my junk up again lol. I should take more pins and tacks cause I am sure all mine got stolen.  The more things change the more things stay the same only not, only do, only not...only um yeah something...and know what else? WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   urlLink http://www.amishdonkey.com/weeee.php   don't click that link if you are offended by the word gonads...ahahahaaaaa   CHEERS!!!!!

I pay what the government says I have to pay.... I can't helop their laws HIM (4:41:25 PM): you are the one who wants it...but does not pay for it ME (4:41:39 PM): if everyone had jobs like yours, your trash wouldn't get picked up every week..... your stores wouldn't have anything in them because there would be no truck drivers to haul it there would be no waitress to take your order then next time you eat in a restaurant HIM have news for you....trash haulers make 40k a year and belong to unions ME (4:42:45 PM): my ex husband is a trash hauler for the city.... he makes $10 an hour, with no union HIM(4:43:09 PM): that is because he choose to live in a little town and haul trash ME (4:43:27 PM): you can live the life you choose, but no one else can ME (4:43:28 PM): interestinG ME (4:43:56 PM): and if there were no farmers, which my whole family is, what would be on your dinner table tonight? HIM (4:44:26 PM): I believe it is my duty as an american to PAY MY FAIR SHARE....I don't care what the govt says...then I also donate money to charities.....my father owns a cattle ranch in Protection Ks ME (4:44:40 PM): people in little towns need their trash hauled too, you know HIM (4:44:46 PM): almost lost his whole biz 2 years ago because of the poor beef market ME (4:45:01 PM): well... thats because he chooses to be a rancher ME (4:45:11 PM): if he lived in a city and had a desk job that wouldn't happen to him ME (4:45:16 PM): your logic, not mine HIM (4:45:17 PM): true....and there will always be someone willing to take that job and not pay thier fair share HIM (4:45:39 PM): I can haul my own trash ME (4:45:46 PM): we pay what we are told to pay.... go be a politician and change the laws if you don't like it ME (4:46:59 PM): and you are going to grow a garden and raise cattle in your back yard, right?? HIM (4:47:00 PM): that is the problem....exactly what our founding fathers warned us about....50% of the population pays little or no fed taxes..........and they vote in congressman that pander to them...so the people who have good jobs keep having to pay more and more and more ME (4:47:17 PM): so run for office and change it!

(this is not a personal attack this is just a hypothetical question for the sake of the debate) HIM (4:54:42 PM): if we are all supposed to be equal...why is my tax rate twice of yours ME (4:54:56 PM): I don't know... and I don't think its fair either ME (4:55:05 PM): its the government HIM (4:55:06 PM): in our govt...I am actually punished for being more productive ME (4:55:10 PM): not the little people ME (4:55:18 PM): yes, you are ME (4:55:38 PM): you are not making a good point here for me wanting to be more productive~~~ and it went on... Id like to hear other opinions on this...
My dad died tonight. 7:03 pm. He wasn't my birth dad, but he adopted me when he married my mom, I was 1 1/2. They divorced when I was about 14 or so, but he was always a part of my life. He had cancer. I hadn't seen him in a year. We weren't getting along... every time I went there, he found a way to insult me, I always left there feeling bad... so I stopped going. My step mom had called, today, said he was real bad. My sister and I were going up tomorrow to see him...  I wanted to put things right between us...  I wanted to tell him that I still loved him... My friends say that of course he knew that... but I don't know that... I didn't get to look into his eyes and tell him that...  Please, if anyone ever reads this, no matter what time of day or night it is, if your parents are still living, call them NOW and tell them you love them... before its too late.
Have you ever read 'The picture of Dorian Gray' by Oscar Wilde? It is an interesting book... here is an interesting bit I just came across, reading today... (I'm rereading the book, haven't read it in years)  ~~'Only when one is young,' she answered. 'When an old woman like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me how to become young again.' He thought for a moment. 'Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?' he asked, looking at her across the table. 'A great many, I fear,' she cried. 'Then commit them over again,' he said gravely. 'To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.' 'A delightful theory!' she exclaimed. 'I must put it into practice.' 'A dangerous theory!' came from Sir Thomas's tight lips. Lady Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened. 'Yes,' he continued, 'that is one of the great secrets of life. Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.' A laugh ran round the table.~~  The only thing one regrets is one's mistakes... Interesting theory. I'm not sure that I agree with that... Maybe, to some degree... But the OTHER theory... To get back one's youth one had merely to repeat one's follies... That is very true... So many people tell me that I look and act so much younger than I am, but the acting young is what promotes the looking young... Other people my age think that now that they are a 'certain age' they have to act a 'certain way'... That is what makes people old... old is an attitude, not an age... I can think of lots of 'follies' from my youth I would love to repeat... and do so on every available occasion....lol
Lacuna Coil. I suppose I am the last person to hear this group, but I just did so recently. They blew me away. My tastes in music vary widely. Classic rock, alternative rock, techno, country, jazz, R&B, hip-hop, new age, classical... just about anything but polka...(appologies to the polka fans out there.) This is my current 'obsession'. Living out in the boonies in southwestern Kansas has its advantages, but available radio stataions and nearby music stores are not among them. So, I listen to Lacuna Coil online, until I can get somewhere that actually sells their music.  Check out their website at:   urlLink http://www.lacunacoil.it/etc/html/eng/index.htm
Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative. 'Oscar Wilde'
'Scars heal glory fades and all we're left with are the memories made pain hurts  but only for a minute life is short  so go on and live it.' Chris Cagle
' Life isn't a journey to the grave with the intentions of arriving safely in a pretty & well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, & loudly proclaiming DAMN what a Ride!'
One of the best Gothic poetry sites on the web, in my opinion, is this one:  urlLink http://www.ravensrants.com/index.html   Raven's poetry is brilliant, breaking the gothic poetry stereotype...everyone thinks gothic poetry = poems about death.  Crystal Night  I walked out one crystal night and the air was cold and black every star held bright and true against it's midnight back The moon hung low above the trees as silent as a ghost and I sat there in the fields as frigid as a post This night was so gorgeous just like a movie scene and even the trees kept still to keep my view pristine My mind began to wonder through thoughts about this place It wished to share with someone nature's purest face But around me there was not a soul not a heart to make a sound and I knew I was all alone when I began to look around Then my heart felt empty like the space between the stars I knew the night alone couldn't heal all my scars So with that I began to walking back into the night i knew that I would need someone to help me win this fight So now I must leave this scene until some other time Because until I can share it it's just a song without a rhyme ~RAVEN~ If poetry interests you at all, you must check this site out... even if you are not goth, open your mind and experience something new...
First, you should read my profile. Having done that, we can proceed... This is mainly a place to collect all my favorite quotes, poetry, some of mine included, and websites I like... I am a large mix of many personalities and talents... this could be an interesting trip...
Ok. Maybe that last entry was typed with rose colored glasses on... he is a very great guy, but I never get to see him that much. haven't seen him in two weeks, or talked to him in over 1 week... I really think we could be perfect, except I need somone I can do things with... My sister (the 'golden child') has a great man. She always has great guys...and always gets her way, and has a perfect house...blah, blah, blah.... not to mention she is 6'1', about 130 wringing wet, is very pretty and very classically feminine... she has it all, always has....ANYWAY... She and her boyfriend are constantly together, doing things with his kids, and working on his farm together... he is very respected, he is the undersheriff of our county. I seem to have a sign on my forehead that says 'Losers Welcome', because that is the only group of men who ever ask me out... *sigh* Not that Steven is a loser, by all means, but he is so busy in his life, and set in his ways, he doesn't think about taking me with him to go do things, and I live 45 miles away, and most of the time he would have to pick me up because my ex-husband has my car...(long story) Anyway... life just kinda sucks, but seems I'd better get used to it, eh?
It never ceases to amaze me how wonderful it is to go to Steven's farm ... out in the middle of nowhere, with a half mile long driveway... it is quiet, secluded... beautiful... not to mention that Steve is the most wonderful man on the planet... I am so glad we decided to stick it out and stay together, looks like we are going to be together for a long while... He told me, 'I have finally decided to admit it...after three years, I admit that I love you, and I want more of you in my life.' then he asked me what I thought about that... I said 'It's about damn time...'  LOL... Patience Perserveres... the good girl wins out in the end...lol Life couldn't get much better than this...lol
I have the night off... And I'm spending the day and probably the night at Steven's... I am so psyched... I hope that my patience has paid off.. He has come to a point in his life where he wants to settle down with one woman he can trust... And, he says, the only one he can trust is me... That he has always known that I was the one... Said I scared him a bit, because I understood him way more than any other woman ever has... He isn't the sort to get close to anyone, really.. But we are close, and that has bothered him in the past, but he has accepted it now... He knows I love him no matter what... We will see how it goes... I have thought this was happening in the past, only to go months without hearing from him... But maybe this is the time... I'm holding back judgment, though, I have been hurt too much before... We shall see... There are a couple of guys who have been sort of trying to get me to see them, but they are both attached... Both of them not traditionally married, but have live-in girlfriends... And I just won't go there... I talked to both of them last night, and they both made slightly jealous little comments...LOL... I am just not that sort of girl... Plus, Steven has always been the 'high standard' in my heart... No one lives up to him....
Old school punk!  You just say what you have to say regardless of what everyone else thinks! You're one of my most favourite types of music...  You're raw and uncut!  You're surrounded by hype...just don't let it make you go insane...    urlLink   What genre of rock are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
I have had an on-again off-again relationship with Steven for the last three years. He goes months without calling me, but every time he calls, I go back to him... It's hard to explain, but he is exactly what I want... And if living this way is the cost of being able to be with him occasionally, I suppose its worth it... He is EXTREMELY intelligent, 6'4', 240,piercing blue eyes, very intense, disciplined, confident...But he is also very kind, and caring... He makes me feel completely safe when I am with him... And even in the months in-between, I know that if anything happens to me, I can call on him and he will be there... If anyone ever hurt me, I know he would 'take care of it'... He is a little scary, maybe, knowing what I know about the world he lives in, and some of the people he knows... But he is so strong, I have always felt like he was my 'protector'...  Anyway, he has contacted me again... It is so wonderful seeing his messages, knowing he is still thinking about me, even if his life gets too complicated to call or email me at times... Maybe I will go to be with him soon, that would be wonderful...Someday, I hope to be with him all the time... But until then, I will take what I can get...
Arwen   If I were a character in   The Lord of the Rings  , I would be Arwen, Elf, the daughter of Elrond.  In the movie, I am played by  Liv Tyler .  Who would  you  be?   Zovakware Lord of the Rings Test      with  Perseus Web Survey Software         I would have rather been Eowyn... I think I have more in common with her... we both would rather ride into battle with the men than stay behind...we both end up  falling in love with a man already taken... she and I have lots more in common I think than Arwen and I... (Although having a man like Aragorn in love with me is worth this test saying I am Arwen...lol) I do have a man I am in love with... he is sort of like Aragorn, although he has a dark side that Aragorn doesn't have... maybe he's more like Boromir...who, by the way, is the one in that movie that really drove me crazy...lol
Last night, my night off, I ended up working from midnight to 4:30 am because my best friend at work pulled a no-show, no-call... he showed up at 4, seems he and his girlfriend were fighting all day and he took off too mad to think about coming to work... hmmm... he'd better grow out of that, maybe take some anger management classes, and maybe get rid of the girlfriend if she's gonna be that much trouble...just because two people have a child together doesn't mean they were meant to be together forever... Anyway, I didn't have any sleep before I went in, and I was dead by the time I got home... got woke up by severe thunderstorms this  morning... hail as big as shooter marbles...now its just wet and gloomy... Will be going to sleep later, have to go in to work at midnight, (my own shift this time!) This gloomy day will make for good sleeping... Found some interesting movie trailers last night... look like pretty good movies... One of them is from M. Night Shyamalan, who has done some really great movies like 'The Others', 'Signs', and 'Sixth Sense'... its called 'The Village'... can't wait to see that one... urlLink http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2483648   the other is 'Ju On: the Grudge', a Japanese horror film... it looks awesome too...  urlLink http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2639981  Can you tell I like horror movies?  lol... that  urlLink http://www.ifilm.com/ is a great website... another one I really like is:  urlLink http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/  I can't wait for my daughter to get here to watch her brother... its extremely dark in my bedroom, and its nice and cool,(maybe I lived in a cave in a former life????) and the thunder is still rumbling, and the rain falling lightly... what a great afternoon to sleep....
This place is wearing on me like it did growing up here.  Everyone in this town works their ass off trying to be just like every one else.  Someone needs to tell them that the world does not end at the county line. We are citizens of the world, not just of Hick County.  Around here, music means classic rock or country. Period. (Nothing wrong with either... I listen to those too...) I listen to Gothic, punk,&nbsp;alternative, jazz, R&amp;B, soul, classical, techno, industrial, you name it... Anything but polka...LOL I have friends around the world, (online) and from all religions and races. If most of the people here knew I had friends that were Pagan, or wiccan, or heaven forbid Agnostic, I would probably be burned at the stake.  I get so tired of know-it-all people who never think outside the box... I love art, and poetry, and good literature... I crave intelligent conversation, on literature, philosophy, religion... I want to be able to buy really good clothes without driving 250 miles... (I HATE Wal-Mart!) I long for coffee shops, with real cappuchino, not the powdered kind that sputters out of a machine like bad hot cocoa... A book store with a good selection, a music store that actually has the music I want (Cooper Temple Clause is an unheard of group in this God-forsaken place!!) I want to get my nose pierced without losing my job. (Yes, I was told I can't work where I work with my nose pierced!)  My house is probably the only one for miles that is decorated in modern furniture and artwork... (95% of all homes here are done in 'cutsey' country... )  All women are expected to be sweet little things, quiet, 'respectful'... that isn't me either! I am tough, intelligent, and that scares most rednecks...  What am I still doing here??  I wanted my son to go to a small school. Not one with rampant drugs, and teen pregnancies, and security guards...  I suppose this is a small price to pay for my son, but I will be 49 years old when he is 18... Will I be too old to start my *real* life then????
Why can't I just learn to say no!? Last night at work, a guy came in I hadn't seen in a while. We... Well, for lack of a better term, were 'fuck buddies' when I was in high school. He was with another woman, but while she was busy at the counter, he came back and talked to me...Flirting, hinting at things that we had done 'back then', and asked for my phone number and email... And I gave it to him!  I know for a fact that he is not interested in what I am looking for... I want a real relationship, I want someone that respects me, cares about me. He just wants someone to 'play' with... I KNOW THAT, so WHY did I not just say no??!?  When I married my husband, I loved him. But I also had, in the back of my mind, the thought that no one else would ever ask me to marry him, so I'd better say yes. That recording seems to be still playing in my head, as if I should feel grateful to any man who shows the least bit of attention to me. I know that is what I am doing, yet when the man is standing there I don't think about it... I don't say no... I simply grab onto the attention like a woman overboard grabbing a flotation device.&nbsp; I get so mad at myself sometimes... I seem to be scared to say no...  &nbsp; I have been doing the same thing with another man, Stuart. All he is looking for is a good time... But I tell him, oh yeah, I'll call.... Instead of just telling him that we want different things, and a 'roll in the hay' is not what I want...  Someday, somehow, this has got to change... But IM not sure how to get there...
I have a habit of constantly heading down dead-end roads, that I KNOW are dead ends. Not real roads, but life's roads... I usually ONLY am attracted to older men. I have never really been attracted to younger men. BUT... I have a friend that is 10 years younger than me that I am VERY attracted to. Not a bad thing in and of itself, BUT he has a girlfriend. A pretty permanent one.  Why do I always fall for the ones I can't have? Girlfriends, wives... Every man I find myself being attracted to is already attached... Isn't there some psychological reasoning behind that??  Maybe it's just that what they say is true... All the good ones are taken... I don't know, but it drives me crazy... And HE drives me crazy... And it doesn't help that he is an incessant flirt, that just makes me feel worse... **NOTE TO GUYS: If you are otherwise attached, please don't be a tease! If you are not happy in your relationship, get out of it, THEN you can flirt... It's not fair otherwise...
Even though I am exhausted after today, I must get in my rant to get a good night's sleep. My sister freakin disgusts me. I'm completely serious. Those who've kept up to date with my family drama knows what she's like, but it's like she gets more disrespectful towards my parents, me, whomever, every day. And the fact that my folks continually put up with her sh** astounds me. KICK HER OUT OF THE GOD DAMN HOUSE!! I'm sorry, she no longer has gas money to get to/from work until her next payday because she's giving it to her deadbeat, no job, I-scam-my-own-kid-because-I'm-too-lazy-to-work boyfriend. Make her walk to work Dad, take the bus, whatever. MAKE HER GROW UP!! Stop bailing her out, literally, figuratively, you name it. Just stop. Stop cosigning her bankruptcy papers, stop interrupting your day to bring her lunch, stop letting her order beer with dinner after two DUI's, stop allowing her jackass boyfriend over without backing your threats to call the cops on him. STOP ENABLING HER! I'm beyond angry at her now-- there's no point anymore. She is and will probably always be a me-me-me person, and the way she treats my parents, she can frankly go to hell at this point. But the fact that my parents keep taking it over and over, saying that they're finally going to draw the line and enforce rules but then get lazy about following up with it, I'm about ready to distance myself from all of them. If your own lives, household, health, or sanity isn't worth fighting for, nothing I can try to say anymore is going to change your minds. You pretend to listen, but apparently I'm the only one who feels your existence is worth it. Kick her out, for the love of god, and let her finally live with the consequences of her dumbass decisions. She's freakin 24; she'll learn to deal.  My God! Are there any non-dysfunctional families out there anymore, seriously???  Okay, I'm done now. Really can't wait for the holidays now....
Today Travis and I went out to run a few errands and have a nibble afterwards. In an attempt to do so, however, we discovered the true meaning of hell on earth as we know it. This hell is otherwise known as U Village. You may be familiar with it, what with its trendy, overpriced department stores and coffee shops, orange-fleshed patrons pushing the pedals of their graduation-gift Lexuses with their pristine Ugg boots. Hell. We honestly could not understand what about this place made seemingly normal people such twits. Parents suddenly flinging their toddlers into the street because they, after all,  do  have the right of way. Stay at home moms in trendy Touregs blocking entire lanes in the parking lot so that they could selfishly have that next available spot, no matter how long the line behind her was. HELL!    It all connects to a bigger picture to me, the things that rank high on my pet peeve list. It's why I hate leaving home on weekends. The chaos, the carelessness, the selfish people who think it's all about them in this world. It's making me already dread the approaching holiday season, for the love of God! I hope people don't mind more internet shopping this year; I fear that with my lowering tolerance and increasing road rage that my braking foot might fail at a very inopportune time for you, dear affluent family with your triple-seated stroller walking down the very center of the road without any regard of my approaching bumper right on your Tevas. Come now, would it really be such a shame to have one less of you out there? I thought not.
Because I fear The Wraith and Hoggle equally as much, it will probably be a while before a young fellow called Kristensen will hear about my joining the blogging world. For those who do learn of my existence here, expect nothing earth-shattering or mind-blowing. You should know by now that I am a quiet one, not as politically savvy as the men-folk in my life, opinionated still but just choose to keep it to myself more often than not. So here goes, some inner thoughts.  I just read some of Foutsy's previous postings, and I have to say it, he's an outright liar.  When referring to the 4th's fireworks display, he states that he's 'just not as impressed with big flashy things.'  And yet not a single other person could outjump him or squeal louder than his shrill soprano voice could at Tim's bachelor party.  All of the other men had fallen silent at the sight of the groom-to-be's scrotal bling, but not the Fouts.  It was blinding and it was magnificent.  I like boobs. Most of you do too, admit it. They're one of the only true bonuses of gaining a few extra pounds, and I love it. They're squishy, they bounce just so, they help fill out an outfit just a bit more, they draw (sometimes flattering, other times creepy) stares, they're fun.  Picture two octopi rubberbanded together, and poke.   Neato.  Last night the kids and I went to a local eating establishment and met Tim's new coworker, Gina.  Sweet girl, funny, outgoing, cute for a borderline midget.  I, however, hope that we can use young Gina to get to her acquaintance with a most unfortunate name.  Run and hide,  Tora   Teenus , for you shall have no peace once you are found.
'PAinkiller'  The past is like a gaping hole No matter how hard you try to run from it You just find that you are running in circles You think of the cause and effect Every action you have made The scar, which the past had inflicted, cannot be healed Like a wounded bird trapped in a cage You realize that the same mistakes being made Your conscience hunted you  You start to doubt yourself Asking yourself the same questions over and over again You felt weak No longer the will to walk on Prayers to god was a momentarily salvation But never was it a cure Painkillers ease but not your pain As you see your love ones One by one Vanishing into the darkness  When you tried to grasp and treasure them  They were all gone Your eyes were hollow, empty without life When you tried to love another  Mistakes were repeated Sorrows and misery embedded Deepened and worsened
It is the birth of one  And the evolution of another Slave to its master Yet a master to change  Bending rules Forgoing the ancient laws   Words carved beautiful statues Bringing them to life  Beating heart beats and explosion of emotions Sorrows, love, pain and joy  All intertwined  Birth of life and the dawn of death All raised from its graves Only one who weaves its thread  Wield its might Like a tamed lion Becoming a friend to its lord
A cup filled with the rainbow of colours Each signify a different meaning Some surfaced to simplicity others hid deep meanings Colours varied in different forms When blue might appear blue Often it does not  I was a boy  A simple boy My appearance, my shell My face, my mask My heart is so disguise  I fear so much to reveal my true self Will others shy from me? Will the people who care for me leave? Will I be alone? So many questions,so many answers I need to know  Fatigue washed over me like a tidal wave Maintaining the cloak sapped my strength The weight of the world weigh down upon me Nothing seems to aid Still I have to carry on Battling against an unseen enemy
Time past like a dragging cart I studied the sea of sweaty faces Some delighted in mirth Others solemn and distant While I struggled with my apparent task The weight of the rifle seems to drag me down Blood flowed from cuts Pain and fatigue weakened my determined mind I lick the dry skin of my lips My feet turn from flesh to lead My mind and eyes wandered  As sun faded out of view The day ended The weight of responsibilities and rules lifted from my shoulders A young primary student walk past me Reminding me how fortunate they were  But still they have to face the inevitable weight of responsibilities  And the winding paths of failures
âWe must not fail our duty, let us ride on!â Lysandros barked a command as he spurred his steed onwards. He muttered a silent blessing to Khaine as the fog begun to shroud the land. He and the few other scouts have lost their way among the fog, if he does not bring this message to Aldamir, the rest of the army would be in peril. Adamantios pointed ahead as a tide of darkness swarmed over the path ahead. Lysandros nodded as they rode into the trees, which provide ample cover for them. There was an order to keep silent and any communication was to be passed by hand signals. The chitterling horde marched forward, ranks and ranks of units were tightly packed together.   âI hate this damn whether!â Quikchitter bared his teeth. Quikwarp who stood proudly.   beside him nearly squirted the musk of fear as he tried to push it back.   He was honored to be invited by the Grey seer to ride upon the Cauldron of thousand poxes. As the cauldron went it releases terrifying screams and laughter, which would even send chill down the spin of a dragon. Quikchitter pondered about where will be their next destination, the arrogant Quikwarp was almost too proud he should have let him walked with the rest of the army. â Quikwarp I have an important task for you.â   âWhat is your wish? Most potent of potentates,â He replied boldly as he swings his tail around excitedly.   âI need you to go down and check to see if the ratling guns are working well, recently there seems to be some minor malfunction,â Quikchitter spoke rapidly spurting saliva into the cauldron of thousand poxes. Only to be responded by hideous hissing sound.  His ears lowered and lost his enthusiasm as he heard the bad news. He muttered silent cures to the Grey seer and half hopingly that he hadnât heard it. He made his way down the filthy corpses as he pinched his nose, he wondered how could the Grey seer have stand to all these perhaps he have a spell which could remove this repugnant smell. It was all too possible; the selfish Grey seer would not impart his arcane arts to anyone. As he walked towards his own company of clan Skyre rats, he thought he had smelled something. Among the smell of furs and rats, he smelled something unusual as he tried sniffing harder. âElves!â  He curse the day that he had been born, the foul rats have spotted them. If they were to ride out from here they would be swarmed by hundreds of rats. There would be no chances of survival. If they were to abandon their horses here they would not make it in time to deliver the message. But sacrifices were needed to be made. He signaled one of men and whispered into his ears. His face betrayed incomprehension but swiftly nodded and proceeds to task.   The Grey seer stood upon the surveying his army as pride swelled within him. He attempts a grasp at the winds of magic. Gathering a small globe of energy in his hands, he blasted a slave pulling the cauldron. The rat expanded and contracted his eyes were red and was swelling to a point of bursting. Poxes and symptoms of diseases appeared on his skin. And soon the rat exploded leaving only a pile of bones producing putrid smells. âFaster, faster, quick, quick!â The Grey seer snarled as he lashed out with his whip. Suddenly, bells were rung and he knew they were being attack. Anger and rage boil within him as he wondered who dared an intrusion into his army. The frenzied monks broke of the ranks and gave chased towards their enemy. Shouting war cries and froth and phlegmâs dripped from their mouth. Quikchitter quickly cast a spell of vision, and so he could see clearly what was disturbing their flanks. The vision shifted in and out, blurring images and palpable ones. The spell stabled as he could see a horse running away from his army. âStupid fools, its only a horse,â he spoke softly under his breath. A green light glowed madly on his fingers, sending the shadows dancing like a mad caper on the ground. He incanted the ancient words of his ancestors and unleashed a streak of green lighting towards the escaping horse. Reducing it into a pile of dust. The blood frenzied monks gave up as they saw there was nothing to kill and hurried back to bolster the ranks of the army.       A boyish smile appeared on his face as he savors the victory. â Well done men.â Lysandros spoke softly but just enough for the elves to hear.
The young elf ducked as a blade shimmered past, at the same time lashing out and hamstringing his brutish foe. The orc gave a deafening roar and fell to the ground like a huge tree shaking the ground. The thin elf stepped aside nimbly, avoiding the collapsing bulk. Drawing his dagger, he bent down and delivered the killing blow.  The champion looked up from the dead body and saw that his comrades werenât doing so well. Many of them had fallen before the orcish onslaught. He knew any moment from now would mean life and death. He raced with elegant steps across the slaughter ground avoiding the corpses on the ground.   âTo me!â Mansuetus commanded as he raises his sword high so everyone could see. Within minutes the elves formed a circle around him raising their spears high threatening anyone who comes within a metre length. He surveyed his disciplined soldiers proudly. The well-trained elves did not fail him. A few orcs made a daring attempt trying to carve its way through but only ended but with spears through his torso. â Hold! Elves and you would live. Expect no quarters, for you would give them none!â The leader bellowed and every elf shouted in a single tone.â Hundred of orcs surrounded them waiting for a hole the defenses. A few orcs again made daring attempts but soon ended up dead. It seems the orcs werenât as patient, Mansuetus thought as a smirk appeared on his face. â On my command, you would send this brutes to wherever they came from!â He shouted a command in the ancient language to the crossbowmen. The crossbowmen loaded their crossbow and nodded in understanding.  Finally the orcs patient was at an end, the green skins roared and shouted war cries in their primitive language. âNow!â the champion signaled and spears was leveled to the eye and sound of crossbows unleashing death. This was what he savored every moment as the orcs lumbered into the wall of spikes. Steel met steel, blood splattered everywhere and sound of screams and shouts filled the air. â Fight on my elves and fight well for this day you will replenish the blood within your armors!â Mansuetus charged in fray of combat, slashing and hacking as he went. An orc twice the shoulder length of him and was the largest orc he had ever seen. The massive orc bawled a challenge, and was quickly answered.   Through the visor he stare into the eye of his foe trying to anticipate his every move. The orc wield his axe menacingly and gave an evil laughter. âFleâ be fo  ma, da wilâ na de fet ma.â His voice boomed loudly as he made his unstoppable assault. Mansuetus parried with every ounce of strength and speed he could muster. Strands of hair flew as he avoided the humongous axe only by an inche. He saw an opening and made a riposte attack only to see his blade bouncing harmlessly off the orc tough hide. What would appear a grin appeared on the orc ugly face. Beads of perspiration dripped down his delicate face. He was panting heavily and he felt he could not hold off the assault anymore. His bones ache like a rusty mechanism. His green skin foe seems to be tireless only to be laughing and fighting. Fear gripped him like a vice.  Darkness descended. His eyes were wide opened, he groaned in pain. Blood streamed down from his open wound. Every strands of strength was sapped away from him, he could no longer feel his legs, and his limbs were drained. He dropped his axe and crashed into the ground. Mansuetus took moments to realize that a shadowy figure was at the standing at the back of the orc general. He wanted to laugh at the moment but could not. From the shadows came a calmed voice, âThou have done well Mansuetus, champion of fifth regiment of the Shadow Warriors.â Only to realized he was the assassin, whom his general had spoken well of Mansuetues made a courtly bow and said, â I thank thee for thine compliment for if thou wouldst have saved me, and I wouldst have fallen to these cursed orcs.â  âThe battle is over, assemble the elves and have them report back to the camp immediately,â he spoke softly.  Mansuetus nodded and said, âYes, my lord.â        Mansuetus walked into his simple house, he took off his armour and took his scabbard and hang it by the side. âMansuetus! You are finally home I was so worried about you.â Mliara said excitedly as tears swelled in her eyes. She was a beautiful woman, with striking features and fine figure. She ran over to embrace him, and kissed him deeply. Fatigue of the battle and heat of love conflict, and he spoke softly, âI missed you greatly, but I am tired now I wish to rest.â He gave a reassuring smile and wiped the tears softly away from her face. âI have prepared your clothing and when you have finish bathing, we can have a good feast tonight.â He took up his fresh clothing and walked over to the river.   He could see the clear water flowing gushing down the endless river. The wind blew softly and the leaves rustled. He stripped off his bloodstained tunic and entered the refreshing water. He rested on the rocks by the riverbank and enjoys the peaceful and soothing ambience. Life was too perfect for a moment he had a caring and lovely wife and recently he was promoted to captain of his regiment. The extra income would provide a better life for his wife and he himself. He opened his eyes lazily not knowing for how long he had slept. Suddenly sound of splashing water made him jumped to his feet. He quickly put on the robes his wife had sewn for him and with drew the dagger in his boots. He sneaked among the bushes, his natural talents made him moving like a cat, among the bushes. He crouched down and to his horror he saw bands of men dressed in barbaric helms and leather clothing wading through the river.   He quickly made his way back to his house and put on his battle equipment. He and his wife quickly made their way out of the house. Every second lost would mean life and death. They ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Suddenly shouts could be heard. Mansuetus heart raced, as he knew the enemy had spotted them. Mliara tripped on a piece of rock and fell, blood was spotted on her knees. âMliara!â shouted the battle-trained warrior.   âI can..notâ¦..go on any fur..ther, Mansuetus you mustâ¦carry on!â she slurred as tears burst forth from her.   âMy love I cannot go on without you, if we must die we must die together.â He ran back and carries her on the back. âYou cannot run fast enough if you would carry me, they would soon catch up with us.â Perspiration streamed down his face, muscles tensed as he ran with all his might. Sound of his pursuers came closer and closer; he knew with every step they make they would be one more step towards the city. The chaos men were coming closer and closer. He fought on against the endless tide. What would have seemed forever, he thought ended with a loud thud sound. Droplets of blood glittering in the sun spurted forth. Grief and sorrow overwhelmed him. He stopped and slowly put her down by the side of a tree. An arrow protruded through her chest. âIâm sorry my loved one,â she said drawing all the energy within her. Her eyes closed and he knew she was dead. He gripped his sword and there was a glint of madness in his eyes. Blood course through his veins. He invoked the name of Khaine and turned around to face the chaos worshippers. A muscular man held a bow in his hand and smiled, happy that he had shot the target but soon his smile was gone as he head rolled off to the ground.   Mansuetus, captain of fifth regiment of the Shadow Warriors fought with frenzy and hatred. He was cutting left and right beheading anyone who come within the tip of his blade. The chaos worshippers soon learn to fear him, they surrounded him and no one dared to attempt an attack. He glared menacingly at his foes, if it was as if just a look of his eyes to even cause fear in the heart of a stout dwarf. He swings his blade in a sinister way. Light danced off from his blood-forged armour, the runes on his sleeves glowed brightly. Instead of waiting he lunged forward skewering the groin and hamstringing another. More chaos men formed up around him. Only rage and sorrow were gushing through him. In his eyes he knew no fear. Regardless of his own life he charged into the tide. Hacking and slashing and hewed a path though the chaos men. But slowly he was overwhelmed no matter how fast he could dodge or strike he was unable to. The chaos men swarmed down on him and held him tightly. He roared in rage and bit his teeth into his tongue the sweet taste of blood filled his mouth. Veins were bulging up as he struggled frantically.   A group of elves charged into the fray and it was all too much for the chaos worshippers. They turned and fled ignoring leaving their weapons on the ground. Mansuetus lay on the ground filled with cuts and bruises. A huge scar was evidently marked on his armour only missing his flesh only by a few inche. His eyes were vacant; he felt life has no meaning with the death of his wife. âWe spotted this band after a few peasants had sounded the alarm. We apologies for the late arrival.â The leaderâs words contained sympathy and fear. He ordered two of his men to aid him to stand. Their faced betrayed irritation as they tried to push it back. Mansuetus staggered across to his wife and knelt beside her. Tears swelled in his eyes, as he buried his head in his wife hair. â Please wake up my love, I beg of you.â
Friends are like ships Anchored their lines by the harbor Each secrete their own goods Revealing only the hull Whether they bring wealth or disasters Cannot be foretold Some anchored for long others drift into the vast empty seas Some grow stale and become constant companions
I looked upon the world A pulsing light  Growing every minute Daring and brave was I  I challenge its unknown might Blood was spilled Tainted the lands A new champion arises  Such was its might I was imprisoned Chained to the bounds of eternity Strength and life was drained from me The brightness in my eye flickered and faded  Sorrows and agony clenched my heart  Fatigue was my constant companion Memories and nightmares haunted me The aura of it presence tremble me every moment Flesh rot and hang from my whitish limbs The seductive allure of hell draws me towards it  Writing the last sentence of my life I watched my life flashed before me Like a rat was I  Staring at the unassailable titan  Witnessing my blade turning to dust My armor my faith swept away with the currents My shield my honor is what I have left  Crows and vultures flew the skies covering the sun to an eclipse  Jokers and minstrels both sang and mock at my foolishness  Perusing his poems And studying mine Looking down at my own demise Drowned my heart and soul
urlLink    'Church'  Bells rang of my failures Rows of empty seats marked my mind Sorrows came instead of prayers Vanishing briliance of gems, faded my eyes Tapestries hung torn and tattered,worn my facade Tainted walls, wounded my soul Flames flickerd against the winds And darkness flown with the chill
'Splinters Love' Dawn of the sun Is the end of night The end of summer Is the onlslaught of winter  So many times When you love someone Even loving was painful When the love was broken So much does the splinters of love hurt the heart  The birth of love Is the dawn of joy And the end of love  Is the renewal of pain
'The puppet'  His eyes sparkled A smile brightened his face He danced in the lucid night Twirling and spinning He sang songs equal of a bard Graceful was his movements and his soul and body became one Kings and queens were dazzled by his arts Servants and slaves paused in awe  Time drags on  And kings yawned Time and his mind became mine Strings attached, Snapped and torned His purpose was fulfilled  And so he was to end A smile faded his off his face
'The deer'  Eyes darted Ears perked  Shuffling sound of dead leaves, Fingers of the frigid wind caressed the innocent soul  Muscles and sinews tensed Watchful eyes watched its prey And wolves howl in triumphant Dark clouds shrouded the moon Shadows danced back and forth Signalling the end
There have been times in my life when I have felt helpless.It is perhaps the most acute pain a person can know, founded in frustration andand ventless rage.The nick of sword upon a battling soldier's arm cannot compare to the anguish a prisoner feels at the crack of a whip. Even if the whip does no strike the helpless prisoner's body, it surely cuts deeply at his soul.  We all are prisoners at one time or another in our lives, prisoners to ourselves or to the expectations of those around us. It is a burden that all people endure, that all people despise, and that few people ever learn to escape. I perhaps are one of them who cannot escape the bound of reality. Sometimes living for others seems like the only choice, we in life are chained by society and law. Do we have to follow?
'Five for fighting' Song  I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive I'm just out to find The better part of me  I'm more than a bird I'm more than a plane I'm more than some pretty face beside a train And it's not easy to be me  I wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie 'Bout a home I'll never see  It may sound absurd But don't be naive Even heroes have the right to bleed I may be disturbed But won't you concede Even heroes have the right to dream And it's not easy to be me  Up, up and away, away from me Well it's alright You can all sleep sound tonight I'm not crazy or anything  I can't stand to fly I'm not that naive Men weren't meant to ride With clouds between their knees  I'm only a man in a silly red sheet Digging for kryptonite on this one way street I'm only a man in a funny red sheet Looking for special things inside of me, inside of me Inside of me, yeah inside of me, inside of me  I'm only a man in a funny red sheet I'm only a man looking for a dream I'm only a man in a funny red sheet And it's not easyâ¦ It's not easy to be me
'The hierachical order'  Blades tore skies apart Lightning splits the wounded bird Silent winds swept the lands asunder Angry clouds darkened the skies Scythe of reapers plough the cities  Lucid dreams haunted in forms of echoing shadows Treachery spoke louder than compassion Every corner was a silent dagger, And a coup practiced neater than a courteous bow Even masters contorted in fear While slaves waited for the darkness to descend Shadows rise and fall unendingly
Unsurprisingly, it is the 14 of june. I have been spending my time most often in Npcc, but many things have past that worthed my attention and pondering.   The Angel Well over my days i must say, i have valued and tried to learn as much as possible. I read the book, Woman can't read maps and men just can't listen. Haha, strange choice ehh? It made me understand the difference between men and woman and why such difference exist, and what we can do to prevent pressing the red button. Now i move on to a new book written by a famous and good writer, R.A Salvatore who wrote many good series. I have only managed to the first book among the hundreds.    Other than that, it has been most satisfying to win another battle against the odds. Perhaps i have played too long and the expierance have been instilled upon me or perhaps my opponent needed more time.  Another attributes which i have gained over the days was being able to control myself over problems and everything. Being composed in difficult or tough situations is a most useful skill. I have to thank warhammer for that...haha  The devil  There are always evil thoughts which sprouted in my youthful mind. Sometimes it pays to heed its call but i must not be misled. Now i realise more that firends are the essential ladder steps to climb to the top. But perhaps it is nothng more than a evil thought. Still it makes sense, other than simple ladder steps friends provide companionship and someone to talk to. Now i must try to get rid of it.Begone creature of hell!  The dark  Since from last week, my good cousin or rather my best friend had left for army. I miss his companionship and a listener for my sorrows and joys, and nevertheless some good laughters.Still i cant change anything it is beyong my capability to prevent it. Though I was glad that he was positive about it instead of frowning.   Npcc has took up most of my time, spending my time sitting on iron steel chairs and listening to chants. Much time is wasted, a good thing is i can practice my body language reading. Managed to read a few but still i'm not very good at it.  The shooting competition was of my msot regret in this past ten days? Yes it was the most regretful thing. I didnt expect that i have enough time, so i didnt aim for the shooting competition. I have only managed to score a score of 93 which was fairly poor although i pass. I didnt try my best was the worst mistake i have commited!Now i truly wish for a time machine.
'Knowledge'  Pages withered, wise and old Pages flipped, dust fluttered high and low Worn and tattered hid its view from common man Centuries flickered in the light of words The wise wrote its course  And the lesser ones seek its enchantment
'Truth of reality'  As I sat on the sun set hill How the scenery seems mundane compared to you Looking into your enchanting eyes The presence of you gladdens my heart And your words sweeten my soul Time stopped parallel to space Holding your warm hands, seeped the strands of love  You are the one Who Iâm willing to sacrifice for upon the altar of love To brave through the flames of hell To don the shinning armor and be your knight To hear your sorrows and despairs To understand and love you   But when the dawn of reality shines upon me How I realize This was all an elusive dream There is no everlasting love No true love Every lie renders me apart Leaving me torn and tattered in an inevitable demise Dark devils fed my soul  And men mocked my foolishness  Winter now prey upon the land Leaving it bare and dead Life faded into the whispering wind

'Power of love'  They say angels birth from hell And devils warp from heaven No one knew the truth  When time fled into space And space into time None shelter it with concern  When love seeks to blind the heart of the lonely one None forsee its path  As the blinding of love unbind it self  The legends of knights in shinning armor reincarnated The soul of saints rebirth And the blessing of the gods shone once again Such awe and splendour  Hidden in the seed of love itself
'Flashes of life'  The winds blew the memories of the dead The past flashes like a train Emotions swelled to pain, sadness and joy Familiar faces carved into the graves Something emerged triumphant  The icy cold swept up in a torrent devouring the warm and lush air Like a man frozen with no feelings, thoughts nor love
I drunk myself with wine
They say there is nothing we cannot overcome in life What of times when steel of determination were cut open by the blade of love? Fallen so many times to dark pits Hurt, torn and shattered.  They say men should have no fear But to me the world was divided by fears Fears that could end everything Fears that others would not understand And I Fear that love could end a friend  Why must the tears linger for the winterâs chill? When will the sun shine the light? When will the rain wash away all the wounds?
'One chance'
It was her face which etched clearly in my mind
Shower of rain hid tears of a man       Clouds of bewilderment cover truth from lies      Where his smile&nbsp;secrete every sorrow
'Wounded&nbsp; soul'        &nbsp;
Love, present, past and the future   Where art thou? I left my dreams and hopes As the light shimmer of memories To a new land, I am there  Smashing the mirror,  I knew there was no way back Ruins of past and present lay before me Am i to find the one who i love and who love me not, in the midst of the sunless lands?  Where the wind seems an absent vacuum And the air tainted with death My home? I do not know There seems not a presence of a smoke nor shadow AS i tread lifeless waste I found a charcoal sheet Upon it wrote ' July 2 Year 3210 '
Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of withering, of tarnishing.
There were so many times When i look into her eyes but yet she shun them from me So many times Is there an end?  I knew i must leave But where? Perhaps somewhere where I can find love and care or perhaps a dark corner where i can cry alone I do not know..  Treading upon the silent street Hands warmed by my side Eyes cast down Every step leads me into the oblivion  The lingering pain in my heart  was my solitude companion and none could take it from me
Fatigue reverberate though the ear Deep lines of wrinkles carved in depth Dark lines embedded by the eyes Pensive thoughts swam in the hollow pool Influx of memories flooded like streams of river Yet tainted and impure it was Strands of white brushed softly against the wind And eyes faded to dark thoughts Where death stalks in the shadow Wisdom and knowledge dwindled into the vast ocean
urlLink    Are we the slave to our mind in life?Going towards directions that we knew were wrong, yet we went ahead.When you love someone even when you know there will only be pain, you yearn for her, listen to her voice, listen to her sorrows and sacrifice everything for her happiness. Slave we are to the mind, holding us to the chains of the overmind.Even when the one you love betrayed you, often we would just cling on to the illusion which our mind fed us.Love is such a strange feeling, no amount science or maths can measure or decipher what it feels like.Even words could not descibe....  'The ones you love most, is the ones who hurt you most'                                                    Prince of shadow...
Standing by the window Watching the bright stars shine their light Seeing her face in my mind Listening to the song of the nightingale Feeling the soft caress of the wind Dwelling in solitude  -- Pieces of puzzle Fixed on piece by piece  I knew so many answers Yet I fear to face them  -- Call me a liar, a fool But I hear not of them If there was a chance to spin the wheels of time To reach the tunnel of past and present To staunch wound which bleed in my heart  -- I would still say
When I saw everything cumbling before me
I'm at work eating lunch right now. A turkey scamich and a 'Courage' Sobe, those commies don't have Green Tea in the machine.   I have been thinking about writing another game but don't know what to write. I thought about doing a combat clone (like the old atari 2600 combat tank game) but that is a little too basic. A big problems I have with making games is my lark of a real artist. I gave up on my Rolling Thunder(tm) style game because it was really hard to stay excited about a bunch of odd chapes moving around on the screen.  I want to make an adverture type game with swords and stuff, but that's probably because I've had Zelda on the brain recently. I wonder if the Zelda games are named specifically after Zelda Fitzgerald...I guess I'll never know.  I like top down shooters, maybe I'll make another one of those. Earth Defender B was kinda lame, though it still ranks as my only game with sound effects.   For the people reading what kind of 2D game would you like to see, maybe a puzzle game? I don't know.
Well,I just got out of my last class of the semester. The final wasn't that hard except for one problem that I didn't do because I didn't even know where to start. The only class I'm worried about is Linear Algebra, or as it should be called 'Hard ass shit that I'll never remember and barely understand in the first place'. Man, I thought Calc 2 was tough. I'll take problems dealing with the surface area of graphs rotated into 3-space any day over these problems.   I really hope I get a C or B in this class. If I did worse on the final than I though then I could get a D. If that happens then this semester is a total waste. I need so many more math classes than anything else that to not pass one puts off my graduation by one more semester. The fact that I can't take any math classes this summer semester is, for me, a total travisty. Add to that the fact that I can't take ANY classes this summer and I'm pretty bummed about that. I was hoping to at least be able to take another yoga class or a programming class, or an art class. But no, nothing fits my work schedual.   I feel like I should want to party because I'm done with school for a little while but I really don't. As much as I can't stand individual people I like to be around people in general and school is a great way to do this. Now I'll have nothing to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I guess I could look for another job for the summer, but that would be lame too. OHH SHIT!! I got it, I can try being a dealer at a casino,I've always wanted to do that. Man that would be so sweet, I would be standing there and be all like 'Sir would you like to hit or stand...' and he would say 'Hit me' and I would give him another card and then I would probably say 'Ohh Sorry sir, I guess you shouldn't have hit' and then I'll take his money.  The only problem is that the only casino within driving distance (for me) is Casino San Pablo and playing blackjack there is like playnig golf underwater, it doesn't work the way it's supposed to and it just isn't fun.   Well, now I don't have anything to do for several hours. Ohh well, maybe I should just be depressed about it or something...
I can't believe that no one has commented on my Zelda post. Surely I'm not the only one that sees not only one, but the prospect of TWO new Zelda games as momentous news. Hmm...there is indeed something wrong with this world.   I was much later for work than normal today, my alarm clock may be broke or something. It better wake my ass on time for my comparitive politics final tomorrow.   I brought home a broken Palm m515 (or some similar model number) from work today with high hopes to take it apart and finally get a part I need to fix my Palm Zire 71. After 30 minutes of using various tools to break apart the Palm I finally extracted the tiny ribbon cable that I needed only to find that the connector on one end is different. What a bunch of damn communazi jerks. I was so let down. I wasn't even mad (at first). Oh well, it's not like I'll die without a PDA.
Yesterday I was driving somewhere and Mongolia crossed my mind. I realized that I knew nothing at all about the country. I have a vague notion that at one point in history mongol hordes swept across the land killing a bunch of people and stuff, but after they got beat back did they just become hermits? When was the last time you rememberanything happeneing there, or them doing anything at all in the world? Never.   After Mongolia I started thinking about Portugal. You never hear anything about Portugal either. I can understand Mongolia, it's way the hell out of the way near Siberia. It may even be part of Russia or China these days. But Portugal, man they're right there on the edge of Europe. I never hear anything, and I mean anything about portugal. I remember talking about WWII in school. We leraned that Spain was neutral during the war, we knew about how pretty much every European country stood, every one aside from Portugal. What happened to them, did they just vanish after the age of exploration....has anyone bothered to check!!! Since I'm obviously on the internet right now I know that I  could  just read about these places, but that would be too easy.   I think it's time that T.V. started informing us about countries that it doesn't really talk about already. We need to hear about Mongolia, Portugal, Estonia, and others I don't know that name of because I never hear about them. STOP THE GEOGRAPHICAL ELITISM.
I've just checked out the page for the new  Zelda  game and I have to say that I can't wait for it to come out. After the big pile of dog poo that was the Ledgend of the Windwaker I'm so glad that they decided to make the Zelda game that people want, not try to reinvent the series as a cartoon that you play.   At first, when looking at the screenshots, I was a little confused. I thought 'Hey, these are screenshots of 'A link to the past''. Then I realized that there wern't four Links in that game. However this game does indeed use many of the same graphics that were used in 'Link to the Past'. Hopefully it will also include the dark world and stuff, though this game looks prettty triforce free. Well, I guess you can't have everything, even though I really really would like to have the Triforce of wisdom....hint hint...   Oh yeah, stuff has happened in my life since yesterday, but it hardly seems worth talking about considering this Zelda news.   UPDATE: I have learned that there is another Zelda game  in the works . This one is 3D and looks like it will give little kinds and grown-ups alike nightmares that will put them off sleep for days. Just check out the screenshots, the one with Link fighting the GIANT ASS DEMON looked scarey as hell. I saw that guy and figured it had to be all over for Link, I really don't see how the little guy can pull off a victory aginst what looks like a 5 story building of a demon. Ohh man, I can't wait for this shit.....I wish I could freeze myself in carbonite or something untill this shit comes out.
Read this and rejoice (unless you live in South Carolina)   That's right folks, coming soon to a South Carolina near you, Christian Fundamentalism!!! They plan to break away from the nation to form an independant christian country, lets all pray that they get it. I'm sick of my federal tax dollars going to other states and having them still look down on California, it's like 'Hey assholes, we may have a screwy economy but we're still the piggy bank of the nation, where do you think you get your farm subsidies? Stalin Claus?'. Shit, we're (California) like the ugly step-child of the US, we give all our money and get back insults in return. Well it's time to rejoice that one of the other jerk states is going to bail. As an added bonus they are supposedly taking 50,000 nutjobs away from other states. Woohoo! You're going to stop taking our money and remove a bunch of nutjob chiristian fundamentalists...man...can I donate to your cause?
Well, I guess I lied. I have been updating this blog, more even than the others I know with blogs update theirs. I guess I should have called it 'Don't read my boring ass blog that has bad spelling and doesn't have any updates you will care to read because I never really do anything important anyways.', but that title seems a bit long.  Before I forget I'd like to give a big shoutout to  Isabella Wunder  for linking to me, though she could have used slightly better link text than 'Boring Ass' but I guess you have to take it how it comes. I'd also like to give a big shout out to  Miss Macy  and  Ember  I guess the Benicia crew is in da house or off the hook something.   Reguarding my dreams, it seems that my sunconscious picked up on my distaste for my recent dreams and game me a little treat last night. I had a dream I was playing a dope ass team based FPS similar to Tribes but with really good graphics and you could control players with your mind. However it wasn't all good, I had to put the game system together before I could play the game and even then my step dad was watching the whole time grunting about wanting to watch tv. Damn...don't get any peace anywhere...
Lately I've been having the more boring lame dreams ever. Being stuck trying to turn right at a country road stopsign, trying to play pool but not being able to find a pool que, arguing with someone about the use of mercenaries in the war in Iraq.  While I'm sure that all this is just dripping with deep meaning and insight both into my own mind and into the true nature of human society I just with that the way this insight were conveyed was a little more interesting or exciting. Why can't I have dreams where I'm superman or something and I just fly around and save people....that would be so rad.  Anyways, my subconscious mind aparently wants me to know that hiring mercenaries in Iraq is cheaper than sending our own troops because we don't have to pay for six months of training, during which time we have no extra troops. I hadn't thought about this point before having it told to me in a dream, odd that a part of me is spending time thinging about arguemnts to support things I'm against. What a jerk.
Sometimes I fancy myself as a fiction writer. And since fiction is more interesting than describing  the fact that I took some test yesterday or that I talked to someone the I hadn't seen in a while I  guess I can write some here and have almost no one read it anyway.   I removed the story I was writing, it was leaving the realm of bloggable short story and entering the realm of longish tale. Plus it was boring and uninspired. I still like the idea of the story with only really reflects the experiances I've had in office work.   It's funny how you got to places and everything seems to run smoothly, but then you get a job there and you realize that it's like one big balancing act and it's amazing that everything doesn't come crashing down all the time. My favorite was when I work in customer service. Man, I didn't know crap about the products people were asking me about, no one did. Ohh well.
I just read this story and I have to say that I don't normally get this pissed of at the sad state of affairs anymore, but this one really got me going. It seems that this principal fancies hiseld as the thought police for the school. One person wrote a poem he doesn't agree with and not only does he call the student un-American, fires the teacher that sponsers the poetry club, terminates the teaching of poetry in the school but also removes all student art from the walls of the school and doesn't renew the contracts of teachers that leave art in their classrooms. I can't believe that this commie has the nerve to call someone un-American.
Unluckily for you you have somehow landed here, on my blog. I fail to grasp why one would want to read my blog, however I have to admit that I don't exactly have the most favorable view of blogs that can be had. I have been known to say, and still say that they are one of the biggest wastes of time known to man, and one that offers the fewest rewards. So, why then am I posting this? Well, for two reasons; one, I wanted to post comments on another blog that doesn't allow anonymous comments, and two, I'm the one wasting your time. I have to think about my life anyways, now I'm making you do it too.....ha ha, sucker.
After reading  this  news story I knew I had to write about it for a couple different reasons. First off, as long as she isn't butt ugly I doubt many boys were very thrown by this punishment. I know I know, it damages them physomindaly or something but come on, how many boys alreay have little fantasys about their teachers and now they have one asked if then want to be caned or to suck on her breasts. Man, some guys would shoot their loads just thinking about that setup.   All joking aside it always irks me how little attention is payed to woman on boy sexual abuse. I know this took place in another country but it happens here and it never gets the same kind of media coverage or reaction than when the perpetrator is male.
It's strange to think that every person is like a walking universe. Every person sees things through their own perspective and with their own thoughts coloring what they see. You would think that with all this uniqueness of thought and perspective going around there would be many different personalities and a real sense of individualism to go with it, but there's not. For as far as people have gone group affiliation still seems to be a driving force in society. It's like once we stopped living in tribes and towns got too large for everyone to know everyone else we had to create tribes of our own, and in order for these tribes to have meaning and consistency in our large society each member of these neo-tribes must conform to an even stricter set of guidelines than would be necessary in an average tribal society.   It's funny how every group seems to think that they are unique and that they are true individuals, however most members of a group almost always dress the same, or at least very similarly. I swear to god that if I see one more of those 'You laugh at me because I am different, I laugh at you because you're all the same' shirts I'm going to barf all over the person wearing it and them that I'm laughing at them because they think they're 'different' while wearing a shirt that could have it's own wearers convention I've seen so many people wearing it.   Every person has the capacity to have so many interests it's not funny, sometimes I think I bore people to death talking about my own, but I've noticed that many people never seem to have any real interests. It's almost like people are afraid of being kicked out of their neo-tribe if they express an interest in something that none of the others like. Each group has it's own safe area it could be literature, music, clothes, style, whatever, and you will often hear people talking about those things, but not so much about other things.   I think it's important to note that I'm not talking about friends, there is a difference between a group like the neo-tribe that I'm talking about, and a group of friends. It's also important to note that my friends kick ass and that I'm not talking about any of them.  However, I am talking about many people I do to school with at DVC. It's strange to walk around campus and hear people talking about the dumbest most meaningless shit. It's even stranger to try to talk with people and try to talk about meaningful things, not like the meaning of life or anything just about things that actually interest people (what they plan to do after school, where they grew up, hobbies...), and have them get all uncomfortable and leave. I don't know if people think I'm hitting on them or what but almost every time I talk to someone like an adult with full comprehension abilities rather than talk to them like they are children (how are you? I like your hat? the sky is nice...) they end up looking at me like I'm nuts.  The other end of that spectrum are people that try to talk about the craziest thing they can to prove how different they are. Somehow these people annoy me even more than people that talk about nothing because it just seems that they are forcing something that isn't there. It would be as if I talked about the goatse man with everyone I met.
This is kind of a continuation of a previos story line in my blog and has to do with my job. If my readers will remember I have been in trouble with my boss for not doing a good job and coming in late and basically being a bad horrible person. Well imagine my surprise when I came to work today to find a 'Spirit Award' sitting on my desk. These are given out to employees that capture the spirit of the hospital workplace and go above and beyond what is expected of them. Do they know who they gave it to? The best part is that it can be handed out by any manager and I got one from my bosses boss. This doesn't change my work situation at all, but man was I surprised.
I've been working on my new game for a little while now it's coming along okay. I have a lot of good ideas and am starting to flush them out before actually setting about writing them into code. Recently I've been working on implementing a 2D SDL based particle engine. I've had a few problems because unless I use single pixels for particles I can't figure out how to color them. So I would have to have different particles drawn in each color I would want , or have all particles be the same color. It's so much easier to do in OpenGL. Half the game effects I have planned are particle effects so if I can't figure out how to do them in SDL I may have to do the partiels in OpenGL, I know there is a way to use OpenGL with an SDL window, I just han't read up on how yet.   Right now I'm working on this game less than any others I have worked on in the past. By this point in time on my missile command clone I had already finished an OpenGl particle engine and setup all the particle effects I would use in that game. My lack of work is mostly because I spend more time playing pool than doing almost anything else, aside from sleeping and 'working'.   I need a laptop that can boot and get on my network in about 5 seconds, that way I could just transfer to my laptop and take it with me everywhere. But it's too much work shuffeling code around all the time, and wanting to go out but having to wait for the laptop top boot and then copy over the files. If the USB on my home computer actually worked I guess I could just use a thumb drive to move things around. But alas it does not work. ASUS makes some great boards, but this one isn't exactly the greatest. Maybe I should buy a new motherboard and processor and shuffel this one to my windows system. Hmmmm....my birthday is coming and a nice new ASUS board with a gig of RAM would look mighty fine under the tree. With a nice P4, ohh man, that would be so sweet. The only thing sweeter would be a dual processor board with TWO nice P4s nad TWO gigs of RAM and maybe a 10 gig solid state hard drive.   Well, time to go play some pool I guess.  At least I did write a few lines of code today.
Yesterday was, all in all, a pretty good day. Even if certain people that needed certain rides to work from certain hospitals didn't give me money for gas or the bridge. I took the oppratunity to go to lunch with my Mom since I was in the East Bay anyways and it's been a while since I've gone to lunch with her. I then went to Cody's Books in Berkeley and looked at (Surprise!) some books. I bought one. For the purpose of suspence I will not reveal what the book that I bought was untill a later date.   I went home, played some video games, and took a long nap. That nap ended up screwing me in the end. I woke up, went to Kinders and talked to a couple friends for about 5 minutes before heading off to a pool tournament. I ended up taking second place and wining a heafty sum of $35. Not too shabby considering that I got lucky in quite a few games. But that's just the way it goes, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes it gets you...I guess I got it last night, but it wont be long before it gets me back. What a jerk.   I ended the night be getting a sticky Sobe from Wolves and talking to Miss Macy for a little bit. I went home, played some more video games and went to bed to try to sleep, something which I failed miserably at. It's now the morning of today and I got about one or two hours of sleep. I guess the bear did get me back...while I was in bed, he is a jerk!
Well, today is my last day of forced vacation from work and I'm kinda glad to go back because the heat is killing me. I wanted to do more with the past week then just hand out like normal. But It's hard to find people that want to get out and do stuff early in the day, especially when you're not so sure you want to yourself. Is it getting hotter!!! It's 4:00pm, I figured it would start cooling off but my house defies me again and shows it self for the oven that it is. Roasted griffenjam is on the menu tonight.   I got the new Zelda game, Four Swords Adventures, last week. It came with a free shirt and I'm wearing it now, for the third time this week, I did wash it yesterday though so that is no excuse to stay away  from me. The game is alot like the new Harry Potter movie. It's really good for what it is, but don't try to compare it to anything else in the series (or in the movies case the book) because it just wont live up. In practice it's very much like Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Which was the worst Final Fantasy game ever. The thing I hat...dislike the most is that you cant just walk around the world at your leisure. You have to select a specific are to go to, then select an available section, and clear it to move on to the next area. I don't like games that are too controlling, let me do my own thing dammit.   A Link to the Past kicks this games ass so hard the bruises may never go away, but like I said, it's fun for what it is.    My, and Isabella's, birthday is coming up soon. I'm wondering if my dad will call, I doubt he will but I hope he does. It's normally pretty easy to milk an absent parent for good gifts or cash, as long as they feel bad about being absent. However I didn't even get a card for Christmas so I think that I may be out of luck. I wonder what the etiquette is with crappy dads when it comes to the rest of the family. My Grandmother, his mom, is having everyone at her house for her birthday soon and I was invited. I want to go, but I don't know. I always get the feeling that I'm a little set apart from them, except for Grandma.   For example, I'm the only liberal in a very conservative family, I'm also the only non-baptized one. I also know that if I go I'll just get even more mad at my dad than I already am. Like last time I went up. Some cousins and I were playing softball and then one of them said something about playing softball with my dad recently. This was funny because my dad lives in Arizona and she doesn't. That means that my dad came to California and at some point played softball with her (something he hasn't done with me) and never even called me. Before that day I thought it was the entire family that he ignored but during that trip I found out that it was just me. Everyone kept asking me about what I thought about things he's been up to or have happened to him. All of it was news to me. Ohh well, what can I do, but if he thinks he's getting my liver or any other organ someday he can think again.
I don't want to make a habit of posting news stories but  this  is one I felt I just had to share. It would seem that in the year 2003, the second full year of our all out war on terrorism, the amount of terrorism used in the world actually increased. They tried to lie about it and say that the level of terrorism had dropped lower than it has been in 34 years, but someone called them on it and now they look pretty dumb.   This is exactly what I have been saying will happen. A war on terrorism will only increase the number of people that are willing to use it to acheive their aims.
Okay. So, in my last post I said I had a meeting with my boss that I thought was going to be bad. It was. Due to my non-stop lateness and over the top internet useage I've been suspended for two days. While I think that suspension was a little harsh I could use a little time off. The only thing that bugs me is that I'm not the only one in my department that does this stuff. I'm just the most obvious one. Hell one person plays flash games all day. Another gets off the phone from yelling at his wife just long enough to call someone regaurding his after hours work. Ohh well, I guess that's what it means to be low man on the totem pole.   Enough about that, now it's time to tell about me being hasseled by the man. The other night I was driving home from playing some pool and I see a cop driving around, I say to Isabella, 'He's going to pull me over'. Low and behold he does. I wasn't doing anything wrong, nothing at all. He tell me that the computer says that my registration is expired. Just to make it totally clear, I had registred my car a week previous and considering that the police had a connection to the DMV computers right in their car I find it hard to believe that my registration is showing up as expired. He eventually lets me go.  Last night, just two nights after the first incident, after leaving a pool tournament (which I didn't win) I see a cop, and he sees me walking to my car. He pulls around in a parking lot and waits for a few seconds watching me, then he leaves and goes up the street out of sight. He's out of sight for all of five seconds and I see his front end creep around the corner watching me start my car and let it warm up for a minute. The second I drive off he's on my ass. I  LOVE  it when cops tailgate me! So I try to be carefull not to do anything stupid but in the end I kinda do. I'm at a red light and and I see a car coming but it looks far enough away that I think I can safely turn right. The cop didn't agree. He pulled me over and asked for my license. This piqued my interest because he didn't ask for my registration. I would have thought that if my registration was showing up as expired he would have said something about it, but even after checking the computer and coming back with my license he didn't ask for it. He just told me to yeild next time and let me go.   God I love the cops in Benicia. I live in Vallejo and drive around that city all the time, at all hours but never get pulled over there. I go one town over and it happens quite often.
I have a meeting with my boss in about 10 minutes. I always hate meeting with authority figures. I have a feeling that this will be bad. It's a follow up to a meeting I had previously with her when we discussed how late I always am, I've been late alot lately. In my defense I've been sick lately and it's harder to get up and around early when you're sick. I don't know how to tell her that without sounding like I'm just making excuses, which is something I really don't want to do. I guess it doesn't matter really. This place isn't known for handing out raises so it's not like I'm going to miss a chance at a raise because I'm a bad employee, and I don't think I'm quite fireable yet. Though that would really suck. I'd hate to have to turn to selling my body to pay rent.
It's funny how much time can change you without you realizing it. When I was 17 I had the world figured out; I was the person I really wanted to be and couldn't imagine ever wanting to change. I was going race people on the feeway with my VW Bug for the rest of my life. I was going to do other things too, but I was sure that racing my bug was going to be a big part of my life forever. Well, two accudent later I no longer had a bug to race and it's really hard to look like a straigt up hardcore pimp driving a Bonneville (and it was so easy in a VW Bug!).   Now that I have a car that can race I find that I never actually want to do it. Maybe I'm just afraid that I'll get in a wreck and die, I mean how fast could I really go in a VW Bug?    Heh, actually it's funny for how much one changes, how much of them stays the same. I remember when I was young, maybe in third grade, I used to be afraid that when I grew older I would turn into someone else. That somehow the voice inside my head would be different and not connected to the one I had at that time. I was afraid of being older, like 15 or 16, I didn't know how to do it then. It all seemed very scarey. I would be expected to do things and know things about the world. Like how to pay taxes and register cars. I would be expected to know how to SPELL!!! Well, I guess I can't get everything right. When I made it to 15 the last thing I wanted was to be 18. There were breif moments when I wanted the freedom that being 18 would bring but those moments didn't last long. I didn't have a large college fund, $1000 doesn't even go far at community college, and I knew that none of my parents would be kicking down the many thousands that it would take to send me to school. I also knew that my grades weren't good enough to merrit and kind of scholership worth talking about. This all ment that I would have to work for a living when I turned 18 (which actually turned out to be when I was 16) and even thought I hadn't done it yet I knew one thing anout work, it was for suckers. Ten jobs later I have only confirmed that, work really is for suckers.   I know that a blog is supposed to be like a diary. A log of events in your life, but I find my typical day to be too mundane to talk about. I don't mean to diminish the importance I place on hanging out with my friends thought. I saw a few of my friends yesterday and last night and I really enjoy it every time I'm around my friends. Whether it's going to the mall and getting a bit to eat or sitting around shooting pool and trying to win stuffen animals the time I spend with my friends is the most important time in my life. That is something that has never changed about me and I hope that it never does.
I just got back from see the new Harry Potter movie and I guess I'll say some words about it. I wont try to spoil anything but if your looking to be surprised then dont read this post (like anyone reads these posts anyways).   Overall I thought the movie was good for what it was however it pays the book absolutely no service at all. Some events are out of order, happen in entirely different places, or are completely missing. Unless it was after the credits the trainride home wasn't even in the movie and that means that pidwidgen (spelling?) wasn't either, sorry Ron I guess Errol will have to do for now.   Quiddich was completely forgotten about after the first match, which is too bad because I was really looking forward to seeing Harry's patronus run down Malfoy. Actually many things arn't in the movie at all, which I was expecting but it seems that too much is missing.   Time also seems to move very quickly. Before you know it it's christmas time, but strangely enough it never actually is christmas. It seems that opening presants on christmas is a feature of every book, but it didn't make it into the movie. Sorry guys, no sweaters from Mrs. Weasley or any  other preasents .   One thing I was sorry wasn't in the movie was the lack of normal interaction. You never really see the students in class unless there is a major event in that class. The books deal not only with the main story line but also with the life of Harry and his friends in school, this is something that is completely missing from the movie.   I still liked it none the less.
All my life I've had lucid dreams, dreams which you can control, however when I have them it's fairly rare that I realize that I'm dreaming at the time. Ladt night is a perfect example. I had a dream that I was arrested for some reason and thrown into jail, this was a lucid dream, however it's hard to take control when you don't realize that you have any; I thought it was real. I was totally freaking out, wondering what the hell was happening. However it was that bad because every time I wanted anything I would find it right away. I was a little thirsty and instantly found a coke machine, I wanted something to do and found a rec-room filled with pool tables. I wanted something to eat and I just all of a sidden had food, I don't even know where it came from. After a little while it turned out that I was in the coolest jail ever. Somehow I missed that fact that there was a surprisingly small number guys in this jail and the majoiry of the population was filled with hot girls. How did I not reailze that I was dreaming.   I'm staying home from work today, my sickness I mentioned before has not gone away and I figure that if I have to deal with it for a while I may as well take a day of work. This sucks more than is immedatly apperent to anyone that doesn't work for communists. At the hospital I for at your sick time and your paid vacation all come out of the same bucket. The time I'm taking now is subtracting from my paid vacation time....that is so lame it makes me even sicker. It's actually a very bad policy to have in a hospital. I wonder how many people, in order to conserve vacation time, go to work sick....in a hospital...go to work sick...sick...to their work....their work which is where tons of people are that shouldn't be around anyone that is sick that they don't have to be. Ohh well, I don't make the rules, I just try my best to not follow them.   I saved some of the best news for last. Last night I won a pool tournament. Brought in a wooping $69. Woohoo! Actually I got quite lucky, and you can believe me when I say that because I think false modesty is one of the fakest things since McDonalds cheeseburgers. It really rips me up when I know that someone is trying to be modest and saying things I know they really don't think.  Well, I have to go, I told Isabella and MaterialGirl that I would come hang with them.  Don't do anything I wouldn't do....and if you do call me first so I can come and watch...
As you may have noticed by the fact that it is plainly stated above, I am in a bad mood. I couldn't sleep at all last night and when I did drift off for a short period of time I had a strange dream about  Optimus Prime and I hiding in a room on a space station that looked surprisingly like the pharmacy at the hospital I work in. It seemed that most of the Autobots were being mind controlled and they were looking for us. Optimus wasn't in high spirits and neither was I.   So, I'm tired and cranky and I have a sore throat and so when I got to work I decided to do what any sane person would do at work and try to plan my class schedual for next semester. This turned out to be the wrong thing to do on an already bad day. Budget cuts at school have now hit home for me. There is a greatly decreased number of Tuesday/Thursday classes and some of my favorite teachers arn't teaching the classes I need to take, which is okay because the classes arn't at time I can take them anyways.   Why is it patriotic to blindly support every war Bush takes us into but it's okay to let education funding slide. Wanna talk about patriotism, how about putting some stock in this countries future and educating people for a change. Our big bad weapons wont mean shit when others develop energy shields and were left behind because were a nation of dumbasses that don't care about funding education.   I was going to talk about a bunch of other stuff but I just got blindsided by my bad day. I need to talk to a counselor about what classes I can take for my major now that I can't take the math class I need or the programming class I need.
Last sunday was the anniversary of the day of my birth. It's not a global holiday yet, but I'm working on it. I had a pretty good time. I had gone to Lake Tahoe with my parents, my sister and her husband. I won some money on the first night I was there, that was pretty cool. We went to Nevada and saw some sights, including the town that Bonanza was filmed in. Then we came back and went out on a dinner cruise in the lake. It was pretty cool. The food was alright except for the fact that no matter how anyone ordered the steak it came out medium well. But considering that it also came out within five minutes of ordering it I have an inkeling that it may have been already cooked and would have been hard to uncook it a little to make it med. rare.         The boat sports a small glass bottom that is too small to be of any use to anyone that isn't just trying to check on the color of the water under the boat.  But it was a nicvee trip altogether and I enjoyed the views of the lake. I took lots of pictures, as people normally do in that kind of setting, then in five years I'll probably do what countless others have done, I'll look at those pictures and wonder where the hell they were taken and what exactly I was taking a picture of, because aside from trees and water there is nothing remarkable in the pictures.         After we got back we all went gambling. The idea was to go together but we ended up going our seperate ways after long. I did well but wasn't making the millions I wanted to so I quit and walked to a pub that sports a pool table and figured I'd shoot a couple games. This was a great decision it turns out, because I met two very nice girls from Oakland in the pub. We shot a few games then decided to go gamble a little, but on the way to the casino stopped off at a club called the Cabo Yabo or something or other. Now, I don't drink, smoke, or have sex with everyone I meet so the clubs have never really been my thing but we were having a good time none-the-less. I turned 26 standing in that club. We stayed there for a little over an hour then went to do some gambling. I lost a little money ($6.50). And at 2:30am figured that it was time to go to bed. I bid my new friends farewell and left for the warm, if not lsightly stiff, embrace of my bed in my temporary home. I should have gotten their numbers but I didn't. Ohh well, maybe I'll see them again.          In the morning I went to a breakfast buffet with my family and had a pretty good breakfast. After that we gambled a little more, I lost thirty dollars. Then everyone left, one group at a time, with me leaving last. I came home ans went out with some friends to a local bar. Aparentally I spent the whole night muggin' (staring in a menacing way) people, or so I was told, repeatadly.
For those that don't know, and since everyone that reads this knows me I'm talking to no one that's likely to see this, I play in a pool tournament every thursday night. Last week I did pretty bad, the word dismal comes to mind. Losing is one thing, but missing a bunch of easy shots is another. To put it plainly; I just plain sucked.  However this was a new week and my sucking seemed to have abated because I came out swinging this time and I was dropping fools like that's what they were made for.  Well, I guess I could remember it that way if I were drinking or doing some heavy drugs. In reality I got lucky in alot of games and owe many victories to the person I was playing choking or getting really lucky with a leave.  My luck ran out in the last two games. This is a double elimination tournament so that means everyone can lose twice and the winner of the winners bracket plays the winner of the losers bracket. This means that the last person in the winners brackets has to be beaten twice by the last person in the losers bracket, which is exactly what happened, with a little help from me. For me the only important shot in both those games was the last on of the second game.  The eight ball was sitting on the side pocket and I had a clear shot at it. I took carefull aim and hit with just a little right english to make sure that I didn't follow it into the side pocket and took my shot. I had hit to hard and the right english carried the cue ball right down the table and into the corner.  Ohh well, it happens. Sometimes I feel like the whole thing is a luck game anyways.  And that's all I have to say about that.
So, today I did stupid shit like waking up and going to work and coming home and stuff, then I did something pretty cool. I went to see some bands play at Blakes in Berkeley.  I ended up going by myself which is cool with me, but stuff like this is always more fun with friends. Ohh well, at least no one I know saw me jogging down telegraph trying to find a place with a public bathroom I could take a crap in and not die from some disease five minutes later.         I got there rather early and the show started rather late, which ment that I did alot of standing around outside by myself before the show started. Yet again, I don't mind being alone. My dislike for humanity as a whole compells me to no talk to most other people and since I'm a pretty momentumy person my non-talkingness carries over to pretty much everyone, even people I might like to meet. However this doesn't stop crazy people from talking to me and telling me about how they think that Kurt Cobain was alot like Earnest Hemmingway because both blow their brains out. But figuring that you just have to take it as it comes I just smile and say something like 'Wow, I never saw it that way.'.         The bartender at blakes, the girl that works on the main level, has a very strange thing going on. I normally have a pretty good feeling about what people are like, what kind of person they are and so on, and this girl game me a really strange feeling, but in a good way, kind of like the Buddah or something. I wanted to ask her a bunch of questions and try to figure her out but I figured that some creapy guy in a green hat asking where she grew up and what her favorite color is might seem at best like I'm some creapy guy that is hitting on her, and at worst like some creapy loser that is wearing a strange hat and hitting on her.  She was also cute and smiled alot, I like people that smile at people they don't know, I do it all the time but rarely get one in return.         The first band that played was pretty good. There were from the East Coast and played something that sounded very much like L.A. ska. I don't remember their name though and I didn't care to get their CD I kinda had the feeling that they were jerks. This was confirmed when I saw them mocking the band that played after them, Sputter Doll. Sputter Doll played a great set, I really loved it. I felt kind of bad though because all the other bands were pretty much straight ska bands and here they were playing punk. I  got the feeling that most of the people there weren't really digging on them too much, which is too bad because they sounded great. I wanted to get their new CD but they packed up and left before the band after them finished their set. Which brings me to Warsaw. I got a Warsaw Cd back in '97 and thought they were pretty cool. I had no idea they were still around untill today. They played a great set with a bunch of original sounding ska, and even had someone playing a conch shell in one song. It was great to see all the people dancing and haveing a good time, I know I was. However I really had been hoping to hear some of the songs on the CD I have, but they only played recent stuff.  Ohh well. Like I said, gotta take it like it comes, no use complaining about it.        After they were done I left, I didn't really care to stick around for the next band. I drove to the Pastime to play a little pool. Which is exactly what I did, play a little pool; two games to be exact. Once I got there I realized that I was too tired to stay for long. I played and them came home, sucessfully getting out of Benicia without getting pulled over.
Last night I was sitting on the can and had the thought that it might be a good idea to write about something that happened to me years ago, just over ten years ago in fact. It's about the first time I fell in love, or at least thought I did. I'll leave out many of the boring details because I'm told that they, rather than adding depth and interest, just make my stories long and drawn out. I was a youngster staying at a hotel/casino with a parent. This meant than while my parent was gambeling and doing whatever I didn't have shit to do. However I was a horny youngster so I went to hand out by the pool, I didn't have a swimsuit, but I figured that girls probably did. Well, while sitting by the pool I noticed a girl around my age, who actually turned out to be a couple years younger, sitting with her grandparents. She was very attractive in an offbeat sort of way; I couldn't really put my finger on it or figure out why I thought she was so attractive but you don't really questions those things too much do you, if you think someone is hot you don't really care why. Well, being a little wuss I knew that I wouldn't talk to her, especially no in front of her grandparents, so I didn't really think about it. Now, it becomes important to point out that I am, and always have been, a big ice eater. In my earlier years it wasn't uncommon for me to just get a cup full of ice and munch on that for a while, something that I did at exactly this point in my story. I got up and got a cup full of ice and sat back down. About five minutes after that the girl got up and got some ice as well, on her return trip to her seat she commented to me about how great the ice there was. This shocked the hell out of me because at that point, and to a certain degree to this day, I had the feeling that I was pretty much invisible and went unnoticed unless I walked into someone or something.   At that moment nothing more came of that. Her grandparents and her eventually got up and left, I had nothing to do so stayed there for a while. There was a view of the river nearby from the pool area, so I checked that out for a while. I eventually got bored and decided to walk around elsewhere. I left the pool area and hit the elevator button, which was right on the other side of the door from the pool area, when I heard someone say hi to me from behind. It was that girl, we talked for a little bit (untill the elevator got there). It turned out she was waiting for her grandparents. When the elevator arrived I really wished I could keep talking to her but I didn't know if I would look crazy if I called up an elevator and didn't get into it so I left. I kicked myself all the way to whereever I went after that.  I did something, ate dinner, blaa blaa for the next few hours untill it was almost time for bed. I told my parent that I wanted to go for a walk, which was true. I was told to be back by 10pm. I went back to the pool, mostly because I wanted to see the girl, but also because I enjoy being outside at night and looking at the stars, even to this day I can sit outside and look at the stars for hours and not get bored. When I got there I found that I was the only one there, I sat down and thought about things for a while, then a door opened and she came out. We talked for a couple hours about all sorts of stuff. I found out that she was from Seattle and her grandparents lived in Sacramento. I can't remember her name (I'm terrible with names) and for some reason it completely slipped my mind to try to get her address.  When midnight rolled around we both figured that we were probably in quite a bit of trouble for staying out so late and went back to our rooms. I was happy that I had met such a cool person but sad because I knew I would never see her again. I was actually depressed about this for a few days. I wrote in a journal at this time in my life and I'll repete here the advice I wrote in my journal.   If you take the time to get to know the perfect person, at least make sure to get her address.
Well, I've been working on my new game, Earth Defender C, for the past few weeks. I do it a little at a time, I'm not a very hardcore developer these days. Think I got this far with Earth Defender B within the first two or three days. But this game is going to be better developed and have a special quality that Earth Defender B didn't quite have, this game will be fun to play. Since I don't do much artistically that I can share with others I figure all I really have right now is my games so I'm going to post a screenshot so all can see my fledgeling game in all its glory. Before you start dissing my game, or me, remember this is still very early on and that I'm not an artist. Also the map isn't exactly laid out for looks right now.l..blaa...blaaa, here is the pic.
Well, I'm trying to sign up for classes and I'm having some problems. It seems that thanks to budget cuts all the classes I want are at times I can't take them. I can accept this, for now. So I'm thinking that I will talk to a counselor and see what classes I need that are in times I can take them. So I call up and try to make an appointment. This was my big mistake. I expected a department in a college to do something that makes sense (give advice to students before a semester starts). I was told that for now they are only giving appointments to people that are already taking summer classes. So in other words they are only helping people that already have classes and don't really need help. I was told that I couldn't make an appointment until school actually started, and even then I can only make the appointment once school starts, it would be weeks before I could actually see one.   WTF!!! So they only counsel people that have already made mistakes. Hey, glad you made an appointment to come see me, ohh look at this,  you took all the wrong classes and wasted this semester, should have talked to someone before signing up for these, but now it's too late to even add classes because not many teachers will let you after the first week...  THIS MAKES NO SENSE!! Why only help people after it's too late for the help to do any good! Why are there no sections of Calculus III at a time when I can take them, not only at DVC but also at Contra Costa Community College, Solano college, and Napa College. Are there any others I can try?   And I'm tired of people that use its when they mean it's, if you want to say it is use IT'S DAMNIT!!! The same goes with your, and you're. And what's with Yellow Cabs anyways, so what if it's yellow, doesn't have to be in the damn name does it!
I just read  this  and found it pretty sad. This kid wants to go kill Muslims. That's it, kill Muslims. God I hope they don't let him into any branch of the armed forces, just what we need, some kid with his own Muslim killing agenda. This is sad on so many levels it's not even funny.   Normally when someone gets mad at things like immigrants or people of other races it mostly fear that drives it. Normally fear that these people aren't actually inferior to them and can do things just as well as they can. How many times do you hear highly skilled people go on about immigrant problems...not alot, because they know they are secure in their job and aren't afraid that someone that isn't acclimated to the culture and can't speak the language well is going to come and take their job away. As far as I'm concerned if you can be replaced by someone that can't speak English and only just got here then you probably didn't deserve your job in the first place.   I also love how the same people that talk about wanting unfettered capitalism and a laissez faire government are also the same people that hate on the illegals. I'm sorry but you can't go on about the glory of the free market one minute then talk shit about people that are the living expression of it the next. Illegals work harder for less money than most of this country, they had to go through more shit just to get those jobs and they risk far more thanany of us ever will just by coming here in the first place. They embody free market capitalism, they risk everything for a shot at a better life, and they are willing to work hard for it. And because of them we have cheap fruits and vegetables. I don't hear anyone complaining about that, you never hear anyone say 'Damn those illegals, these oranges should cost 10 times this much!!!'.   The funny part of it is that we, as a country, support the illegals every day. If you buy fruit chances are an illegal picked it. Do you shop at Walmart? Guess who got busted for using a company that hires illegals.   Just like my answer to anything you don't like in our society, if you want to do something the only real way to make an impact is to boycott. If you don't like illegals then don't buy anything they pick, shop anywhere they clean, or pay them for anything. Personally I don't care about illegals, like I said, I know they aren't taking my job. And I'm pretty secure in knowing that most Americans are too lazy, stupid, and cheap to actually do anything effective about the illegal 'problem' so all they will keep doing is talking shit.   Another thing I love in this country is people thinking they are better than anyone else on Earth just because they are born here. I'm sorry, but this kid has no room to talk about what other people should do or about how they don't deserve to live here. I've got news for you kid, no one born deserves to live here, some of us are just lucky. And before you start acting like the popular kid keeping the nerds out of your party I have to ask you, what have you done to make this country great? People go on and on about how great this country is, and I don't disagree, this is a great country, but it's not through their actions that it's great. It's thanks to people like Thomas Edison, The Wright brothers, and, thought I REALLY hate to say it Henry Ford that this country is great. It has nothing to do with John Q. Asshole that does alot of talking but doesn't do shit worth talking about, every country has those. Until you do something worth talking about I don't really want to hear your views about who should be here and who shouldn't because for all we know the child of that fruit picker that came here illegally will invent something that will allow the U.S. to maintain it's dominance in the world. It always amazes me how a country of immigrants could have so much hatred for them.
As the title suggests I had a great weekend, I'm just sorry that it had to end. I wont go into all the specifics but I hung out with bunches of friends and family and even saw La Plebe play at the Phoenix Theatre in Petaluma. I got to see my friend from the good ol' state of Oregon and her twins. I think of the twins, Charlotte, is starting to like me but Maggie still seems pretty wary of me.   I got to see two parades this year, Vallejo and Benicia's. I think I can say without too much hometown bias that Vallejo's was the better of the two, although both shared quite a few floats. I have a feeling that is the reason that Benicia has it's parade on the third, because if it did it on the fourth many of it's floats would be in Vallejo. Benicia's after parade festivies beat Vallejo's handsdown though. In Vallejo the Vallejo symphony plays after the parade and there is like a mini-crafts fair. In Benicia there is literally dancing in the street as a rock band plays various other bands hits. I saw no crafts booths, but there were a few food stands. There is one thing that Benicia is missing and that is a Ducky Durby. I know I bought a duck from a person in Vallejo's parade, thought I didn't go to the actual race. Maybe my duck won, that would kick so much ass. I would even love to get fourth place....hmmm, I don't know what happened to my duck ticket though, well they have my name and address.   Well, this was a great weekend and I'm glad that I got to spend it with family, old friends, new friends, and people that are just becoming friends. If every weekend were like this life would be grand and almost any lame ass job would be bearable because I would know that I had the weekend and great friends and family to look forward to.
I know no one care about this, but I will post about it anyways.  I have been working on my game and it's going somewhat well. Since I posted that screenshot I have added such wonderfull and awe inspireing things as bullets, and one enemy that doesn't have the ability to fire at you yet, which is okay because it's mostly just a flying bomb itself, it has been named a spin-drone. Mostly because it's a drone, and it spins, or it should. Right now it just looks like a tweeker robot thing that is makeing strange movements that don't really resemble spinning at all.   I am such a bad pixel artist it isn't even funny. Well, for other people it's funny, and I guess I do laugh sometimes at my own crappy art, so I guess I should say that i'm such a bad pixel artist that it's only occasionally funny, and most time the horrors oof my art are beyond humor. Maybe I'm going over the top a little, but I don't think so.   I'd post another screenshot but I'm lazy and no one would care so why bother. Plus the game isn't that visually different yet. I need to work on the HUD a little more and take all the debugging text of the screen, and add another enemy or two, then I'll post another screenie for you all to ignore.  BTW if anyone that may be reading this is a pixel artist and wants to have their name in the credits of this game post your e-mail addy and I'll get back to you.   A large chunk of the coding for this game is done, everything I have do has been done with the idea of code re-use in mind. All I have to do is add support for a few things and the buld of the game will be finished, so if an artist were to join up now if would be quick easy game credits to show their art in action. So, after all I'm really the one helping you out, not the other way around.
So this week I took a break from doing absolutely nothing with my life to go to Linuxworld and try to waste my time getting cheap Linux related junk that will collect dust in my house. It was a great success. On Tuesday LoveLostLibra came with my and we made the rounds hitting up every booth we could, gaining information and looking for cheap crap like it were the holy grail. Some products I had a real interest in, Blackduck had a pretty cool app for programming teams, and others that I couldn't care less about, ahem...veritas..., but only talked to to get the cheap crap.   LLL and I had a pretty good time, I think (maybe he's really plotting to get back at me for boring him to tears for bringing to a Linux trade show, who knows), Intel threw a pretty nice after-party that had some great food and a pretty cool 80's cover band. They also had a bunch of free-to-play pool tables. We all had great fun and ate and drank and were merry and stuff. Then we took BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit, it's a train) back to where I parked earlier. Let me tell you that was the longest BART ride I ever had. I had to pee so bad my teeth were swimming in it. I ended up having to go in the women's restroom because there was someone in the men's room and there was no time for politeness for formality. If the women's had been locked I would have been peeing into a trashcan or something.   Thursday I went back to Linux world on a solo mission of justice. I had been cheated of a great bounty of cheap shit the previous trip and I was coming back to clean house, and clean house I did. Four T-shirts, a bank, a mini-USB hub, enough mints and pens to make Mr. T cry. I especially liked the end of the conference on this, the last, day. The roles were reversed, vendors were practically begging people to take their stuff so they wouldn't have any left over. I can't think of one piece of swag that I missed.  There was no after party however, ohh well. Can't win em all ehh? For lunch I ate at a 'Mexican' restaurant in the Metreon. I had a chicken quesadilla and a Sobe, it came to just over $9.00. While eating I was forced to think about the Mexican place I recently ate at in the Mission. This food was bland and almost tasteless, and very expensive, while the food server just a couple miles away was authentic, real, and not very expensive at all. It made me sad to think that things would be so watered down for the people ate at this place. What mostly made me sad was how much I paid for this crappy food. How lame...
I was telling Miss Macy about my idea that the Smurfs were communist propaganda and she told me to write it in my blog, so here it goes...  First off you have Papa smurf. He takes care of all the smurfs and coordinates the resources of the entire village. He also wears a RED hat, what a fucking commie. All of the smurfs have names that denote what they do in the village. Handy smurf, Heafty, Brainy (?), ect. They all do something, even if it's only just stand there and look good and no matter what they do they all get the same reward for their work. They all have the same house, the same food, and they all want to get some from smurfette but she aint givin' up to any of them. I don't know what that has to do with communism, but it still sucks all the same.  Now this brings us to Gargamel. This is where it gets deep. Gargamel is a capitalist that is always trying to make some cash by turning the smurfs into gold. Or to put it more simply, he wants to make money off of the hard working smurfs. If that doesn't scream bourgeois exploitation of the proletariat I don't know what does.   I don't know what the hell those two prince kids represented, but I'm sure it's something communist.
Heheheheheehehe    I AM....              You are 10% evil!    urlLink [How EVIIIIL are  you ?]      That's right!  You're the meekest of the meek!  You're the least amount evil!  The philosophy in ying and yang is that no one person can be completely good or completely evil, but you're pretty close to complete, goodie-two-shoes!
What does everyone think of the new 'Shpiel of the Week' column at the side?   Basically it's where I use a keyword, and spin a paragraph around it.  I got the idea from my friend  urlLink Jeff Yen  who picks a random word from a dictionary and writes a journal entry on it. I was his 'guest' entry for this particular word,Threat, which I've used as a starting point for my weekly shpiel.  What do you guys think?   Drop me a flooble yah?
Doli Incapax   and the 50-egg cake   I was at my friend  urlLink Joy's Blog   the other day, and read something interesting, called  doli incapax .  Basically it means that kids under the legal age of responsibility can't be held accountable for wrongful actions/ crime that they commit 'coz they can't yet tell right from wrong, and may not understand what they're doing.  Just what is the 'legal age of responsibility'? Hmm...maybe the argument can be used for certain *ahem* 22 year-olds?  I'd love to plead that case. Especially for me, the  bumbly butter-fingered buffoon .  Well, it was Shawn's 24th B'day party today, though his b'day's tomorrow (that's the surprise!), and I kept doing bumbly things. Like dropping Joy's camera (classic 3 stooges stuff), biting into my plastic fork, and worst, accidentally hitting E-Gene's still-recovering-from-ligament-operation knee. ARGF. After  I was so careful not to. (He was in pain - you should've seen his face.) Oh and did I forget to mention that I left the sandwich maker on and it burnt through it's own rubber insulated wiring? How one day can go so wrong I don't know...sigh...  And it's not just today. It's EVERYDAY. I'm constantly making a fool of myself, either putting my foot in my mouth or causing/being involved in accidents. Charles says I should just try to be more aware, but as you can see from the knee hitting incident, it makes no difference. I'm just bumbly lil' ol' me. Ah wells.....    Enough of my whinging and whining...   Shawn's party was pretty great, organised by his girlfriend Joy. We stuffed ourselves silly with party food like egg sandwiches, pasta and nachos. BURRRRP. And of course, later, the DENSEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER. It must have had 50 over eggs in it (I'm extrapolating that figure after considering the fact that a block of Peranakan kueh lapis has 30 eggs in it. I'm not kidding.) ACK...feeling the pain now...  I think the highlight of the party has to be the 'What do I hate/love about Shawn part' where everyone got to air their grievances. For more information, check out  urlLink his Blog  . Let's just say we had a ball of a time...hee hee hee...  Whatever it is, we all had a great time. Too bad Shawn did all the cooking and cleaning up after. :-) Now THAT'S what I call a good party, when the birthday boy prepares his own surprise birthday celebration. (No lah, he's not that pathetic...he was only let in on it 'coz there was no way to get him out of the way. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em! doodeedoodeedoo... His pasta was pretty good though.)     Bit of a borin' ol' read innit?     All rights, that's all for today. Sorry it's a bit of a boring read so far, only 'coz I'm too busy/lazy to write with my usual *ahem* creative flair. Tune in after I finish me essays for a more updated look to this site, and hopefully I'll be able to add more interesting links n stuff.
Oh man  Just checked out  urlLink  my sis' Blog  . Man that girl is crazy. Anyways, thing is, i followed the link to the 'Which Ep. 2 character are you?' website and found out my true calling is to be...bam bam bam bam....    urlLink    which Episode II character are you?      'Anakin Skywalker - jedi apprentice. Like Anakin, you know your morals and usually always stick to the rules. However, stray away from those who know best and you may become naiive to what anybody tells you. Stay with those whom you trust and have always been your friends. Otherwise, you may find yourself being manipulated by outside parties.'    Darnnit - i really wanted to be Obi-Wan Kenobi! ah wells...  Anyways, do me a favour and take the quiz then let me know which character you are! (In the flooble msg box at the side...)
Big Event    E-Gene had his knee operation today, to fix his torn ligament (soccer soccer soccer...the bane of all knees...)  Went with him in the morning, and checked into St Vincent's Private. Not bad - the room is pretty retro - the wallpaper, floor, TV etc. He has his own room and bathroom, so it's cool. The meals are pretty good - I know 'coz i ate his! (MMMM....yummy satay beef skewers on jasmine rice with peanut sauce, caesar salad, bread roll with butter, fruit salad, fizzy lemonade and clear consomme.) He wasn't allowed to eat anything coz of the anesthesia. He could have had something to eat in the morning, but coz we thought the Op was at 11 or 12, the time he checked in, so he didn't have anything to eat. In the end the Op was actually scheduled for 4pm.  Anyways, in the afternoon I left for the Apple store, came back but missed 'seeing him off' to the operating theatre. It was about 5pm, so I hung out at a cafe for the next couple hours, then went to wait in his room and watched TV there. He came back about 8.15-8.20 pm.   He came back looking woozy and tired - he was under General Anesthesia after all. He's now on a morphine drip 'coz he's allergic to other painkillers - and it's self-administered. Hmm...wonder if anyone ends up euthanising themselves by accident...  Anyways, thank God the operation went well. He seems fine, and will probably be out on Friday or Saturday. Check back for more details on this page!     Just a quick update on my iBook situation.    Yesterday I ran a check using Disk Doctor. It was pretty cool 'coz i used it via Wally's Disk Doctor, installed on his Powerbook, through FireWire. I couldn't start up the Disk Doc using the CD so had to use my iBook as FireWire disk, and scan my HD on Wally's Powerbook.  It was so cool! We connected the FireWire cable, pressed T as my iBook started up, and voila! My iBook's contents appeared on Wally's desktop! Woohoo Macs rule!  Anyways, went to the other Apple Centre today. The IT guy there was really nice. I explained what happened, and mention the *ahem* small knock it had.  Told him my dilemma of warranty running out, as well as the countless assignments due. He said no prob, he'll register my problem, so when I go see him again (when I can in a few weeks time after essays are done), the warranty would still cover it. Excellent! So now I have time to do my assignments, and also try reinstalling Word for OS X again to see if that could fix the problem.   (Am doing work on Word for OS 9 right now btw. For non-Maccers, with the new platform, my iBook has 2 operating systems - OS X and OS 9.2. Programmes on OS 9.2 can start up in OS X via Classic mode, which is what I'm doing now with Word. Capeesh?)  The IT guy was pretty cool. He's like one of those 'dude' IT guys lah - streaked blonde hair etc. And he kept saying 'no dramas' meaning 'no problem'. So now it's Charles' (who was also there to collect his new OS X software) and my catchphrase - No Dramas! haha...  Oh yes. Got a poster as well from the place. Pretty nice. It's the iMac - but the old one lah, not the new one. Am planning to pop by other Apple stores to see if they have other posters that are just stocking up...
It hasn't been a good day.  Firstly, I went to the Apple Store in town and they tell me the problem is probably the software, and the warranty doesn't cover software, only hardware. Then they tell me if I want them to check it out, it'll cost a $90 diagnostic fee, and then they'll give me a quote if I wanna repair the software. If it is a hardware problem, then it's covered under warranty. The whole process will take 3-4 days (or did she say it'll be 3-4 days b4 they get a LOOK at it? Which means it'll take at least 10 days altogether!)  I don't have Norton Utilities or Disk Doctor either. It could very well be a software problem that can be fixed by reinstalling my MS Word for OS X, or even reinstalling OS X itself. But i don't have the MS Office CD right now - it's with a friend.  Thing is, my warranty runs out in 6 days. So if i wanna get it fixed, i gotta do it quick. But i don't have the time to send it in 'coz i really need to finish researching and writing my essays! ARGH.  Basically I just want it done in the quickest way, less stress, NO $$$ spent. Everything costs so much in Australia!!  I'm gonna try another Apple Store near my place tomorrow, and see what they say. I'll call ahead though, and ask how much they charge for diagnostic fees etc. (The place i went to today didn't even take a look at my Mac!)   I think it's horribly unfair that they charge to tell you what's wrong with it. I can understand charging to fix the problem, but not for taking a look at it! Previously they had fixed a problem I had with the iBook on the spot (it wouldn't start up). Today they weren't even helpful! I don't get it.  Sigh...why don't I ever learn?
AAARRRGGGHHHHHHHHGGGGHHHHHH        I dropped my iBook. My precious precious iBook. On the ground. From a chair. I knocked it over. By accident. Honest.    Ack! Now my Microsoft Word application won't open, and certain folders in the Finder can't be opened either.    And I have 3 MAJOR essays due soon.    HELP!! I'm almost in tears. This is terrible. And I really wanted to finish an essay by today so I could start on the rest. But I guess it's not meant to be. The scary thing is, I think I may have to send it into the Apple Store and get it fixed, and they might wanna change the hard drive or something. Which means I'll have to backup all my applications etc. and I don't have a CD writer or anything (although I could back it up on iDisk on the Apple servers, but that'll take too long on my 56k modem). I think hopefully my *AHEM* good buddy Charles (nudge nudge) might lend me his external CD-writer so I can back up my stuff.       WHY MUST THIS HAPPEN NOW??      I'm sure there must be a reason for all this to happen, some sort of Big Master Plan or something.  Either that or I should just be less  lun-zun .   Personally, I think it's the latter. Not that I don't believe in a BMP, just that I'm always  lun-zun  ;-)  Charles and E-Gene tell me that all the time. Like how if I could just be more aware, and watch what I'm doing I could avoid lotsa accidents.   But the point is, it's not like I'm not trying or anything. When you're unconsciously unaware, you just ARE. It's not like you can really help it.   Or Can You??    I don't know. I really don't know.   As a famous man once said,      So Help Me God!!
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!  I can't seem to see my flooble on my Mac. WHY??  My page views fine on PCs...just not on my iBook.     BOO HOOOOOO
I have given up   Given up on writing my essay   So I just had KFC for dinner    I'm gonna watch a DVD now      WoopeeDOO!!      -----------------------------------------------------------    As you can tell I'm learning and testing HTML as i go along. Crazy isn't it. Picking up bits n pieces along the way. But I'm still pretty new at it. That's why it's an obsession now, to tweak my Blog. ARGH...
Oh my goodness. I've spent the WHOLE day bumming around. Haven't written much! only about 78 outta 2000 wds! ARGH!!!  what's wrong with me?    i should really get off the net and get cracking...
I'm supposed to be doing my essay now but am obsessed with fiddling with my Blog's appearance. Picking up a lil' HTML along the way - never done so b4. Am not a techie.  The only prob is i can't seem to change the colours on the side bar for shawn, e-gene and bart's links to orange like charles' n tessa's. And i can't seem to see the 'flooble chatterbox' (a forum thingy) anywhere on the page - i think coz i use a mac and haven't updated my javascript capability or something...  I'd also like to enable a comments link to my posts. Anyone has any idea how to do so?  Btw, g0ldfi5h.blogspot.com is no longer in use - although the page still exists lah - the archives. It's herefishyfishy now. Although the ones i wanted, like goldfish.blogspot or fishbowl.blogspot were already taken. Darnnit
urlLink    Went to the Hoyts Cinemas website and saw a contest they had for Spiderman - winner gets an original signed poster. So i entered the contest - the question was 'If you could be a super hero, what kind would you be and why?'  I wrote:      I wanna be  Super-Essay-Girl  ! To save the world of Uni Students from the drudgery of writing essays on post-modernism and psychoanalytic theory! With my acto-plasmo eyeglasses I'd scan all textbooks and regurgitate information into 16-pg Times font size 12 scripts!      Cool huh? Hehe wish she'd really exist so she'd handle my essays for me haha...
All rites...  Well then, things are starting to heat up for me now..lotsa essays and stuff. Feeling the pressure a bit..sigh. Not sure what to do. Plus i have to struggle with the various assignments, and i keep procrastinating.   I think that's (one of) my biggest faults...  Anyways, am eating butter and sugar on bread right now - the poor man's brekky hehe. But it really doesn't taste fantastic on sourdough bread. My advice is, stick to plain ol' white 'lo-ti'.  I got my radio assignment back today. Had overslept and missed class this morning - the second time this week! I was royally pissed that it happened - really wanted to make the class and discuss/workshop my ideas with people 'coz i was  feeling a little lost. Was so upset. Ack. Anyways saw my tutor just before her next class and got back my radio assignment, which i did pretty ok in.  My good buddy Charles got his back too - and i'm pretty upset on his behalf. I read his piece a little before he handed it in, and i really don't think it deserved a P. At the very very least an H3 (the grading system in Melbourne Uni is H1, then H2A, H2B, H3, Pass, Fail). And according to him she sorta 'dissed' his idea for the feature story too.  He wanted to write on Palms - or rather Personal Digital Assistants. Can you believe that she hasn't heard of them? Then again, I'm not surprised...apparently Australia is about 5 years behind in the whole PDA world - like their AUSPUG (Australian Palm Users Group) was just set up recently (as compared to the thriving one in S'pore and the States which have been around for ages). Geez Louiz...  Oh wells, so much for that. He's gonna try to reangle his story, and pitch it again. Hope she takes the bait!  As for me, I'm planning to do my topic on Naturopathy. Like natural healing and all. But i think the story's been done before, so I'm trying to take a fresh approach. I thought of pursuing the angle of people studying naturopathy and why they choose to do so etc., but i realise that it's too narrow for a 2500-wd piece. The most i can squeeze outta this angle is about 1500 wds? And that's the max. So what to do then? (Any ideas, please let me know). I'll prob. see her again on Monday to discuss.  All ritey then. I'm gonna sleep now. Even though i don't really feel sleepy - slept from about 6-10pm just now! eeks..screwing up my whole system. But I'm supposed to wake up early and go for Brekky at this place called Fruits of Passion. It's got really good brekky, but a lil' expensive. Ah wells...pancakes yay!  Nitey nite! TTFN (Ta Ta For Now!)
Bras 'n Things    Woohoo...went shopping again today. Myers is having a sale, today and tomorrow only, so i ended spending $88 on lingerie!! But i bought like 7 items, so that was pretty worth it (usually 80 bucks only gets you about 2 bras and 1 underwear...).  So yes, am pretty happy. Going crazy shopping i know. I spent 2 hrs there, SOLELY in the lingerie section, while poor Charles had to wander around the department store alone...poor guy.  But all this spending really means i have to get down n search for a job. Eeeks..praying for a good and fun one.  Anyways, we had a nice night after all that shopping...came back to Homebush (my old apt. where Wally, E-Gene and Shawn still reside) and cooked dinner, then had our Monday TV night. Yay, nothing like good food and good company (friends and the telly heehee).  Tomorrow my friend Joanne's supposed to arrive from Canberra for a visit. That should be fun! I'm also supposed to watch 'I am Sam' tomorrow as well, can't wait.  By the way, everyone's vacating Homebush on July 7. Wally's moving to stay with a church friend, Shawn's moving to Jon's place (and therefore becoming my neighbour!), while E-Gene may or may not be returning to S'pore for good. I feel sad..it's like an end of an era or something. Had good times here, plus both Michelle's and Kenneth's places are in North Melbourne. Sigh...Wells, we're having a going away party on Thursday, have the whole gang over to bid this place a fond farewell.   Getting late, better sleep now.  Nites
It's been awhile...    Yep, i'm back to blogging again...it's been quiet, mostly 'coz i've been tied up with assignments n essays n stuff. But it's the hols now, at least till 29 July!  Been having fun since stuff ended on the 14th. Went skiing at Mt. Buller with E-Gene's family, and that was really fun. His whole family was there, including his sis and bro-in-law and nephew. Boy, the baby's cute! His name's Ethan, and if i knew how to upload a pic onto my blog i would, but sadly...need to find erm, some server or something b4 i can upload pics right? (Hmm... i think i can put it up on my mac site...will check that out.)  Anyways, skiing was really fun, had a ball of a time just tumbling down the slopes hehe....would have loved to ski more, or at least try a longer distance, but it wouldn't have been much fun without E-Gene around...he couldn't ski 'coz he didn't want to risk injuring his knee again.  Watched the England-Brazil match at a pub yesterdat afternoon (the telecast here was at 4.30pm). The crowd was a good mix of Brazilian and English fans, so there was an equal amount of cheering going on. We had originally intended to go down to a pub in the city, but my friend who got there first said it was so packed they were turning people away. So we went to a place on the outskirts of the city instead.   The match was pretty exciting. Let it be known, I'm not exactly a huge crazed fan of soccer, but i do enjoy watching the game now and then, especially between good teams. But i think i still prefer watching it by myself, or with a smaller group of people. I guess when you don't share as much passion about the team as the VB-drinking bloke next to you, it's hard to cheer the team on (and in the process slosh beer on your clothes).   But there were these calm collected group of girls at the next table too, watching the game, having chips and wedges and the occasional Lemon Ruski. They looked as out of place as I did, me with my calm claps, plastic smile, and feeling torn between rooting for England (which my friends were, and i'm 'supposed' to by default as E-Gene is a Liverpool fan...), and Brazil which i kinda liked for their playing skills. Plus Brazil seemed like the underdogs in the beginning after Owen's goal. (AND!! Ashley Cole wasn't too friendly to Ronaldinho who'd placed his hand on the former's shoulder as a friendly gesture, or what i perceived as a friendly gesture at least, only to have Cole shove his arm away. Plus Cole was equally rude to other players later on.   erm, if anyone disagrees, drop a flooble and we can discuss the finer points of soccer etiquette  Which was why my heart kinda tugged towards the Brazilian players after a while...)  Well, two Bacardi Breezers and many contraband hot peanuts (we bought some from the Asian grocer and snuck them in) later, Brazil's in the semi's for the World Cup. No surprises there i guess, although it would've been nice to see England in the semis after all this time...    Wow...i actually sound like i know my soccer stuff huh? Amazing...    Oh wells, anyways, it being the hols and all, i'm trying to find a job now. Either at a cafe or as a sandwich hand or something. Both seem pretty fun to me... :-) Less boring than an office job. But i need a good environment (pple and boss must be nice), good flexible hours (so i can still enjoy the hols, and spend time with my sis when she comes over), and good pay (not too worried about that, pay here is pretty decent, from $10-15 at least, depending on the job). So praying for opportunities...  All rights, almost 1am now, am planning to go to church tomorrow (after a looooong hiatus...bad huh?) so gotta go sleep! Nites!  Okies, it's late. Will write more (hopefully) tomorrow.  Drop me a flooble yah?
Something Wrong with Blogger?    Is somthing wrong? 'Coz I've fiddled around with the blog, but it seems kooky. Like I actually added a counter, but it keeps disappearing. And I also added some new links and that disappeared everytime I refreshed the template menu (in the Edit Blog mode of Blogger) too.  What's happening?  Hmmm...something FISHY's going on around here in my goldfish bowl...
FINISHED 2 essays    The major ones at least.  Phew!  Now only 2 to go..  I've actually done the Intercultural one, the Monsoon Wedding Review. Now it's just a matter of completing the Feminist Film one. Phew.
Freedom of Speech?    I chanced upon this Blog, as how web surfing usually goes, by clicking link to link to link.  It's a page about this lady in the States, who     got  urlLink fired   for what she wrote on her Blog.     What's the state of freedom of speech now? Internet laws are still in their infancy stage - can she sue them for firing her? (Joy? Any comments?)  It makes me wonder, could I get into trouble for what I'm posting right now? If that's the case, my Blog'll never be able to fully express what I think or feel 'coz *gulp* Big Brother's watching...it's Self-Censorship at work...  This sucks doesn't it?  Anyways, I read  urlLink  what she wrote  about her boss and co-workers. It seemed innocent enough, a standard rage-against-the-machine rant.   IMHO, some people are just wayyyyyyyy too sensitive. I mean c'mon, it's not like the whole world gets along right? We all need room to express our pent-up pissed-offness...  The sad thing is, I think the machine won.  urlLink  dooce.com   has been abandoned, although you can still read the  urlLink archives . And this all happened in the good ol' US of A, where the the  urlLink  1st Amendment   clearly states     'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'  The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution    Of course, this means that the   government   can't interfere. But it seems like nosy co-workers can. hmmm....  Oh wells. No big deal right? Singaporeans have always practiced self-censorship right?    But at what price?   Drop me a flooble yah?
What in the world??    Hmm... i took this test today, off  urlLink  my sis'   blog. Check this out...I'm a   urlLink       Take the  urlLink What High School Stereotype Are You?  quiz, by  urlLink Angel .  Now that's a weird result. 'Coz I've never thought myself as particularly athletic or er...dumb. Then again, if the bumbly butter-fingered buffoon strikes again...(read the 30/5 Blog (' Doli Incapax  and the 50-egg cake') to find out what happened in a previous episode...)  Ah wells.   And yes Tess, I've gone Jewish.   Ya talk sommor and I shvitz ya in ya tuckas ya hear? (That's my yiddish-Queens accent, courtesy of  urlLink The Nanny  )  You know, I actually remember the lyrics for the entire theme song to the show...erm, minus a few gaps of course...      She was selling some make-up in Flushing, Queens  When her boyfriend kicked her out in one of those crushing scenes. What was she to do, where was she to go She was out on her fanny....         So she ?? over to the Sheffield's door She was selling some make-up, the father saw more She had style, she had flair, she was there That's how she became the Nanny...         Who would have thought that this girl we described Would just exactly be what the doctor prescribed          Now the father found her beguiling (watch out C.C.!) And the kids were actually smiling (such a smile indeed) She is the lady in red, while everyone else is in bed...(??) The flashy girl from Flushing, the nanny named Fran!      urlLink  Hear the song in MIDI    urlLink  Actual lyrics    Well, that's  how I remember it. How sad is that? Maybe I am a pea-brianed jock after all...(oh man, i just found out  urlLink  my boyfriend   is a jock too after taking the test! ack, how weird is that?! Two peas in a jock pod...)  Okies, back to my essays. See ya sooon! (Hmm, I suddenly have the urge to pee...flushing...flushing...)
We interrupt our regularly scheduled programme to bring you this groundbreaking news story!    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- This morning at 2.30 am, Miss Sarah Wong, a 22 year-old woman, was admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after having an allergic reaction to the anti-flatulence medicine, Mylanta.  The allergy symptom is described as a 'red rash covering the length of the patient's body, with small bumps appearing on her arms and a little on her face and neck.' The patient also suffered from puffy eyes, and a cough resulting from the constriction of her wind-pipes, making it hard for her to breathe.   According to the woman, described by night-shift nurses at the triage station as a 'walking asthmatic lobster with bumps', she had overate during dinner, and thus felt its residual effects - a little heartburn, and 'wind' in the stomach. She then decided to take Mylanta to help ease her discomfort.  Unfortunately, 10 minutes after ingesting the medicine, she felt flushed, and experienced an itching sensation all over her body, which gradually turned into a bumpy rash on her arms and neck. This was when she decided to call her boyfriend who drove her to a nearby hospital to receive treatment.  According to Miss Wong, 'My throat felt tight - probably from the allergy as well, which was why I thought it might be serious. I mean, I've never been allergic to anything in my life before, so I was quite worried.'  After a thorough examination by the doctor, it was pronounced that the Mylanta medicine was probably the cause of the reaction, and not, as suspected, the garlic prawns she had consumed for dinner earlier that night.  'I've had Mylanta once before, but didn't have a reaction then, though I was probably still allergic to it. Apparently the first time I took it, my body was just sensitised to it, which explains why I didn't get a rash then. But this time round, my body just reacted against it.'  After a dose of antehestamines (injected into her system via a drip - a painful first-time experience as well), and a few hours of sleep under observation, the symptoms receded and the patient was free to go home, with instructions to visit the allergy clinic the following week.  'I'm quite thankful that nothing more serious had happened - I hear you can actually die from allergic reactions! Praise God I'm fine now! I'll probably be more careful with what I consume from now on, and will make a habit of reading the labels in detail, checking the ingredients list. I mean what if I end up turning into a yellow banana with fairy wings the next time round? What happens then?'  30 July 2002 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We now return you to our regulary scheduled programme...
Chest Pains Part Deaux     Why do I seem to always hurt the ones I love the most?  Why do I lash out?  Sometimes I just wish that they'd disappear. Even when I don't want them to. Or maybe I do.  Sometimes I just want to  yell  and  scream  and  shout  at people. To just fully release!  But I can't. I'm trapped. I worry about consequences and their feelings and remorse that I know I'll feel at the end.  I wish they wouldn't take it personally if I really did that. Even if it really is personal.  If I could have said something just now, I would have said :  Actually I don't know what I would have said.  My heart's beating way too fast for its own good now. It hurts. Can't breathe. Heartburn? Need a doctor. Literally....it hurts to have the blood and vessels pump at such a rate. Ouch. Too quick. Ouch...
Chest Pains     My heart is thumping really quickly now. Ba-dam-ba-dam-ba-dam. Ouch.   Way too quickly for any good. Heartburn?  Must be the garlic prawns.
Today...   I miss my sister terribly - it just seems strange not to have her hanging around, irritating me (just joking...). Even though it was only for a week, she really made her presence felt, and I mean that in a good way. Just doing the scrapbook for our trtip to Tasmania brings fond memories of a time past recently - last week in fact.  Maybe it's just the thought that I won't see her for quite a while - with her going to Bristol in Sept/Oct and all. She represented, on a deeper level, a link to my family back home. Oh how I miss them all.  Tomorrow is the start of a new term. How did the holidays fly by so quickly? I can honestly say it has been an eventful break, what with all the travelling I've done, and the things I've seen. Still no luck with the job hunt though. Favour Lord, Favour!!  There's still so much to do and see. This semester promises to be a challenging one, with me taking two Film subjects (equating to two 3000 word essays in the middle of the semester! ), hopefully holding fort with a job, and I haven't gotten round to taking those driving lessons I've been saving up for (and which money I have technically spent already on ordinary expenses...). I'm also planning to help out with the Children's Ministry in church, and am also taking an Alpha course, which is sorta a foundation studies thing  - good 'coz it's like going back to the basics of the Bible. Wow - so many things to accomplish - grace needed here!  Well, Shawn's back, which means I see even less of EG 'coz his comp. and best bud are both at Jon's place (Shawn's Jon's new roomie). Woopadeedoo... Everyone always kids that the 2 of 'em are like lovers! (erm, EG and Shawn, not EG and his comp., although now that I think about it, the PC always seems to hum a little when EG's around...) Anyways, the point is, in this little love triangle, I'm the 'concubine' you see. Unless you go by EG's version, which is that I'm the 'wife', the one he's married to, while Shawn's the 'mistress', the one who he really wants to be with. Haha...whatever...  No lah, it's good that he hangs out with his buddy - gives me a lil' space, a lil' of my time you know? So however much I whine that I'll never see as much of EG now that Shawn's back, I'm pretty ok about it, plus I'm glad Shawnie's back too. Miss his sudden rants about society's faults and the various places in Melbourne which are 'a bloody rip-off!!'  Welcome back Shawn.
Yet another one    Yep, this confirms it. I'm a womyyyyyn!! No need for no man! Grrrrrl Power!!     urlLink

Chaddy and Dandenongnongnenong   I had a truly wonderful time today. Woke up, went shopping in Chadstone Shopping Mall with my sis, and then drove to Mt. Dandenong where I had terrific devonshire scones, the hugest sundae you've ever seen, and lovely asparagus, chicken and cheese fingers, accompanied by Taylor's tea. Yummm....  Not by myself of course - with E-Gene, Tess and Charles.  Later, it was time spent wondering around looking at nice tea shops and bought essential oils and an oil burner, which unfortunately i cracked much later that night. (No fear, it's still usable - one of those internal cracks caused by sudden change in temperatures when i ran some water over the hot dish).  Added to the depletion in my wallet's funds was the $$ spent on a nice new 3-for-the-price-of-2 book at Border's, which turned out to have a 20% discount for Uni students today. (Charles and EG returned at night to make more purchases).  And that was my day.   Tomorrow should be fun as well - prepping for a b'day party for my sis, who turns 19, and who'll be insisting on wearing the pretty fairy wings she bought today. It'll be a medium-small affair - about 10 pple for a potluck dinner. Little cocktail sausage  hors d'ouevers  anyone?  But tomorrow also marks the 2nd last day I'll see my sis for a really long while. She'll be in Bristol from September/October onwards, for the next 3 years. But she'll be back at least once a year, so that'll be good. Am planning to visit her in Bristol one day, so we can get a Euro Rail pass and travel round Europle. Excitement!  Having Tessa around made me realise a lotta things about myself somehow. In many ways we're so much alike, bumbling, making mistakes as we find our way through life, and it's hard when I realise stuff she does that irritate me probably irritate others when I do it too. Ack. Plus I also seem to nag a lot at her hehe...(which incidentally is very much the same way EG used to nag at me). As she puts it, I tend to treat her like a living doll, often mothering, (even smothering?) her. I guess 'coz I'm too used to being the older sis.  Am trying to let go I guess.   One thing's for sure though, I'm definitely going to be bawling when she leaves on Friday. I can imagine it now, me blubbering away at the airport. Eeek. Really for all the stuff that irritates me when she's here, like not having my own space, small quibbles about inane stuff, I really love having my sister around. Especially 'coz we both share the same warped sense of humour (we're the only 2 idiots who laugh at each other's half-assed jokes, which would usually elicit a loud groan and shake of the head from other people). Underneath certain differences, we   get   each other. Plus it's also cool when we can trick other people over the phone 'coz we both sound the same. Muahahahah....  Ah well, mushy eh? Ahhh, I can still recall the times when we'd fight and scratch and pull each other's hair. Woohooo...  Time to sleep.My bed awaits.
Conversations with my sis    Tess: Namu? Me: er..namu? Tess: Namunamunamu! Me: You have namu-itis... Tess (shock, horror): Namu is NOT a disease! It's a way of life!!   (Note to readers: I still have absolutely no idea what Namu is. A term purportedly invented by my sis, it still dares to do the unthinkable and defy definition. One up for the think-out-of-the-box-ers) .
Tess and Tas    In the last few weeks I can safely say I was never for a moment bored.  Spent last Wed to Sun morning in Tasmania, with Charles, E-Gene and my sis Tessa. It was a fantastic getaway, seeing the sights, and generally spending a wonderful time with my sis. Really enjoyed it (I should put up some photos...)  School's starting next week though, which is kinda a drag - where did all the good times go? Plus I'm still on the hunt for a job, which I can't seem to get unless I confirm my timetable. Well, we'll see what happens. This semester promises to be pretty exhausting.  On another note, Mac is gonna start charging me to use the email account and all the other nifty features it has, like iDisk and Homepage. I don't use much of it I guess - mostly just the email account, which is forwarded from my school account anyways. It's just 'coz there's the benefit of having a POP or IMAP account, which means I can d/l me mails. Darn, really dun wanna pay the $$ for it - it's US$99.95 a year, but I get a discount for the first year, so it's $49.95. But it's STILL in US dollars...ack....  Going to Chadstone ('the largest shopping mall in the Southern Hemisphere') and Mt. Dandenong tomorrow. Excited about Ms Marples...this cool English tea place that features, u guessed it, Agatha Christie's Ms Marples character, as it's central character.  Am trying to revamp my blog somewhat  - add in cool stuff, like piccies and I dunno, interesting stuff I guess. Good that Tess is around, so she can help me.   I woke up today with the intention of arriving at 9am in school to help the newbies with enrolment. Guess what time I arrived? 10.45am. Woohoo, that has gotta be a record. In the end, they didn't really need much help, so i just mooshed around, chatting, gossiping, discussing last night's SATC and Buffy episodes (btw, the 2 ep. finale was on tonight - Willow vs Buffy...wooo...scary...to the uninformed, Tara, Willow's gf got shot accidentally and Willow's on this kill-the-world-so-I-feel-better-but-end-up-hurting-myself-and-the-people-I-love rampage. Woah nelly...)  Not that I'm really a fan actually. I just watch it once in awhile when I happen to flip the channel. Demons and witches, pardon me for my lack of liberal-minded thinking, still pretty much freak me out. They might seem harmless on TV, with their wisecracks and all, but that's what the Devil wants you to think doesn't he? Hmmm...  Anyways, time to sleep. Wondering if I should bother to sign up for the Melbourne Blog Meetup or not. Hmm...    Ciao bella!
The Name Game    I like the name Aidan (Ay-dun). Guess it must be all that   Sex and the City   that I've been watching. I dunno. It just has a nice ring to it doesn't it?  I also like the name Arian, or Arienne, or whatever spelling permutations there are. Pronounced  Ari-ahn  . Or maybe   Ari-ann  .  Nice name for kids don't you think? I can imagine yelling at them to tell 'em dinner's ready. AHHH RIIIIII!!! or DANNY!! Sounds nice eh?  Although I also would like calling my kid by his/her initials too, which is why a middle name is needed. Like CJ or AJ or KC or something. hehe... i once thought of calling my daughter Caitlin Josephine just so i could shorten it to CJ.  E-Gene, sadly, thought naming his kid Aidan Samuel Soh would've been a laugh (yeah we both like the name Aidan. Whoever gets a boy first gets that name! dammit...tick tock tick tock...). Can you imagine the teasing and bullying the poor child would face in the playground? Who wants his kid's initals to be ASS??!! Wah lau eh...damn cruel...  Ah wells, who gets the male mind eh?
It's one of those days    It's one of those $&^$(*&^& days when you just hate everything and everyone and everything around you. Everything.  I don't understand why I'm so edgy. I just am.  And it's annoying that it just comes out in tight-lipped strained tones when I speak. I apologise to anyone who had to cross my path today.  I hate that i can't express myself properly, fully, and without whining. As one of my good friends Michelle says, 'Sarah and whining just go together, but we accept it i suppose. It's part of you.'  Sigh.  Sometimes i just wanna lash out and yell words that would make a hard-core sailor blush.
Drew drew a picture of drool...   Yeppers, this week is Drew Barrymore week. With highlights on TV Wed and Sat (Best Men and Home Fries), plus me n EG are watching Riding in Cars with Boys tonight. Yay...  My friend Elaine is flying off tomorrow morning to see her bf in San Fran. He's a sailor she met at the WTC in Singapore. Quite exciting really. I hope she takes lots of pictures!  Anyways, gtg watch RICWB now. Seeya!
Coffee, Tea or Me?    Thaaaaaaat's right. I'm becomin' a *ahem* barista, or in more colloquail terms,  ka-fei mei . Yep, just applied at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf round the corner from my place, and hopefully will get a job there, serving people their cappucinos and cafe lattes. Yay...can't wait.  No seriously. I can't wait. Need money to supplement my expensive habits like shopping, eating and taking public transport. You'd be amazed at how much I spend a week. Not to mention groceries, rent and phone bills.  But being a  ka-fei mei  isn't too bad an idea. I don't really mind it actually, mostly 'coz the hours are flexible, you get to interact with people and you aren't stuck behind a desk and computer. It's fun actually, which is why I'm pretty excited about it, IF I get the job.  The funny thing about Melbourne is, to get any job, you've gotta have a resume. EVEN for part-time work at coffee joints. Strange huh? Back home they just make you fill up a form, and if you look pleasant enough, speak good english, and can tell the difference between a mocha ice-blended and a mocha caramel ice-blended (it's the caramel,  duuhhh ), you're a shoo-in for the job.  Here, they get you to fill in a form, and a resume with REFERENCES mind you, people they can call to vouch for you, just in case you're a schizophrenic psychopath about to suddenly attack customers with scalding hot Special Dutch Chocolate. Can you just imagine that?  Sttstttsttt....must get foam just right, stttststttt, just right, caramel mocha, mocha...waitaminit. Did she just give me FIVE CENTS LESS?   Hey lady, you're five cents SHORT. It's four ninety-FIVE lady, FIVER at the end lady, heard that? Says so on the screen! FIVE CENTS LADY! FIVE CENTS GEDDIT? FIIIIIVVVEEE CENTS!! FIIIIIVVVVVEE WHOLE CENTS!!!! What, you don't know how to count huh? AHHHHHHHHH!!!   and I suddenly launch at the poor unsuspecting woman desperately trying to dig out the coin from her purse with trembling fingers, screaming like a banshee, spilling caramel and creamy milk everywhere, a bulbous vein throbbing at my temple.   Phew!    Erm, in case my future employers are somehow reading this, I'm NOT REALLY INSANE. I've NEVER been institutionalised at a mental hospital before (unless you count my secondary school years...)   Thank you. Just needed to clear that up.  Well, the job's all in God's hands. Praying for it, and going by faith. I really want a job that has a good working environment, good colleagues and boss, good flexible hours, and good pay (it's pretty standard pay here - The Bean'll prob. pay me about $10-12 an hour, a rate I'll never get back in S'pore!). Hours-wise, i wrote on my application form that i'd prefer the morning 7am-12pm slots Tues to Fridays (although negotiable), simply 'coz that frees up the rest of the day, and my sis is coming to visit. And i don't really have to wake up that early 'coz i live pretty near. So praying! They'll probably call me soon to arrange an interview. I'll sell the fact that I can spell most people's names, an asset when writing them down on the plastic ice-blended cups. (can you imagine? The Bean at Junction 8 Bishan spelt my name as Sey-la! Wah lau eh....)  Okies. gtg now. Nite nite.  Drop me a flooble yah?
Daisies and Daffodils     Oh yesterday was wonderful. Helped out with Daffodil Day, which is basically a day the Cancer Council of Victoria has to raise funds for Cancer Research.  It was really fun - woke up at 6 plus am (can u believe it??!! And I'm NOT a morning person...), went down to Flinder's St. Station and sold all sorts of Daffodil-type merchandise, including pins, ribbons, pens, a cute teddy bear (which was dressed for summer complete with thongs on his paws), a footy ball and bunches of real daffodils! I got to wear this Daffodil Day t-shirt, which I even managed to keep (though I really wanted to keep this yellow pouch we used to collect money in, but couldn't. Shucks....)  So there we were, a bunch of girls at a table outside the station, selling stuff. 3 of us decided to wander down a lil' further, outside Maccers on Swanston St., and managed to sell quite a bit too. We even got our picture taken by this passing photog.  All in all, a really fun start for yesterday. I'd definitely do it again, esp. since it was for a good cause (or as Ew Lee puts it, 'buy a daffodil, support a chawitab...a chawribaba...a cha.. ah-fegget-it, it's for Cancer Research!!') and people do make an effort and come up and support the cause. Best of all,   hello , yellow is   so  my  colour !
The Big Issue   I saw him at Flinder's Street Station today. Got off the tram and bought a copy.  At least I think it was him. He sounded different. Maybe he was just another gruff old man.  I hope it was him.
ARGH 2    ARGHHHHHHH. No TIME to look for one either...
ARGH    ARGHHHHHH. No job......
Why?   I don't have a regular job any longer. They told me yesterday, after my shift, that they were implementing a change in the schedule or something, and would call me as and when they needed me. So now it's a casual basis kinda thing. They were pretty vague about a reason why this had to happen, and I was still under shock so I didn't press for details. I figured maybe 'coz they had 2 new pple, this Shanghainese woman and man, who seemed like new partners or soemthing. Ah dunno lah.  I honestly think it's a cheap way of firing someone and letting them down nicely, YET keeping them hanging on your lil' pinky finger so you can depend on a filler when you need someone.  This REALLY sucks. I mean, what the? After 2 weeks of training etc. And I really think I did pretty ok, and got along with everyone. If it was just a trial, tell me it was a trial. I shifted my classes around so I could fit the job in. Now they do this. I have a bleedin' 4 hour break on Wednesdays for goodness sake!  I'd better cancel the scheduled transfer that's supposed to move $$ every week from my bank account to a savings maximiser one. Was planning to put aside $$ each week, earn interest, and have $$ at the end of the semester to fly back home for hols. Now  that  idea's shot.  Happened to my friend, who was working the Mon & Thurs shift too.  This really stinks.  On the upside, at least I'm using the time to get some research done. ONLY 4 weeks left. Haven't done much. Arrrghhhhh.  Stomach hurts now. Gastric and wind. Am not daring to try Mylanta again. Tried 3 other forms of medication though, to no effect. Sigh.  Only looking forward to the presentation for TV Cultures we've been working at. We're gonna majorly impress the pple, and whoop everyone's ass! As Michalengelo (of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) would say,   Cowabunga Duuude!
Regret   Ever had one of those moments where you coulda shoulda woulda done something if you weren't frozen by nervousness or inertia? One of those moments where you miss an opportunity and it  never really quite comes round again?  Today one of the vendors for The Big Issue came up the tram. He was a well-built old man, his face tan and leathery, his hair silver, and each of the many wrinkles on his gruff visage told of the things he had seen and done. He stood tall, proud, save for a scruffy grey sweater that had seen better days, and a Big Issue vest and sling bag, both worn at the edges.  He sat on the seat in front of me, facing the lady on my left. I stole a quick peek at the cover - a smiling Rachel Griffiths next to a headline for Six Feet Under. I averted my eyes - I didn't feel like buying a copy. True, the money went to a good cause - the magazine employed the homeless to raise funds for the homeless, helping them get back on their feet. But except for the 5 copies I bought last year, when the idea of giving back to society in such a convenient way was still a novel idea, I hadn't approached a vendor to buy one since; I didn't have time to read anyway.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan, young lady?' said the old man to a pony-tailed woman who'd just come up the tram. She just smiled and shook her head.  'You know why I'm asking don't you? he pressed on, the magazine in his hand, a wry smile on his lips. She smiled and nodded, then turned away. 'Yeah, not much of a fan myself, just like the photographs,' he said, smiling to himself, as he twisted the magazine in his hand.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the bespectacled teenage boy that came up next. 'No,' he replied simply.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the lady sitting across the aisle. She shook her head, too absorbed in her own thoughts.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the lady next to me. I looked down at my shoes, then stared straight ahead. He didn't bother asking me.  He got off the tram at the next stop. My heart was pounding, my head was screaming. I should have done something. I could have bought a copy. He'd just fallen on tough times. He could be someone's father, someone's grandfather. He could have saved lives. I could have invited him back for a cuppa, we could have talked. We would both have made a new friend.  I looked out the window, and saw him cross the road to Flinders Street Station. He stood outside in the cold, wrapped in his grey sweater, holding The Big Issue, smoking a cigarette.  The tram moved off. I opened my bag, and saw my wallet. I took it out, looked through, saw that I had a ten-dollar bill, and a five-dollar one.   I could have bought a copy. But I didn't. I was afraid. I was ashamed.   19 August 2002
It's been awhile...    Yep, sorry haven't been on for awhile, mostly coz v.v. bz with school and all. Subjects this sem are  TV Cultures  (expert on this!!),  MarComm  (although unlike the one i took in Mass Comm...more theoretical),  Italian National Cinema   (must read up on fascism etc etc..), and   Contemporary Hollywood Cinema   (can someone PLEASE explain '2001: A Space Odyssey' to me please??!!)  Special Mention Alert: Welcome PRIYANCA!! Yes, this is my blog....however, if you are reading this right now,   get back to work!!  . Tsk tsk... I wonder what AWARE would think of their brightest young talent if they found out she was spending time reading people's blogs instead of doing her job... tsktsk...hehehe  Am v.v. tired nowadays, mostly 'coz of the early starts. Am NOT a morning person, and I hate having 9 am classes. eep....skipped a couple already. And I have another tomorrow!  The  job so far is pretty cool.  Getting to know the people at work a lil' better, and Jah-mes seems to be loosening up. He's actually a pretty nice guy. :-)   I guess one of the perks of the job are the free coffee and food. I mean the last place I worked at was so anal about making money it charged its employees if they wanted to eat the food there! While they were working! I mean I can understand if any day you just happened to pop by and ordered something, you'd have to pay, but I mean come on, if you've been working there 4 hours in a row and there's no lunch break and if you wanna grab something to munch on while there weren't customers, you still have to pay?? So much for employee benefits.   Phew   I hoped all that made sense.  Whatever it is, I like how the job's going so far. Have decided to take one of the church aunties' advice and put aside a lil' each week (after tithing of course) as part of a savings plan. There's this fund/investment management firm where I can transfer $$ from my bank account, earn interest through them, and transfer the $$ back anytime I want. It's pretty good, and the current rate is 4.75% on yr principal, calculated   daily  , with no other charges, and no minimal principal amount. Sounds pretty good eh? Hopefully can save enough to go for a lil' holiday back home to S'pore at the end of the year. :-)  Okies, enough for now. Here are some things I MUST do, and soon...  1. Stop munching on those addictive Arnott's Mint Slices  2. Reduce chockie intake - just now the house (that's Evelyn, Me, EG, Shawn, Chris, and Jon who wasn't around 'coz he was out) took a stock take and realised that ALL my snacks had choc. content, even the healthy muesli bars...sigh  3. Start exercising - which may be hard 'coz I can't make the Taibox classes this sem, and my ankle's acting up. Btw, haven't even started using my new running gear!! eek...   Oh yes, on this note, just caught a really freaky episode of Smallville, this Clark Kent-in-highschool drama. A pretty-but-plump (aren't we all?) girl was desperate to lose weight so she started drinking veggie shakes made out of veggies found in her garden. Thing is, some meteors from Krypton had landed there when Clark aka Superman landed on Earth, and so the veggies were genetically altered somehow. Everytime she drank them, her fat content reduced dramatically (liposuction w/o the tubes), so she became slim pretty fast! Woohoo...BUT after awhile she started getting really hungry, and the only way she could successfully stave off the hunger was by consuming another being's fat - like a deer, and this mean guy that used to bully her. Hows   that   for revenge??!! Creeeppy...'come one come all, meet the the Incredible Shrinking Girl Who Sucks Up Your Fat!!' eeeek.....   4. Start on essay research, which eek, are ALL due in FIVE weeks time! (one of the classes is TV Cultures, and have been doing   tonnes   of research for it - heheh watching the tube that is....)  5. Finally change the 'Shpiel of the Week'  And now off to bed. I hate early classes. zzzzz  Drop me a flooble or  urlLink SIGN MY GUESTBOOK!!
A new dawn awaits   All right! I have a new job up, and it's starting tomorrow! Excitment - it's just a simple cafe job, and I'm not sure what my duties exactly are, but it's in school and it's income so I'll try my best. Really need favour in the manager's eyes!  Phew, getting this job was such an ordeal, mostly becasue I've never received any replies to the resumes I sent out over the hols. But maybe it's good 'coz mebbe God wanted me to hold out for this, esp. since in school, and I got to fully devote my time in the hols to doing me-stuff, and hang out with my sis.  Well, the cafe is run by these Shanghainese. I have no either what posessed me to do so, but I spoke to them in Mandarin! Argh, my half-past six broken Chinese. Eek.  It all started innocently enough. I went down to the cafe, dropped off the CV, spoke to the manager in English, he in his Chinese-accented English too.  The following week, I got a missed call from them, so I called back. The guy I spoke to (who wasn't the manager though), started speaking to me in Mandarin, so that's how it all started. I went down the next day with my timetable, and spoke to the manager in Mandarin, thinking, after all, hey I handled a whole conversation yesterday in the language, I can do this too. The manager seemed a little surprised at my speaking Mandarin though. Whatever it was, I was really proud of the fact I asked for his name before I left in the polite Mandarin form:    Oh, dui bu qi, qing wen ning gui xing?   (Oh excuse me, by the way, may I know your name?)  To which he replied: Oh,   Jah-mes    Teeheeheee...yeppers,  Jahmes  teeheeeheee  He called later that week, woke me up on a Friday morning, asking me (in Mandarin of course) if I could start work the following week. YES!! I was really happy - Praise God! Thing is, that early in the morning, ( 11  a.m. mind you - I mean who wakes up at   such  an ungodly hour?), I couldn't form the proper words to reply in Mandarin. So you can imagine how the conversation went:    Qing wen ze shi Huang xiao jie shi ma?   (Pardon me is this Miss Wong?)    Ahh..shi shi!   (Yes, yes!)    Wo shi chong XXX cafe da lai de.   (I'm calling from XXX cafe.)    Oh dui dui dui!   (Oh yes yes yes!)    Oh dui dui dui.  (Was he making fun of me??)  Qing wen ni zhao dao gong zuo le ma?   (Oh yes yes yes. May I ask if you've found a job yet?)    Oh hai mei you.   (Oh not yet.)  Blah blah blah...I was really struggling with it. He was asking me if I could shift my subjects around so I could work on Tuedays and Wednesdays. I just simply couldn't articulate properly what I wanted to say, and had to repeat myself a couple of times, peppering my broken Mandarin with a smattering of English words, like Timetable etc. Ughhh.  Finally, after everything was settled, I was about to say bye when he said,     Ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor?   (Your Mandarin really isn't very good is it? -> said as more of a statement than a question)   I was stunned to say the least. So I just said the only thing that popped into my head.    Hah??   (Hah??)    Wo shuo ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor?   (I said your Mandarin isn't very good is it?)    Oh dui, er, nah shi ying wei, er, Ying Wen shi wo di yi ge, er, language.   (Oh yes, er, that is because, er, English is my first, er, language.)    Nah ni jiu jiang Ying Wen ba.   (You can speak in English then.)    Oh hao, hao.    (Oh, yes yes -> I mean I really didn't know what to say. It just threw me! Sigh - Shanghainese are famous for their bluntness)    Xia ge xing qi jian.   (I'll see you next week then.)    Ah, dui.   (Ah, yes.)  E-Gene, who overheard the conversation, put it very succintly: 'Man, your Chinese really sucks!'  Sigh.

Tribute   Yes the weather is fine today on the red carpet. Fans are cheering wildly as the winners arrive for the annual Bloop Awards, bearing bright smiles and the prerequisite V-for-victory sign for paparazzi pictures.

Well, ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, the winner of the Great Buddy Award is none other than...drum roll please...Bharatha Moorthy of Serangoon Avenue 2!!  For your compassionate concern and calling me all the way from Singapore after reading my Blog and finding out about my short hospital trip, worrying when I didn't answer the phone the first time, and for also reassuring my sister that I was all right (who incidentally didn't even KNOW what had happened 'coz she hadn't been reading my blog - so much for keeping tabs on me), I dub thee my GREAT BUDDY!

Please exit to your left and would you kindly refrain from stealing the decor pieces on your way out. Good night!   *Long-Suffering Award
Hee hee hee...   Got this link via  urlLink  Debbie's Blog  , and....
New Additions   I have just composed my first limerick, all in the space of 5 minutes on Friday, after Evie told me we were going Doncaster for Yum Cha!   My First Limerick    There once was a girl from Doncaster Who liked to eat chips, wood and plaster She fell ill one day Got taken away Leaving her house looking somewhat lacklustre   Geddit? Geddit? She was eating her house that's why she was ill and...and... (silence from the audience)  Sigh, unfortunately My First Limerick hasn't quite taken off...no rave reviews, and recitations have been met by either puzzled looks or blank expressions. Ah wells...maybe next time.  What do YOU think of it? (And also the Brinjal Song)? Drop me a flooble or leave a bl00p!!
JM is playing   Just found out that John Mayer is playing at the HiFi Bar at Swanston Street on 29th October! That's exactly one month from today!! Woopeedoo! Will definitely go check it out man...yay!!
That Purple Vegetable    Music: Am listening to  urlLink  John Mayer's  Room for Squares   . VERY VERY nice!! I highly recommend it for your (easy) listening pleasure...   Here's another Silly Song with Sarah!!    The Brinjal Song (aka An Ode to E-Gene)    You're a Purple Brinjal You like to dance and sing When you shake your brinjal butt It makes a sound that goes ding ding   Ok ok I know, why is EG a brinjal? Just thought he looks like one lah. Btw, do you know the other names for Brinjal are Aubergine and Eggplant? Teeheehee...that said, I don't really like eating it, unless it's the Lasagne-version that Wally taught me to make....very very yummy!   Brinjal-Lasagne Recipe   1. Fry brinjal till translucent (like how you would an onion I guess) 2. On baking tray lined with baking paper, place a layer of fried brinjal 3. Pour spoonfuls of spaghetti sauce on top of the brinjal 4. Repeat with additional layers of brinjals and sauce until desired height 5. Top off with a sprinkling of cheese (parmesan, mozzie, tasty, chedder, swiss, whatever you like) 6. Bake in oven till cheese has melted (I usually put it at a really high temperature so I don't have to wait too long...but that means you gotta watch it so it doesn't burn)  Voila! Yummy brinjal-lasagne!
What a day...  I spent a very enjoyable weekend so far. Friday was spent at the DFO near Moorabin airport, with lotsa nice cheap stuff to buy...got a pair of Just Jeans for $39.95, and EG bought me a pair of slippers for $12. And I got sidetracked by a $12.95 top which I was totally indecisive about, and I didn't buy in the end...was too conscious that I'd eventually decide it wasn't flattering after I bought it and wouldn't wear it in the end...eep...  Yesterday was a great day spent with some church friends, a bunch I got closer to through the Alpha course we take in church. We had Yum Cha, then watched The Bourne Identity (featuring many out-of-focus shots), then watched a lil' footy (it was the Grand Final after all - the Brisbane Lions beat the Collingwood Magpies 75-66) on the big screen at Crown Casino while our friends played a lil' rapid roulette hehe...  I think it was pretty great when we came back and hung around, playing cards and a lil Twister. All in all, a very enjoyable day spent with them. I know how I've totally not really felt comfortable at ACCF, primarily because of the lack of a group of pple to hang out with, mostly 'coz they were  Aussie-Asian so there was a huge difference when we talked, even for simple slang terms and the wavelength. But this bunch is pretty cool - mostly Malaysians, but still got the   lors   and the  lahs  hehe... It's a great funny bunch of people - funny as in we laugh a lot.  Last night me EG and Shawn (and Evie for a lil' while) played Upwords...imagine the ingenuity that is involved when you really can't build any more words...we came up with stuff like 'Quita' (for quitter, said 'hood-style), 'Sista', 'Gemz', and we allowed Shawn's 'Fie' 'coz it's Ye Olde English...hehe. I really like playing board games with people, it's fun. I remember how every birthday and Christmas 'til I was 12, I'd get my parents to bring me to Toys R Us so I could get boardgames. I had Payday, Monopoly, Go for Broke, The Game of Life, Taboo (bought it on my 12th Christmas, and am still playing the game 10 years on, even though the set is a different one 'coz I lost the old one) and lots more. I loved, and still do love, boardgames...  My new obsession right now is crosswords puzzles, which I do with EG or whoever is available to hazard a guess at a seven-letter word for 'practiced boxing' (answer below*). That said, I'm stumped at an eight-letter word for 'announces'. The 6th letter is an R though...anybody can help? Please post a flooble or a bl00p if you have any clues....thanks!!     * The answer is 'Sparred'
Jazz and the Charleston  Oooh..went to watch  urlLink The Cat's Meow   starring Kirsten Dunst, Cary Elwes and also Edward Hermann, Rory's grandad in Gilmore Girls, who plays William Randolph Hearst, the 1920s newspaper titan. Quick trivia: Did you know that Citizen Kane was supposedly based on his life (Hearst I mean, not Hermann).  The Cat's Meow is based on the novel written by Elinor Glyn, about what really happened on a yachting trip in 1924. Actually, 15 November 1924, to be exact - hehe my birthdate! ooooooooh...  Movie and the webstie have really nice 1920s-style songs...it's actually playing in the BG as I type. And the Charleston dances they did seemed pretty funky too hehe.  Am plannign to watch Lilo n Stitch later, prob at Highpoint. Some lighthearted 'toon eh to jazz up the week. Man, I've really been watching lotsa movies these couple of days...prob to make up for the months of abstinence hehe.  okies, cheerio. And please remember, flooble's down, so leave a bl00p (comment lah)!
Yueah Babay...   I have returned from watching Goldmember. Hmmm...dunno why, didn't laugh as much as I thought I would...maybe my expectations were a little high? I know, I know...how do u have high expectations when u watch Austin Powers right? But no, I actually like watching shall we say, *Doctor Evil-style finger quotes* 'stupid'  movies...like American Pie, Road Trip (although Tom Green was *trey* gross) and the list goes on...  Overall, i think the best part of the show was the cameos in the beginning and the West-Side Story song n dance sequence... pretty nifty legwork I would say. Beyonce Knowles had great abs, bland acting - no sparkles there.   The highlight was doing the typical Singaporean thing after the movie - supper! Except it was more like dinner 'coz we hadn't eaten. We took our first trip to Bismi! A regular Prata shop, in Melbourne! With yummy prata and teh tarik, and it was pretty cheap too...full meal (2 pratas n tarik) for only $4.90. Yummers...  Oy...so full now... edge of puking.  My sis is leaving for Bristol tomorrow night. Just reading her blog makes me sad in away, like she'll be so much further away - it's not just a 2-3hr time difference anymore (depending on daylight savings), but much much more - the other end of the world! I will really miss her.   Somehow I feel and wish I could be a better sis n I dunno...be able to give her greater emotional support. I think I'm prob. one of those 'church'-type people who she referred to in her blog, who don't really know what to say and give tried-n-true advise, 'coz I probably don't understand the emotional turmoils she goes through. I'm less angsty I guess. The 2 of us are quite different in many ways, even since we were young. She tended to rebel and question the system, and still does (which i'm very proud of actually, she doesn't just accept things 'as they are', unlike me), while I just happily went about my way... sure we'd fight all the time thought - hated each other when we were kids, and I really thought she was a pest when I was in secondary school  - i remember once, when i went back to get my 'O'-level results, n she popped by to find out how i did (she was in Sec 1 then), and I was like 'Why you come?...aiyah just go back to your class lah'. I guess I really hurt her then. And even when she started hanging round my friends, like the Old Awake friends, and the Tsunamit people - i guess i didn't like her infringing on my 'territory'.  Irony is, she's prob closer to them now than I ever was... :-)  I think one thing that stands out vividly in my mind when we were kids was that she always had a flair for the dramatic. On a trip to China, she stood at the front of the bus, in her little white jumpsuit and rainbow-coloured checked shirt, and sang into the mike connected to the bus' audioo system, while everyone clapped and cheered along. Wah lau eh - attention seeker! haha...But there was a really sweet side to her too. We had had a fight, or a brawl should i say, what with the pinching scratching hairpulling etc. I think i hit her too hard, and she started crying and ran to my mum, who took the cane out. I ran to the corner, and was really prepared for a whacking man, 'coz she really looked pissed. And then my sis ran in front of me, spread her hands out, and said 'No! Don't beat   jie jie !!' So sweet right? In my head I was thinking 'Wah lau eh, trying to act again! Watch too much Channel 8 serials ....' but at the same time still relieved coz my mum's face softened....haha :-) Oh the stories of childhood.  To Tess, if you're reading this b4 your flight tomorrow. Take care, God bless, and you'll do fine in Bristol. I love you very very much.  Goodnight.
Poke the Penguin   Poke  urlLink this cutie  and find out what happens!
Yay!!   Oh happy happy sunshine song! I have completed 3 of the essays due today, and the 4th's due the day after the hols end. Yippee! Can at least relax for a bit over the weekend.  Tomorrow will be spent at church in the afternoon, then it's Goldmember at night...muahahhah. And Sunday's gonna be a potluck dinner with lotsa friends, sorta celebrate the end of the term and the beginning of the 2-week break. Yay...  Excitement!  Today was pretty taxing...only started writing the TV Cultures today, and it's due at 4pm! Had planned what to wirte etc. last night, so wasn't supposed to take too long, but ah wells...in the end, finished at 4.30pm (500 extra words, eep, hope i don't get penalised), rushed to get everything printed out, reached school at 5.30pm. But it wasn't too bad, I think they might not count it as late 'coz they usually check essays on monday mornings anyways. Whatever it is, nothing I can do now.  Very sleep deprived...aching body...  In lieu of flooble, leave a comment!
Blooble the Flooble   Oh where, oh where has my flooble gone? Oh where, oh where can it be? With its comments features And user interactivity Oh where,oh where can it be?
RATE ME!!   Just below the flooble box on your left, there's a lil' place where you can rate my blog. So please do! Even if it is unfavourable. (er but at least let me know  why  you think it sucks so I can improve...)
Tired...   EEk..the last leg of my essay mash..trying to read all the stuff on domesticity for TV Cultures essay, except I did EXACTLY what the readings said lotsa pple so with TV..watch it in the background.   How intertextual/postmodern is that? A reading of me reading my readings while participating in the reading of televisual forms. Burp.  Ever tried speed reading? I did what I was taught eons ago in secondary school - place a finger in the middle of the sentence, and try to read the whole thing without moving yr eyeballs. Theory is to encapsulate the sentence at a glance, letting your mind fill in gaps in the sentence (ie pick out key words). IT'S NOT POSSIBLE without incurring any serious injury. Verdict: V.V. painful, only try if you're already   pah ciao    I saw my TV Culture's lecturer at the gelati place just now - what a coinkidink (sarah-speak for 'coincidence'). Don't think he recognised me though. Which was just as well...  Sleep now....
I Recommend...  Yep there's been a spate of hilarious eccentricity going on in the Wong household back in S'pore. To find out more, please (and I beg you to) go to  urlLink My SIS' BLOG  , 'coz this time round, I literally choked with laughter (on an Arnott's Mint Slice no less) while reading it...
Feminista   I've recently come across this website, called  urlLink Big Bad Chinese Mama  . It's a really interesting website posing as an asian mail order bride service that serves to, as the manifesto says, catch men in the act (of porn-ing).  I sent the website's url round to a couple of close friends, little knowing the stir it caused. But it was a really good stir, as in we started debating about the site's effectiveness at subverting patriarchal oppression, whether it's too controversial and nihilistic with the male-bashing and all.  This was what I wrote:   In my humble opinion, I figure that our resident big bad mama is not simply ranting against the patrairchal standards of today. However much we can argue about gender equality, about our roles in society, about men and women walking hand in hand towards that great light of peace and harmony, she is using humour as a way to deconstruct the ideologies of femininity today. (I've personally used the same approach, albiet in a less confrontational way, to satirise the global female fashion industry in my project for class last year - yes yes, boast boast teeheehee)  It's a pretty in-your-face, confrontational gesture i suppose. What I think is good about the site is that it stands to subvert current norms of thinking, through parody. Yeah, we're pretty much living in a post-everything world, post-feminist, post-modern yadayada. The fight has been fought, the battle has been somewhat won, but the war for equality still goes on (wow, how prosaic...). Like Velle said, the branches of feminsism stretch far and wide; i think it's all down to the whole personal-as-political approach again - i.e. if you feel that women and men play diff roles, so be it. If you feel we should use whatever power we have (sexual or otherwise) to do whatever we can to climb to the top and change things from within , so be it.  Personally, I'm more of the humour-works-to-deconstruct kinda thing. Mostly 'coz (a) my kinda humour does not serve to uphold my pretty lotus blossom image (yes i can hear the coughs in the background! i know who you are!!), and (b) i have a pretty wacked out sense or humour and damn, i'm proud of it!  Also, i think the fact that we're debating and thinking about it (the website as well as feminism at large) legitimises the topic anyways - yay! one up for the womyn!!   Another point I want to make is also this:  The fact is, that the issues for women today lies not in debating about feminism, or taking up the cause or whatever. When we discuss women's issues casually,  (even with the same women who took my feminsit film n tv theory class last sem), and I say that i'm a feminist, it's always greeted with a blank stare and 'oh, so what do you do?'. Everyone equates feminism with activism and the bra-burning butch stereotype. I think feminism today is more subversive, and with the use of new technology (unfortunately a world equated with the techno-geeks-are-usually-men idea), that's what bigbadchinesemama.com aimed to do.  I mean I told my friend I use to clean my boyfriend's bathroom for him, and she said 'oh, you're definitely not a feminist that way'. I had to explain, firstly I liked cleaning bathrooms coz it was cathartic for me in a weird way (must be all the fumes i've been inhaling from the Jif bottle), and secondly he wasn't free to do it and we needed to get it sparkling for the real estate agent's inspection, and thirdly it's nice to do something for someone, man or woman. If she had asked me to clean her bathroom for her, I would have (if and only if it wasn't in too deplorable a shape!!!).  Sigh...the defences we have to keep coming up with...  Friday the 13th (of Sept 2002)
2 down...  2 more to go. Yep, finished with my Italian National Cinema essay, as well as MarComm. Now it's on to Hollywood and TV Cultures! And I've only 1 week! Yipes!!  *quick number crunching*  That's about 4 days for each...including research for TV Cultures, reading and planning for the Hollywood presentation on Monday morning, and writing both 1500 essays. EEPS!  Grace grace...
A Tribute to Shawn the Koala-who-thinks-he's-a-pirate   *ahem*   You're a little Ko-ah-lah   (menacing 'arrhhhh' courtesy of Shawn, along with curled paws and scrunched shoulders)  You're my little Ko-ah-lah (arrrrhhhh)   You like to suck on Eucalyptus   You're a little Ko-ah-lahhhh (arrrrhhhh)    It all began when Shawn dyed his hair, so it looks like he's got a lil' tuft of red on top. Then this lady at a shop he patronised said he looked realllll cute, like a, like a koala!   And then this ditty came to me just now, while we were just standing round the kitchen, and I was drinking my tea, and he was washing the dishes. Yep, inspiration strikes everywhere!  12 Sept 2002
Alpha and Omega   I just returned from Alpha camp over the weekend, and it was thoroughly enjoyable. It was pretty far from Melbie though, in Upper Plenty, so far it was hardly on the Melway map. Eep. But the place was so fantastic! The  dorm rooms, the toilet, all really neat and clean, esp. the bathroom. All the amenities you needed, great food plus A REAL FIREPLACE. What more could you ask for!?!!  We spent the 2D/2N there enjoying each other's company, and learning more about the Holy Spirit - part of the Alpha course I'm taking at church, sorta like a foundation back-to-basics of Christianity kind a thing. Real good stuff.  EG had a great time too. Probably 'coz there was some serious male bonding going on. Him and a bunch of other like-minded noisy guys, sitting around after lunch, talking about cars n stuff. SO blokey...I made my friend Alan promise never to turn into them, guys sitting around congratulating themselves on being the masters of the universe. He said no guarantees there. Sigh. What happened to all the Sensitive New Age Guys?   One highlight was learning Mafia, this really interesting game where someone gets 'killed' and you gotta find out who did it. Think Murderer meets Bluff meets Survivor and you get the gist. 3 Mafiosi, 1 Doctor, 1 Spy, and the rest are Civilians (9 people in all, plus 1 Game-master). You should see the heated debates as everyone tried to defend themselves and prevent who they thought were compadres from being voted out. VERY layered game, and you never know who's bluffing. Very fun, and also very interesting 'coz you've got this group of Christians who are essentially lying to each other...hmmm....hehe  Anyways, it was a great experience, and I'd definitely do it again if I had the chance. Right now, slogging n trying to keep up with the essay schedule. Cheerios
Blog Connection   If there is just ONE thing you must do today, please, PLEASE read  urlLink MY SISTER'S BLOG  , specifically the entry named 'Dangerous' (dated 6/Sep/02).  There you'll have a delightful insight to the inner workings of my neurotic family, and finally, truly understand why I am the way that I am....
It All Makes Sense Now!!    As you all know, I've been writing Silly Songs (aptly named Silly Songs with Sarah) for awhile now. To the unenlightened, Silly Songs are basically ditties that just pop into my head once in awhile, outta blue, totally off-guard. They could be lyrics to well-known songs (a la Weird Al Yankovic) or just, well, songs with a tune.  Here's a sample:   (To the tune of Kylie's 'I Just Can't Get You Outta My Head')   I just can't get you outta my spleen Boy oh boy do I need anti-fungal cream   Also:   (To the tune of P.O.D.'s 'Alive')   I can't see at night For the very first time I believe I am blind So blind  I can't drive past nine Otherwise I'll die But night blindness is fine So fine     Anyways, I just came across, in one of my readings, a man named Philip J. Kitchen!! So now this ditty I came up with a YEAR ago, FINALLY makes sense!   *Ahem*   Kill Kenny Chicken....But don't kill the Kitchen.... (repeat)   Please don't ask me who Kenny Chicken is. I have no idea. Just some figment of my subconcious I suppose. BUT! Now we DO know how kitchens can be killed - when they're human!! Heeheeheeteeheehee... (Previously,  'don't kill the kitchen' came with a 'with germs lah!' reply to people's perplexed expressions.)  There of course have been times when these ditties have come back to bite me on the ass, unintentionally of course (no malicious content, and all G-rated songs ok?!). I recorded one as my voice-mail message, and left it there for quite awhile. Thing is, a potential employer for this job I really wanted to try out for after I graduated, but which I thought wouldn't come through 'coz he hadn't called for months since I put the application in, finally gave me a tinkle on the phone! And I didn't hear the phone. So it got redirected. And he heard the song. And this was the message he left:  'Er, wow...that's er real interesting er....anyways, this is Colin Gomez from Perfect 10....just wondering blah blah...'  ARGHFFF!!   5 September 2002
Run Forrest Run!     I went for a run just now. Sick of just moaning about me weight and fat, and took action!! yay.  EXCEPT. My feet are killing me! I'm slightly flat-footed so it really hurts when it's pounding on the ground. The run wasn't too bad at all - 1min jog, 1 min walk. Nice pace. But the feet...oy the feet...  In other news, just heard that SIA might be resurrecting Ansett - the airline company gone bust here. Hmmm...  In other other news, am doing MarComm n my lecturer is a major slacker. Can't be bothered to put the lecture notes up on the net, which he's been promising to do so, so I don't have access to the notes I missed. And there were many.  Whatever it is, am so positively swamped with work now. Really need grace to get through this!! Which is why I haven't been bloggin much hehe. Sorry guys...  Okies, better get back to the daily grind....
The Day When Many Things Happened  Let's start at the very beginning...a very good place to start...   12 pm   Woke up feeling really shitty, 'coz the night before I was all tense about my Italian Cinema take home exam question, which I had no idea how to write 'coz it had to center around 2 specific topics from a list. One topic, Migration, I could relate to the film (Looking for Alibrandi), but I had absolutely no clue which other to pick.  So I just read my Bible, and it seemed specifically tailored for me, talking about how we should rejoice in trials. To quote some movie I watched, 'That which doesn't break us only makes us stronger'. Was it Arnie? I don't remember.  So I decide to just pick one of the topics,  Mezzogiorno , and find out more about it, 'coz (a) it was part of the week's readings on Post War politics, which I could possibly link to Alibrandi and Migration, and (b) 'coz I wanted to know what it actually meant in English.  Typed in a search in askjeeves, and voila! It basically refers to the South Italy region, encompassing Sicily, Calabria etc. Woopee! Italian-Australian immigrants always harken back to their homeland, esp. Sicily, and it was done so in Alibrandi. Yay! Praise God.   1.30 pm  Mobile phone rang and I ran to pick it up. The caller ID said 'Anonymous', so it was from a private number. 'Hello? Is this Sarah?' 'Yes, it is.' 'Hi, I'm Mike from Gloria Jean's Coffees? I received your email early this morning. Could you come in sometime for an interview?'  In short, I'm meeting Mike, who's wearing a black shirt, tomorrow regarding a position as a barista/customer service staff at a new store they're opening on Bourke Street. Praise God for opportunities. I also applied for another job, a Call Centre one (answering questions on an upcoming govt. campaign), but they haven't got back to me.   3.15 pm  Am still on the bleeding tram when I should be in class already. I'm giving a presentation for my Italian Cinema class!   3.25 pm  Phew, class hasn't started yet. Prayer really works.   3.55 pm  Presentation went ok. Everyone was anxious to go to the pub (rest of tute lesson @ pub.  Cool huh?) so they weren't really listening. What to do, it's the last tute for the semester. Anyways, didn't join them - on to the next presentation, for TV Cultures.   4.00 pm  Well the Multimedia festival went well, though it ended late. Everyone's presentation was really good! Sadly, ours didn't win a prize (4 prizes for 7 groups, plus door prize draws). My 'honourable mentions' go to the group that talked about Phua Chu Kang and syntax, and also the guy that did celeb impersonations of Ozzy Osbourne and Bill Cosby talking about global television. V. funny.   8.00 pm  Doors open for the John Mayer concert! YAYYYYY!!   8.30 pm  Charlton Hill, an Aussie group sporting a cute front man perform. Really rocked the crowd. Not bad tunes - esp. the radio single, 'Two's Company' (at least that's what I think the title is).   9.45 pm   JM comes on stage!!! YAY!!!!  It was a fantastic concert, and the crowd was good, rocking and rolling along. I must say a lot for his musicianship - he's pretty good at the guit., and his voice is great too. He's fabulous to see 'live' too  - interacted with the crowd and all. Overall, nice prep/rock look - he was wearing a shirt, which was drenched by the end of the night.  Hehe, we sneaked in an MD player and recorded the entire thing! Although I talked at a couple of instances. And sang along too. Eep. Hopefully my voice doesn't come out, so the recording doesn't turn into  'John Mayer in Melbourne - the Karaoke Version'.  Charles read on his website that JM's actually fine with pple recording his performances, esp. since it's a good form of promotion. As long as $$ doesn't change hands. It's fine to let your friends have a copy and all. Now that, I think, is the right attitude to have. With all the hoo-haa over piracy and music and downloading MP3s and all, sometimes it's nice to have an artiste not being so  ngim-jim  over money. I mean, the record companies are having hernias over the whole piracy issue, mostly 'coz of the money they say they're losing. Get with the program - not making AS MUCH as you thought you would does NOT qualify as a loss. Most times they don't just break even, they have lotsa profits. Hello, Metallica?  Well, spending those few hours bouncing up and down was really fun, esp. since I got to share it with my 2 best friends in Melbourne, EG and Charles. We were standing in front of the speakers (oh my poor ears, I should have brought my ear plugs. They're still ringing now, more on the left ear though), @ the left side facing the stage. Irritated EG a lil' though, 'coz he was the designated photog. (he being tall and all), and I kept bugging him to take more photos. 'How many shots of him singing do you want? One with every light change issit?' 'No lah! But if can change angle also good lor. Maybe I should go the other side to take?' 'Tell you what lah. I'll scan the photo and then flip it around for you ok?'  Hehe.  Highlight of the concert? I went home with a souvenir - a signature guitar pick that one of his roadies threw in my direction after the concert. Yippeee!  Next up, Emily of Emerald Hill on Thursday. And possibly Bic Runga next month. (I'm still lamenting the Jamiroquai concert though. Really wanted to get tix early on, but no one to go with! Finally found out Johanna's going, but she's got tix already, and they're seated ones, not general admission  - apparently the GA ones are sold out. BOOHOOOOOO).   11.50 pm  Walked out of HiFi Bar.   2.26 am  Just finished this Blog entry. Going to sleep now. Nitey nite, I've an interview in the morning.  29 October 2002
Darrnit  Arghf. I'll be missing my sis' performance at  urlLink Sonic Fest 2002  'coz I won't be back then.  And it sounds like such a great gig too!  Ah wells...sigh...
Announcement!!     NEW SHPIEL    NEW SHPIEL   NEW SHPIEL   NEW SHPIEL   NEW SHPIEL   NEW SHPIEL             (the column on your left...)
I'm still here  In case everyone's wondering, I'm fine and no, I haven't flopped out of my goldfish bowl. Speaking of which, there's a new ad on TV right now featureing fishes swimming around a baby in his cot - for some sorta baby monitor by Fisher and Paykel I think. Not sure - if anyone has seen it, let me know.  It's essay crunch time again, which means I've been  piahing  or at least trying to  piah  for my essays, 1 due next Friday, and 3 due the following Friday. As you can tell, my days are packed and dreary, and I've gotten to know the Law Library pretty well, at least the section where I spend sitting on my butt and reading/typing.  On an upside, next week are the John Mayer and Emily of Emerald Hill performances. Quite excited for it. Yes, I know, strange that I'm going to see Ivan Heng in drag (once again) as everyone's favourite  bibik  in Melbourne, when I can see him in drag back home, but I think tix are much cheaper here - only paid $19 for an evening show. Plus the theatre's so close to home, I can walk there. I wanted to check out other shows as part of the Melbourne festival too, but unfortunately, with essays and all prob. don't have the time.  Am also on a job hunt for Nov/Dec/Jan summer hols. This Customer Service Rep. job sounded quite promising, and they pay $16 an hour, so that's good. But I gotta revamp my CV first though, 'coz I think I need to sound more dynamic in order to get the job, instead of just blah blah, I did this and that. I'm taking tips from this guy at the seek.com.au website too. Now I just have to get around to doing it b4 they close applications.  On an upnote, tomorrow me EG n charles are finally going to the IMAX theatre b4 our 3-month ticket expires. Such a waste of money if we don't get around to using it!  Anyways, I'll prob. write more interesting stuff next week. Not that my life is entirely very interesting anyways hehe.   Tata  Oh yes, btw on Chuckie's recommendation, check out   urlLink this guy . We're planning to do something like what he suggests, giving out useful items and maybe cookies during Christmas, to the homeless.
Bel's B'day  I spent yesterday and today with Bel, celebrating her 22nd birthday. It was very enjoyable - yesterday we had a picnic at Fitzroy Gardens, with E-Gene. I got her a picnic lunch for her b'day (sigh, which I still feel is a kinda cheapo prezzie...) and also baked a cake. We had sandwiches, potato gems, crackers with kabana sausages and tasty cheese, herb and garlic cheese spread, strawberries and apples, and coke to wash it down. Throughly enjoyable, and the company was good :-)  Today we went to South Melbourne beach - took the tram down. We spent a couple of hours on the sand, talking about stuff, from relationships to people to school. Then had tea at a cafe and talked some more. Then had dinner with people from her church - mostly her housemate, Jean's friends, one of whom I found out much later was Wally's housemate! Wow...hehe. Dinner was fun, at this place called Malaya Inn in Doncaster - nice yummy food like  Or Jian  (fried oyster omelette), fish head curry, sambal kangkong etc. And even bowls of chicken soup! Mmmmm... It was followed by coffee at Brunetti's, which I hadn't been to since it's renovation. Didn't stay long though, 'coz Charles n EG came to pick me up soon, after their dinner and M1 concert.  The people I met today seemed really nice - would like to hang out more with them if I could. Nice to get to know new people. I'm also beginning to hang out more with a bunch of people from church, which is great (and a long time coming, considering I've been at ACCF for more than a year). Guess I'm finally fitting in and finally finding my place in the scheme of things - esp. 'coz of Alpha.  Btw, I've graduated from Alpha course on Wednesday, with my own certificate and everything! Alpha is sorta a back-to-basics course in Christianity, which EG and I attended, and after many months, finally finished it off reinforcing the knowledge we have, and making many new friends!  Anyways, back to today. I'd wanted to bring my camera and take lotsa pics, so that I could stick it into an album or collage for Bel to remember, but ARGHFFF!!! Forgot the camera!! Sigh...sad right? There goes a nice prezzie idea...  Chatting with Bel was nice. It's interesting how our friendship had evolved - I never really liked her from the start (which she tells me is what happens with practically every girl she meets - they automatically don't like her for some reason, so poor thing right? She says sometimes she acts a lil' bimbotic, just to seem more affable to people, 'coz she's naturally assertive. Me, I don't have that problem - I'm naturally bimbotic! heheheh). I didn't like her then 'coz I must admit I was a lil' intimidated by her, 'coz she's quite confident and assertive (and also very babe hehe, which I still think so), plus her manner wasn't very, I dunno, warm n friendly? A little aloof sometimes, and when she was friendly, she seemed superficial, and very PR. Plus we didn't have much in common to talk about too.   But we get along better now, and talk about stuff. She made a good point, that we should try to hang out when we're both in S'pore, or it'll seem like we just hang out with each other here and now 'coz we don't have any other close girlfriends here. Thinking about it, it's partly true though, 'coz Bel and I aren't exactly personality matches in a way - but that's 'coz our friendship is still progressing. Let me explain.  I personally think everyone has friendships with others on different levels. Like how I interact with people like say Charles, or Velle and Priyanca, is different how I interact with Bart, is different from how I interact with Bel, different from how I interact with my housemates, and different for EG (of course). With the first category, and also with my housemate Evie, I'm a lil' crazier and silly, and loonier . But when I'm with EG or Shawn, a lil' less loony and loud ('coz EG keeps telling me I'm too loud), with Bart I'm more affectionate, and with Bel I'm more sedate, 'coz we're still establishing our friendship, and haven't come to that super-comfortable point yet. I think the true litmus test will be to see her reaction to one of my Silly Songs! Then I'l know...hehehe
My Mobile Phone...Literally (Part 2)   I walked slowly towards the tram stop... all the while feeling sad, and praying. 'Oh Lord...help!'  Suddenly I stopped in my tracks. Waitaminit! Wait a minute! Before I left the lecture hall, I threw a plastic bag into the bin. Now it had made an unusually loud 'thunk' when it landed, which was why I picked it up again and looked at the contents of the bin. But I didn't see anything, so figured maybe a can or something just toppled over when I threw the plastic bag in.  That 'thunk' could've been my phone! As I recall, I was holding my phone in my right hand - I must have let it go along with the plastic bag!  Excitement bubbled up inside me. I ran for the security station again, praying in tongues all the while. Panting and out of breath, I knocked on the window. 'Angelo! I..gasp..think...gasp...it could be in..gasp...hold on, I'm gasping too much...'  I explained my theory, and he just laughed good-naturedly. 'Sarah! You're killing us!' He called Keith again, and I ran to meet him at the underground parking garage to walk back to the theatre.  We walked back in anticipation, as I apologised to Keith for making him walk back there again. I was telling God, 'if I can find it, I'm just gonna say 'Thank You Jesus!' and use this as testimony man! I was so sure...   We reached the theatre, and I ran for the bin. Pushing my sleeves up, I dug into the bin, which housed a few coffee cups, my KFC plastic bag, and used tissues. No phone.  But I knew I heard a 'thunk'! So I shifted the bin aside, and lo-and-behold, it was there!! Neatly resting against the wall, undamaged.  WOOPADEEDOOO PRAISE GOD!!  I jumped up and down in excitement, and even grabbed Keith's arm, shouting 'Thank You, thank you!' He smiled, and said, 'That's ok, as long as you don't make me come back here again!' I grinned back.  We walked out, and I kept thanking God. I suddenly remembered that I had promised to proclaim Jesus' name in this situation, and I'd forgotten to. Suddenly I felt nervous about it saying it out loud. I whispered loudly 'Thank you Jesus.' - don't know if Keith heard.  I realised I was being a chicken about it, so as we were walking I said, 'Wow, that's amazing, I really thought I'd lost my phone!' Keith turned and nodded. 'Yeah, it's really a MIRACLE that I found it, I mean, most people never find their phones! I really THANK GOD man. It's just so amazing. AMEN, amen!', I said, stressing on the erm...Christian-sounding words...  As we emerged from the shortcut through the carpark, I looked up at the sky, and suddenly everything seemed so beautiful to me. The trees, the damp ground, the cold air. I raised my hands a lil', and whispered 'Thank You Lord.'     EPILOGUE  I walked back towards the guard station with Keith. Before he left, I said thank you agian, and asked for his name, giving him mine as well - just in case we ever bumped into each other again around the campus. I walked up towards the guard window and waved at Angelo through the glass, holding my phone up for him to see. He smiled. (Praise God btw, that the bunch of us were the last few to leave - that way I knew who was locking up, and so could locate Angelo at the guard station.)  I boarded the tram, and thanked God once again for his blessings. I bumped into another friend on the tram, and shared my testimony with her .  Our God's really an awesome God!
My Mobile Phone...literally   I walked towards the tram yesterday, as the wind blew and the last hints of twilight shone in the sky. It was about 6.40pm, and I'd just spent a good 45 mins or so just chatting with Jessie after lecture, while she waited for Tammy to finish class. I had a nice time, just having coffee and talking about school - Jessie's so easy to talk to.   Anyway, since it was pretty close to dinner time, I figured I'd better give EG a call n let him know I was on my way back. I reached into my jacket pocket...and found it empty!  'Arrrgh! Where could it be?' I checked my bag, rummaged through it. As the pit of my stomach started to swirl, my brain kicked in. 'I probably left it in the lecture hall or something. Better go find the security guard who locked it.' So i ran to the station, hoping to somehow locate the guard. He was there! Manning the station! Angelo was his name, a guy in his late 20s-30s, and he was kind (and friendly) enough to call another guard to walk with me back to the theatre, which was right at the other end of campus.   So me and Keith, this tall man with a moustache, probably in his 40s, walked in the cold back towards the theatre. 'Where else do you think it could be?'  'I don't know. The Baillieu Library probably...'  'Have you checked it?'  'No, not yet. Probably later.'  We walked up the steps to the theatre. I walked in, and searched the area where I sat. No phone. He looked up and down the theatre steps too. No phone either.  'Sigh, it's ok, I'll check with the library. Thanks!' 'Yep.'  I walked back towards the library, where I'd gone with Jessie to zap lecture notes. I put on my jacket there, so I figured it must have slipped out then. I checked with the librarians and the lost-and-found counter there. No deal. I tried calling EG on the payphone, and Jon's house phone, but no one picked it up.  My heart dropped as I registered the fact I'd probably have to spend a few hundred bucks to get a new phone. Money that I found hard to part with. All this while, I was begging the Lord 'please, Lord, please...', yet was resigned to the fact it was probably gone. People adhere to the finders-keepers mentality over here - I lost my sunnies a month back, and never saw it again. Let alone a phone!  I walked in dark back to the cafe where I had coffee with Jessie. It was probably closed though - it was already 7 plus. The ground was damp, the air cold. I shivered as my toes gripped my Birkie sandals. A light! People were still there! I knocked on the glass door. 'We're closed!' said the girl on the inside. I knocked again. She gestured with her hands, that they were closed. 'Hey John, there's someone at the door knocking!' she said in a nasal voice. John looked up. 'I'm sorry, we're closed'  DUH, I knew that already.  'I'm sorry, but did you guys see a mobile phone in here?' I yelled through the glass door. 'What?' 'I said I think I left my phone in here!'  He opened the side door, and I explained myself. 'Sorry, we just cleaned up, and didn't see anything.' 'Oh, it's ok' 'I'll leave a note in the the cafe, in case I find anything, so you can check back tomorrow?' 'Thanks.'  I trudged on, towards the Student Union info desk, in the vain hope that someone might have picked it up. It was closed.   I scrounged through my bag again, then decided to return to the library to call someone. The only other number I had memorised was Charles', so I called him. 'Charles!' I squawked, 'I lost my phone!'  'Huh? How?' 'Don't know lah. Must have dropped it somewhere. Do you have Chris' number? I'm trying to call pple at home but no one's picking up!' 'Ok, hold on ah...'  He gave me the number, and I lamented how I'd have to buy a new phone. He offered to sell me his other phone, the one he had but wasn't using at the moment. I said see how, still praying that I might find it.  I tried calling my phone, in case the person who found it picked up. Or at least if it was switched off, at least I knew for sure it was gone and could move on. It rang. And rang...and rang. It was on vibrator mode though, so maybe whoever had it didn't hear it.  I retraced my steps again. No phone. I gave up.     tune in tomorrow to read the next episode of... My Mobile Phone...literally
Why?    Why is it   that you can never repeat that fresh-from-salon look, even after spending hours adding mousse to your hair?  My hair looks more bobbish than sleek n funky. I don't know how the guy at the salon did it, with his creme and his scrunching fingers, but it looks weird now....sigh. Or maybe 'coz I'm trying to do it with bed-hair, and not freshly blown & washed hair. Whatever it is, I can't repeat the look. Sigh...sob.    Why is it  that even though your body is aching and tired, your mind is still awake so you just can't fall asleep?  I spent the other night in an insomniac stage, and ended up watching informercials. I am actually seriously considering buying one of the products, Winsor Pilates from the website! Hmmm...    Why is it  that even though I have things to do, like essays and such, I can never fully concentrate on them?  Instead I end up getting distracted by TV and the like. Oh there's the computer, oh, maybe I'm hungry...hmmm maybe I should go mend the hole in my t-shirt...    Why is it  that even though I have school later, and I haven't done my readings, and my stomach's rumbling 'coz I haven't had lunch, I'm still stuck here blogging, drawn like a moth to a flame?  Sigh...   In the words of that great poet, John Mayer, 'Tell me why...why Georgia why?'
Thanks   Thank you one and all for the support of   My First Limerick  ! As such, I have come up with another:   My Second Limerick  There once was a phone that rang all day But the person on line had nothing to say He'd hee and haw Then mee and maw Finally deciding he'd rather not play  Yeah, I know, it's not very good...I still like the Doncaster one better hehe...
Highlights of the Day    I streaked my hair RED!! And cut it short, till about chin-length. It was a very interesting experience at the hairdresser's, considering how it's actually a hair college - Pivot Point.   After months of looking longingly at the model on the poster at the salon, I finally did it. I love it actually...very vivid colour, and the cut's pretty good too. Everyone seems to think so (hehe), I got reviews from 'wicked!' and 'gorgeous!' to 'don't go back to long hair in a hurry!' and 'eh, quite nice ah, hor?'  Anyways, as I was saying, the hair college. This nice Korean lady, a student of course, cut me hair for me. It was an interesting experience 'coz she's only been in Australia for a year, so her English wasn't really good. We managed to communicate though. She reminded me of one of those Japanese housewives who you always see in those Jap soap dramas. I was talking to her, and found out she is graduating in December, and from there working at her mother-in-law's salon. Hmmm trying to impress the in-laws?  Well she was cutting it half-way, then her supervisor walked by, this tall hulking guy with bulging biceps, thick veins and a tight t-shirt. He took over for most of the haircut, showing her how to feather-cut my hair using a razor, an advance technique which she hadn't learnt yet. He did a pretty good job - looked nice n layered, and I think made my hair look a lil' finer. (*ahem* he also said I had great hair, and after the cut, he said I looked 'unreal' heheh....oh the praises...). I quite liked it, esp. considering I was afraid to cut too short in case it didn't fit my face shape.  The Korean lady, Jung, was also noting details about my hair in a form as we went along - a pre-requisite for the college I suppose. Flipping through it, I found out my hair is in Good Condition, Porous, and my scalp is Normal (yay, the Selsun Blue 5 for dandruff works!). And all this considering I blow-dry my hair EVERYDAY!  And the price? Are you ready for this? For a wash, cut, half-head highlights, and blow-dry, it's only $55! Fifty-five bucks! Wooohoooo!   Now if only I can get the same results the next time I return to the salon...sigh it always happens. Great the first time, but they can't seem to repeat the same thing the next time round...  After the cut, I went to Priceline and got some hair products - a bottle each of this new Sunsilk Frutrience for Coloured Hair shampoo and conditioner (which also got me a FREE Frutrience cosmetics/vanity bag) and also Wella mousse-wax. I tried the mousse just now, but it didn't have as much hold as I'd like (wanna try some funky upturned flips at the edges of my hair), so I might pop down to Priceline again and get the Styling Mud.  Well, as for tomorrow, I'd better start on that essay that's due on Monday! EEps! And I'll be busy on Saturday afternoon and a lil' on Friday too!! EEK!
Yummers   Had a very nice night today making really yummy strawberry yoghurt ice-cream. It's sitting in the freezer now, setting, and by tomorrow I should have a delightful dessert! Woopadeedoo!  That said, tomorrow also marks the beginning of essay work, 'coz I've an essay due on Monday. It's the Cont. Hollywood one, which I caught a lucky break - i.e turned out I had 2 extra weeks to do it. Eep. But have I spent the time wisely doing more research? No....Why? 'Coz I deserve a rest dammit! teeheehee...  Oh yes, went down to town today to alter 2 pairs of jeans. One was the Just Jeans one which I bought on Friday, the other a Sportsgirl one which I've been wearing a lil'  sua-ku-ly , i.e. with the hem folded up a huge chunk.   Did you know that alterations can be done and returned on the same day? I didn't! Thought I'd had to wait a couple of days 'coz of all the hemming and tailoring all these people must do. Well, as I found out, JJ has an in-house seamstress who does it on the spot. Unfortunately, she wasn't in today, so I left it to be collected tomorrow.  As for the Sportsgirl one, they send it out to be altered, to a place just across the road called Melbourne Central Tailoring. It was on the 1st Level of an office building, in a tiny little room at the corner. I almost thought I was on the wrong floor 'coz the lift doors opened to reveal a solicitor's office, with its tinted glass windows and couches. It was only after hearing voices from my left, and spying a small rack of blouses hanging near a door that I found the place, run by this really nice n friendly couple. The lady was talking to a Jeans West salesgirl (I figured JW also sent their jeans to be altered there...she was holding a couple of bags), so the man smiled and told me to hold on awhile. Real nice. And the price was right too! After calling several places earlier in the morning, I found out they were the cheapest, charging only $10 (yes, yes, please don't compare to Far East prices ok? If I were back home, I'd have gotten my grandma to do it for me for FREE - she was a seamstress after all). I'd have sent the Just Jeans pair to them too, except for the fact that JJ charges only $5.50 to do their own jeans, with a receipt of purchase of course.  All in all, am quite excited to collect them tomorrow. Yippee-kai-yay!
Beautiful Collision  She was shy, and looked a little uncomfortable to be on stage for all to see. But her voice was beautiful, enchanting, ephemeral even, as the notes that rolled off her tongue disappeared into the air, like little bubbles of lilting melodies popping in the darkness. She was funny too.  'Is someone smoking pot in here?'  'Did you know that giraffes communicate with each other into ultra-low sonic frequencies? I just saw that on the Discovery Channel. Yeah, 'coz I thought for the last song there where it goes  (sings a low tune) , the giraffes could have done it well.'   The band playing with her were pretty quirky and easy-going too, peppering the performance with comments and laughter. The group was fun to watch, and great to listen to - there was chemistry, and they seemed so relaxed and happy to be on stage, and were so totally devoid of the performance anxiety that grips most background musicians, who generally intensely focus on their playing and ignore the interaction-with-the-audience bit.  After the last song of the set (which was her hit single, Sway, from her debut album 'Drive'), she mimed to the audience that this was the last song, she was going off stage, we were supposed to clap, yell encore, and then she would come out again - hehe, acknowledging the farce that are 'last song' performances, 'coz there's ALWAYS an encore.  Confession: I teared when she sang 'Drive' as part of her encore performance, 'coz, I dunno, it sounded so melancholic, and it reminded me of my sis and how she'd describe the drive-arounds she'd have with Ken, and then I thought of my sis and how I missed her, and I dunno, the whole general atmosphere I suppose. Sigh, whadda wuss I am...  I think I might end up liking her first album more - will go take a listen and see if I'm right.    Check out  urlLink Bic Runga  and her latest offering  Beautiful Collision .    29 November 2002
Lock 'n Loll...   urlLink  Killing Heidi   ROCKED man! The gig was worth the 3 1/2 hour wait as 3 opening bands performed (KH came on at 11.55pm!!).  There we were, me and Debbie in the crowd up front as Charles, Jas and Kelly watched from an elevated step. Half the crowd in front of us were jumping up and down, the other half bopping, and the rest behind us watching with cool aloofness, while amidst all this stood two Asian girls head-banging their brains out, arms flailing about, looking like a cross between scarecrows on acid and chickens coming in for a landing. It was WILD. And it was Awesome. And it was pretty short - only about 1 hr long. We wanted MORE!!!  The gig left us on a natural high - Debbs wound the car window down and screamed into the night breeze, scaring the woman in the car next to us at the traffic light, while I just kept smiling and going 'Wooohooo!!'. A bunch of kookies we were. But we had SO much fun, and I haven't done this in a really long time, a couple of years in fact! So it was great to just let go at the gig, especially since we were anonymous beings in a sea of unknown faces. I'm sooooo glad I went, and sooooo glad that Debbie went too, to be my rockin' partner. 'Coz it's not really something you can do alone you know? You need a friend next to you, doing the same wild things, so you won't feel too insecure, even if there is a crowd of people around you. Two (banging) heads are a whole lot better than one!  Whatever it is, I highly recommend doing this. It's therapeutic. Let's lock 'n loll duuuuuuuudes!!
Rove Live  I hope the 'What the...?' I've sent in makes Rove's list for the final show next week.   Found on a 'Save the Environment' pamphlet by The Body Shop under 'Ways to save water':   Take a shorter shower, or SHOWER WITH A FRIEND!    What the...?         Do YOU have a 'What the...?' you can contribute? Please leave a bl00p or a flooble!!
Nice...  Had a nice day today, hanging out with Charles watching The Banger Sisters, and then having dinner and a date with EG.   I was bugging him after dinner to 'be spontaneous' and to 'go somewhere', like the beach or something. 'Coz we never really do anything like that, or go out on dates anymore - usually if it's just the 2 of us it's just running errands together or something. So yeah, had a nice time at St.Kilda Beach, and at the cafe at the end of the pier. We talked and laughed and joked around, and generally had a great time.   Anyways, major event. EG found my keys! We initially thot he'd lost it, and we'd have to cough up money to get a new one requested from the Body Corporate, 'coz it's a security key. But wot a miracle! See, he's been in and out of his car countless times since yesterday night, when he'd thought he'd lost it. He'd driven to church to search, to the post office, and today he drove to church, reparked the car etc. All in all, he was in the car MANY MANY times. And today, after work at the church office, there it was, lying on the seat, in broad daylight, as if someone had just placed it there! Freaky, no? Either someone had somehow gotten into his car, taken the key, made a copy or something, and placed it back there (without stealing the car or breaking any windows...), or a miracle was at work. Touched by an angel eh? They must've been watching.  In other news, got the Bic Runga CD, Beautiful Collision today at JB HiFi, for $18!! Can u imagine? I'd wanted to buy it earlier, so good thing I didn't. I was even in JB HiFi yesterday, but just bought the Killing Heidi album (which I'm really enjoying rite now), figuring since I had an online voucher I could use for the CD. That didn't work out, which was just as well, 'coz today was the start of the JB HiFi Christmas sale! Can anybody say woohooo?  *wooohooo* (echo...echo...echo....)  Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat's right...
Music makes the people come together...  How would I describe by taste in music?  I say, eclectic. Or in other words,  rojak .  I never really listened to music, other than Christian Praise n Worship growing up, since I was living with parents who thought 'rock music is not edifying to your soul. Why listen to all this trash when you can listen to something good?' Not quite 'rock music is from the devil', though pretty close. But it does make a lotta sense in retrospect I guess.  After discovering that there was alternative Christian music (ie. same genres like rock, dance etc. but with Christian or more sanitised language), I was into that for awhile. Esp. since Jars of Clay was pretty cool.  Then it was Bossa Nova, and all that Jazz.  Now? I dunno. I listen to anything and everything. A bit of Killing Heidi, a little Diana Krall, some Foo Fighters, some John Mayer, a twist of Disco Montego, a dash of Bebel Gilberto and Jobim, some Cafe del Mar series.   Like I said, it's pretty rojak. After a long time trying to figure out my music tastes, I realised I can blend in as easily into a jazz lounge as I can in a mosh-pit (like this Sat. at the KH gig - phew, gonna get me some bruises). Woohooo! I shall not be typecast! I am a unique individual that subscribes to a blend of commercial music! hur hur...  Most underrated band? A New Zealand outfit called  urlLink  Eight  , who came down to S'pore a couple years back. I met the guys, and they were really really nice, and funny too (although a couple of the ones I knew have left since). Their music's really different, so if you get a chance to check 'em out, it'll be great. I personally can't really describe the music, or put it in any category. I call it weird-but-definitely-listenable. They call it rock.   And they're playing for Big Day Out in New Zealand next Jan too! kewl huh? Darn, too bad not in Oz, although NZ is a hop skip and jump away...hmmm...holiday?   PS. Happy Birthday Kenneth!!   21 November 2002
Training again  Today's 5 hr shift was slow, but still cool. I made my first full coffee drinks, as in mailk and foam and all and served to customers. Mike, my boss, said I did a pretty good job, and the foam really turned out well, so I'm pretty happy! Yay! Favour Lord!  Learned to clean the machines too. Next week, I'll be doing the busy morning periods - 7.30-9.30am, where the orders just keep pouring in. Hooooo....it'll be tough...
Training  It went really well, and the time just flew past. 3 hrs taken up in a whirl of coffee making and pounding. And there's more tomorrow. I can honestly say I'm really enjoying myself. It's was really fun, and not too stressful, 'coz the Queensberry n Lt. Bourke store isn't as bz as the rest of the GJs outlets in town.  In other news, my silly iron has broken down. Maybe the fact I'd dropped it accidentally from the ironing board has something to do with it. Maybe, just maybe. Whatever it is, it's gonna be hell to fix. Erp.  My cough and slight flu is still going on. All the honey drinks and gargling with Listerine doesn't seem to help. Dangnabbit!
This post was brought to you by the letters B, H and G, and by the number 33  Arghf. It was a high of 33 degrees celsius today. I felt like I was back home in Singapore. Except, unfortunately, I do not have the luxury of entering my room to turn on the air-conditioning, because, well, golly gee, I don't have one!  It's sweltering, the heat is intoxicating, stifling, almost as if yr baking in an oven. Even the fan that rotates near your face does not provide a reprieve, except to blast dusty air into your stuffed right nostril (I've got a bit of the flu at the moment). Sigh.  So the nap I took in the afternoon, or rather evening  - woke up about 8pm (and there was still sunlight - I tell you...I'll never get used to this) - left me feeling groggy and more tired than I was before. I can only describe the feeling in one word: bleuuurghghhffffgg. I felt extremely bleuuurghghhffffgg.   And the next coupla days promise to be worse. It's rollercoasting up and down, from 23 tomorrow, to 33 the day after, to 19 the day after that, to 23 on Thursday again. Wah lau eh.... well, weather predictions change on a daily basis, so maybe it wouldn't be that bad.   I can only hope.
Birthday Part Deaux  Yup, yesterday went well, although the picnic at the beach became a picnic behind the bathhouses 'coz the wind was so strong. It was nice and sunny at Mid Brighton Beach, but way too windy. Overall, it was fabulously delicious, I got some nice piccies of the colourful bathhouses that looked like they could only fit 2 human beings plus their pet turtles - ie. very squishy n small.  Oooh we went to Hunter Gatherer at Acland Street, St. Kilda and picked up a really nice skirt for about $19. Kewl eh? Charles says it makes me look like Jungle Girl, ah but what da hey, you only turn 23 once.   Sigh...23...soon it'll be 25, then 30. How life zooms past. Ever get the feeling?  Anyways, for dinner, EG brought me to this v. nice restaurant by the bay/beach in Williamstown, called Anchorage Restaurant. I had the Sirloin, he had the Eye fillet, even though that place was more of a seafood kinda joint. We ordered the only 2 steaks on the menu. By boy, delicious! And the company was good, although it strayed to topics like 'Is it possible to make drunken fries? Or like flambe it or something...', to which we started enacting how we'd do it, like  (cup hands together)  here's a potato,  (jerk arm as if adding seasoning)  add wine, followed by  (flick thumb as if lighting a cigarette)  lighting it, and then  (move hands together quickly as if imitating a fire that goes fooooooooom)  TA DAAA!!!'  10 mins later....  EG: 'Hey, what are those?' Me: (Chewing a rather large piece of medium-rare steak...)  Cup hands together, jerk arm as if adding seasoning, flick thumb as if lighting a cigarette, move hands together quickly as if imitating a fire that goes fooooooooom  EG: 'Potatoes?' Me:  Excitedly pointing left index finger to nose, and right index finger to EG, nodding vigrously, cheeks full of food   The highlight?  EG: 'Eh? You don't want the mushroom ah?' Me: 'Mushroom? What mushroom?' EG: 'Er...that.' Me: 'It's a mushroom? Oh my goodness! I thought it was a really burnt slice of potato! Like, flambe-d or something!'  Yes, my blonde roots were showing.  My parents called later, to wish me a Happy Birthday, as well as my sis this morning. Tho Thweet. And Bart too, half and hour ago (Note to Bart: It's OK!! I still love you! :-) )  How does it feel to turn 23? I really don't know. Ask me again the same day next year.
Shameless Plug  It's my Birthday today! woohoo! Was born 23 years ago, at 1.41pm (GMT +8hrs - i.e.S'pore time).  So far I've gotten a really cool laptop backpack for my luverly iBook from EG, Charles and Wally, and very adorable Sabi underwear from Bel. It's blue striped with a goldfish in front - she was very excited about it hehe. (Although Charles insists it isn't a goldfish, it's just a fish that's orange-gold in colour. Looking at it, yeah, maybe, but me and Bel will insist it is a goldfish! For my (name)sake!)  We're going for a picnic at Brighton Beach later, and a nice dinner, just me n EG later tonight. Can't wait.   How we decided on Brighton Beach was really amazing! We were scratching our heads as to where to go for a nice picnic. So I thot, hmm, somwhere not too far out, but still away from the city. Maybe a beach, or the countryside. Figured, hey, we've passed Brighton beach a coupla times on our way to Ikea in Moorabin, why not give it a go? I still wasn't sure though...  Then EG came home, so I asked him, 'Where should we go?'  'How about Brighton Beach?' I stared at him, while scrambling to find in my brain whether i'd mention the location to him earlier on the phone or icq or something. Nope-didn't.  'You're kidding! I thot of it too! Oh my gosh!' 'Yeah, Shawn's been there once, siad it was pretty good.' 'Oh my gosh! It's a sign I tell you! I even asked Evie about it just now. Maybe God wants us to be there or something...heheh'  Hmm..maybe he does? We'll see. It's amazing how excited I get about the lil' things in life...very easily amused hehe...  Okely dokelies. Will let ya all know what happens next!
The things she said...  'Did you know that how you hold your chopsticks means how far away your future partner is?'  'Did you know that you can eat the fish's bones? If they're fried enough.'   (Qn: 'Which part of Singapore are you from?')   'Oh, Singapore isn't very big, it's actually smaller than Victoria...we don't really have states.'  Yes, yes, such are the pearls of wisdom that spewed from my mouth at an alarming rate at the staff meeting. I really hope people didn't leave thinking 'god, that weird Chinese girl talks waaaay too much'.  'Coz that's what I think I did. Left people with bits of information that they didn't really want to know. Sigh.  On the up side, I think overall it went pretty well. The other staff pple were nice, and so was the meal, at Kun Ming Restaurant at Lt. Bourke St. It's been there for ages apparently, and got a huge do-up recently, leaving it looking pretty posh. Other than my inanities, it was mostly coffee talk.  I don't think I'll get as many hours as I'd like to work, judging by the training schedule. So won't make as much I guess. But I have a good vibe about the job...the boss, the pple, the place, the uniforms (which me Boss has to re-order 'coz they were a lil' too big). They're also pretty strict about attire - no earrings, minimal jewellry etc. Oh wells, not that I have any outstanding piercings anyways...And praise God, the job's starting 1 week later than scheduled, on Dec 9, so that means I get to go Church Camp! Woopee! (woopee mostly 'coz I get to surf hehe....)  Anyways, those were the highlights. Hope things work out with colleagues! And I gotta study for a Gloria Jeans' exam regarding coffees and the machines etc. Lotsa things to do...and remember. Like 'once a customer enters a store, how soon must you greet him/her?' Answer: within 8 seconds....oooohhhh.....  That's what I'm talking about...

Bow down to the Red Dragon!...   To paraphrase Ray Fiennes. Just returned from the movie - it wasn't too bad, albeit a lil' predictable towards the end. Does anyone know if the ending was the same as the book? Kenneth believes its different - shan't say more or I'll be accused of being a 'spoiler'.  Anyways, just thot some areas could be developed more, like the relationship between Reba and Francis (aka Mr D. aka Red Dragon aka Psychotically Repressed And Emotionally Abused Serial Killer). Stellar performance from Mr. Hopkins . Wasn't much space for Edward Norton to strut his stuff though. Same goes for Ray Fiennes. Emily Watson was very convincing as Reba, the blinking kewpie doll.   That aside, I also went to Borders and almost bought a book - 'White Teeth' by Zadie Smith (was it Smith?), although was stopped at the last minute by Shawn who said it sucked. He said he was willing to give me his copy, which was back in Singapore though. Damn...  I spent a good 20 mins trying to finish reading  the Glamour mag that I'd started the last time I was at Borders. At $11 a pop, I don't have the moola to spend on buying imported mags, so it's Border's free browsing for me. Never got to the last page, but did read an interesting article by Kristen Gore Schiff (Al and Tipper's daughter btw) regarding women, work and motherhood, and why can't women have it all without compromise. I'll prob. read it again, to relook at the fine points she brought up. Did you know that Australia and America are the only two developed countries which have UNPAID maternity leave? tsk tsk....UK has 18 days while Hungary has 24!  A couple months back there was a huge hoo-haa regarding a bill that a women's coalition was trying to pass, that they get to have up to 3 years maternity leave. Some said it wasn't economical to keep a woman at the company and have her retrained when she returned. Me? I'm not quite sure where my stand is, 'coz I don't enough about the properties of the bill, nor do I know how much maternity is enough, nor do I know what the so-called economic costs are. So, gotta find out so I can weigh out the costs, and see where I stand.  I do believe, however, that the company she works for should be supportive, and allow her enough time to spend with her child, and not penalise her in monetary terms. In short, motherhood/household maintenance etc. is work!   I wonder if anyone's written a thesis about the whole leave-the-nursing-to-the-maids issue in Asia. How does that affect a woman's stand and her power relations with men and other women? Other than the gender issue, it also becomes somewhat of a class issue too.  Any thots? Leave a bl00p!

Would you like boobs with that?  I really really can't stand Jennifer Love Hewitt. Or else, intensely dislike, whichever way you take it.  Sitting here in front of the computer, listening to the whinge-rock that is 'Bare Naked' for the gazillion-millionth to the power of Nth time, all I can think to myself is,  'god, I hate Jennifer Love Hewitt!'. Or Intensely Dislike.  How can anyone not stand someone who tries to rip off another singer's moniker? For goodness sake, J.Love? Holy moly ron kenoly!  And the Party of Five days, and Can't Hardly Wait, and her bobbly breasts, and her puppy pouts.   Ask me about the Jennifer Love frown-pout the next time you bump into me.  Would you like boobs with that?          Ironically after I wrote this post, I got into Sue-Lee's car, and there, blaring on Nova 100, was, you guessed it thaaaat song. It was as if the planets had specifically aligned today, to add salt to my bare naked wound, to rub my nose into Jennifer Love's perky bosom, for daring to take her pouty highness' name in vain. Sigh...
Epitaph  Picture a quiet graveyard in the long-distant future, with craggly grey stones, the smell of green green grass, the trees overhanging as the sun streams through in the fading twilight. You stroll among the chirping birds, the flittering dragonflies, the people walking their dogs amidst the calm serenity.    Then you stop at my tombstone, and etched into the granite are words of wisdom that will follow you eternally.    I CAN'T REPLY TO THAT BECAUSE I AM DEAD.   Aaahhh...a cryptic message from beyond the grave, yet quirky enough to embody my character, my nature, my innate...er...quirkiness.   Whatever you say,   I can't reply to that because I am dead .    (Had meant to write this entry for a while now, dunno why I forgot to. Ami's blog entry reminded me of it, not to bear any disrespect to her entry of course, hehe).
At Last...  It's over. The whole bleedin' ordeal. The whole  shebang . Essay garble on dominant ideologies perpetuated via melodramatic forms on television such as the soap opera and even my fav. tv show of the moment,   24 , due to their associations with the domestic sphere and the lack of final resolution. Essay crap on how  Looking for Alibrandi  can be constituted as part of Italian National Cinema even though the entire film is set and shot in Sydney, Australia. Essay vomit on Omar Calabrese's ideas of television seriality and the five dominant prototypes. Essay blobs on the uses of comparative advertising. You get the idea.  I AM FREE!!!  At least for the next 3 months plus. Until it all starts again in March.  But in the meantime, I'm gonna enjoy my freedom. Oh what to do what to do...hmm, yes shopping of course! Especially since I GOT THE JOB!!!  Wooohooo, yes yes, it's just at the new Gloria Jean's outlet, a global franchisee of coffee in Melbourne, the heart of Australian coffee-making. As Shawn puts it, I've sold out. But what the 'ell. I've got a job that'll last through next semester (if things go well). Praise the Lord!   Austin Powers impersonation: Moola moola moola...   And, based on the fact that I'm turning 23 next week (*ahem ahem hint hint*), I'll be paid a higher wage than most others (it's Award Rates over here, so the older you are the higher the pay. Downside tho's that some pple won't hire you, knowing they have to fork out more). Even after tax (which I can claim back anyway), I'll still be taking back a pretty decent wage. Woohoo!  Well, they say good things come in threes. I'm just waiting for the third. Hmmmm....
Have you ever?  I'm just wondering is it just me or does everyone sorta put on an accent when they speak with  ang mohs ?  After years of thinking such people as   le poseur , I've come to the conclusion that we can't help but do so as a natural human effort to communicate with others clearly. I.e. if we speak a lil' like 'em, they'll understand us a whole lot betta.  Case in point: A couple of weeks ago I was checking around for prices for belly-piercing - Bel wanted to give it a go, so I was sourcing for the costs. Ended up calling this guy, who turned out to be a pharmacist who did all sorta piercings for pple, along with his wife who was a doctor (hygiene!). I rang up, and somehow ended up with a twang as I spoke. This usually pops up when I'm a lil' nervous too - lapsing into my Valley girl mode.   Hi, I'm just wondering if you guys like, do belly-piercing?    Yep, we sure do.     Oh, how much does it cah-st?    Well, it's $75, but it's pretty cheap. You sound like you're from America.   Momentararily caught off-guard, I said the first thing that popped into my head to explain the accent.   Uh, yeah, I am.    Oh, which part?    Sawrry?    I mean where are you from?    Erm, America? But I'm in Melbourne now....    Oh, erm, er, that's all right, heh. I was trained in San Francisco myself, so I know that you're getting a good price here. Are you a Melbourne Uni student?     Erm yeah, I'm an...exchange student.    Well, Melbourne Uni students get a discount, so that's about (calculate calculate calculate) $63.    Oh cool, ok. Yeah so if I decide to make an appointment I'll ring you guys yeah? Thanksverymuchseeyabyebye.   Dooooot....doooooot....doooot......    Sheesh kabab.... If anyone else has done silly stuff like this, please let me know so I don't feel so alone in this world... ;-)  4 November 2002
Emily of Emerald Hill  Impressions of the lady sitting 2 rows behind us:   Emily (played by Ivan Heng)  says something  Lady behind us : Mmmmmm.....  Emily  says something else  Lady behind us : Mmmmmm....  Emily  asks everyone if they know the recipe for Pineapple Tarts  Lady behind us : Pineapple, sugar, er, mmmmm......  It was excruciating.  Other than that, the play was hilarious and Ivan Heng was great as everyone's favourite Peranakan Bibik. Especially when Emily started interacting with the audience, and pulled this woman on stage as she was getting to her seat (she was late - thank God we got to the theatre just as they were closing the doors). Made her stand in the corner while everyone laughed, but the woman was laughing too, and enjoying herself. She was finally allowed to return to her seat though, after apologising to the 'class'.   Should've been the lady sitting behind me. Mmmmm......
Countdowns  It is...  4 days 'till Big Jon's birthday 7 days 'till essays end 9 days 'till Charles' birthday 14 days 'till mine 28 days 'till the Bic Runga concert (of which I still have to purchase the tix) 54 days 'till Christmas.  Hmm..what else is there to look forward to?
Does everybody know what time it is?  It's...tool time. No seriously, it's 4.30pm here and I haven't gotten started on the rest of my essays. I just wish everything'll get done soon. Essay time of course, also means that my room and bed got vacuumed, the toilet got scrubbed, and the hallway got vacuumed as well. Essay time = housework time. Oh the life of a procrastinator...  Btw,  urlLink dooce.com  is back! Hooray...haven't had time to run through the archives though, but the stuff I've read so far's pretty good as usual. Very Ami, but more acid and bite. (That's not too say that Ami's doesn't have bite...noooo....in fact, the girl literally bites. EG had her teeth imprints on his leg for awhile ;-) ).  I hate Daylight Savings time for the fact that I lose an hour in Spring. So last Sunday, spent turning my clock forward, I lamented over the fact that I have even less time to do my essays. Eurgh.  I should get back to work...Sigh...v.v.bored...
Also...  Note to self: Never EVER EVER talk about toilet paper that scratches your bum, over the phone, while sitting on the steps in a semi-unladylike manner.  You never know who could walk by and listen in on the latter part of the conversation and not realise that you were talking about ways to save money.  That same person may also throw you a look that's a cross between disgust and confusion before rerouting their path past you.
Altogether now...It's quite fun to be a Mamasan...  It's quite fun to be a Mamasan! It's quite fun to be a Mamasan!  Hehe, yep being the innkeeper at the Lucky Lucky Best Best Holiday Inn in Bethlehem has its advantages :-) Whatever it is, portraying a loud brusque  sampat  brothel owner at which the baby Jesus was born proved quite a risque performance at tonight's church Christmas dinner. But it went down pretty well, everyone laughed, and I kept having the aunties and uncles coming up to me and patting me on the back for being such a good actor heeeheee...although some people say it wasn't really acting, I was just being myself. I wonder what they meant by that...hmmm.... :-)  People laughed at unexpected bits too, and especially at the last part where I started coming on to one of the Three Wise Men. Speaking of which, their rendition of 'Dancing Kings' to Abba's tune was an instant hit, coupled with Steven's portrayal of a not-so-wise man bumbling around in his jester hat. It was priceless, to say the least! Also spot-on was Uncle Jimmy's Angel Gabriel, complete with flapping arms substituting as wings, and a lab coat. 'Remember Joseph, what Mary says is true, for women are ALWAYS right!! Ask the married men in the audience!'  Aaaah....the wisdom of an angel.  Special Mention goes to Emily's and Amy's graceful dance, who pulled in the serious note of the play. Sigh, it's just as well that I was  Mamasan and not one of the dancers lah - would've probably fallen flat on my face. Teetering on high heels are fine, but swishing and turning and curving around to a ballad? I'll leave that to the professionals.
And the Results are...  Yippee, didn't do too badly for my essays, better than I expected, considering all the last minute work I did hehe. Praise God it all turned out fine...  Yesterday night was a movie marathon as I spent a couple hours under the star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens, watching Y Tu Mama Tambien as part of the Moonlight Cinema festival. The festival runs for about 3 1/2 months till mid March, with screenings of shows like Grease, or Frida or My Big Fat Greek Wedding - basically an eclectic mix of shows, and even Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers as the festival closer.  Following the nice picnic under the star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens, EG and I joined Charles, Alan and Shawn watching double-o-seven on the big screen at 12.45 am - explosions and diamonds for everybody! I have to admit though, the film's storyline was slightly more interesting than the bland catch-me-if-you-can scenario played out in the last, what, 19 or 20 Bond flicks? This time, he's Renegade! (And the Lorenzo Lamas/ Robinson Crusoe look does become him somewhat, although, Pierce baby, you gotta work at those abs! I spy some double-o flab...)  Recommendations: Lying on a mat under a star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens accompanied by good food, hot chocolate, a blanket and a warm hug. Yumsss...
Pedal to the Metal  Had my first driving lesson with EG today, at a quiet carpark in Kensington. It was awesome! Had lotsa fun, even though it took me awhile to get the hang out changing gears, releasing the clutch etc. EG said I did pretty well for my 1st lesson, and that I caught on quickly. Hehe - he's a real good teacher actually, encouraging and patient..awwww.....  So I could start all right. The only problem was stopping! Hahaha....took me a long while to get the hang of braking and coming to a gentle stop for some reason. In time...  In other news, I'm playing the mama-san of the inn where Mary and Joseph crash at for the night in our church's Christmas play, held next Saturday. Quite funny lah, me teetering around acting like a Cruella Deville / ham-sap middle-aged lady. I think my favourite line would be when I say to Joseph 'Aiyoh...leng zai (handsome boy)...' and pinch his cheeks. (Either that or 'Welcome to Mamasan's Lucky Lucky Best Best Holiday Inn! How can I halpchoo?')  EG's flying back next Sunday...we'll be seperated for about 6 weeks! I'll definitely miss him, n i think it's about the longest we'll be seperated for (or was the Hawaii stint longer?), though it'll also be good to have some time apart and regroup. :-)  How's everyone doing btw? (Yes, this means YOU, the reader of this fair blog...)
Whoosh  Ever felt the rush of wind against your ears as you take hairpin turns at breakneck speed? Yep, just did it - paid 60 buckaroos to whirl around a go-kart track for 1 hour.  I left thinking, 'Man, I'm such a wuss!' and how I didn't get my money's worth for the 3 runs round the track (Australian Grand Prix rules), 'coz I didn't overtake and cut corners as much as I should've. Next time, I will. But dammit, I was afraid of crashing, and my arms were really tired from turning - really had to use my arm strength. Added to that I'd injured the middle finger on my right hand just minutes before the race playing air hockey. Sigh - the injuries from my go-karting expedition happened b4 the race'd even started!  But going at pedel-to-the-metal speed on the straightest part of the track was such a scary experience. Some people call it a speed rush; me, I call it time to pray. I think it was scary 'coz the turns came up too soon - didn't get to enjpy the speed of that stretch b4 having to tap the brakes and make the turn without skidding. And when someone crashed into me, boy was it painful - lurched forward in my seat.   I hate having other drivers really tagging close to me too - so I just give way. See? Whadda wuss haha.... :-) I guess that'll make me a semi-safe driver in real life (which reminds me, EG's supposed to teach me next week. Woohoo!) Anyways, I think I'll try the other track up in Sunshine soon - the Port Melbourne one, in a converted warehouse, just seems too small. Oh, and with a smaller group, so I don't have to keep slowing down when the amber lights start flashing 'coz someone's just crashed.
Camp  Phew! Just camp back from Camp. Awesome experience! Will Blog more tomorrow - too tired....
Lord of the (Bathtub) Rings: The Two Showers  Congratulate me, people. Today is the inaugural start of taking two showers a day, a feat never before accomplished by yours truly since arriving in Melbourne. That's because the weather's always been pretty good. Even summer - balmy and warm.  Today, it was gluggy, and HOT. It's 1.24am now, and it's 30 degrees outside! EURK!!!! Dang forest fires and depleting ozone layer. Dang-hot-diggity-dog. It's HOT.   And it's worse tomorrow - 42 degrees!! I just wanna curl up and melt with the heat. But no, I shall press on, and leave the comfort of my home.... for the comfort of an air-conditioned shopping centre. I hope I find a good one.         Damn, it's hot.
Intense  That was the expression on Eminem's face in 8 Mile. Either that or Intense-stoned. The only 2 expressions captured on camera thoughout the movie. Oh yeah, and when he gets pissed off - then that's Beat-the-shit-outta-you-Intense.     Phew!  The pic was pretty all right - very character-driven, although it tended to drag a bit. Parts I liked? The scene where he raps/sings to 'Sweet Home Alabama', in his words of course. Also the touching couple of minutes when he's tucking his younger sis (or daughter? the movie's pretty vague about it) into bed and sings her to sleep. (Side note though; Emmy, baby, stick to da yo-ho-ho-rap n leave da singin' to da professionals, ya know what I'm sayin', bro?). Oh and the mandatory shag scene, I'd like to think, was thrown in for good measure just to prove a) he digs Britney Murphy's character, Alex,  b) to show how trite and meaningless sex is today, and c) just to please the bulk of the movie's audience made up of adolescents wanting to Be Like Em, who are up for some gratituous shots of flesh, esp. Murphy's (although let's not forget the scene where he flashes a piece of his lily-white ass to the audience as part of the Rap Battle Royale sequence at the end).  That said, with those intense close-ups of Emmy's face, I think he's actually kinda cute. Symmetrical features, piercing blue eyes. In fact, he could down right be a nice sweet ol' guy. He's a romantic, a passionate poet at heart, his melodic lyrics inspiring this shattered world to greater heights. Save for the parts where he wants to kill his ex-wife of course.
There's no such thing as a free lunch  But for Charles there is! 'Coz he was sweet enough to drive me all the way to Ardeer, which is majorly far away (although taking the M1 and West Gate Fwy cut the driving time considerably). It was past Sunshine. If I were to travel by bus, it'd have taken me forever - just think of travelling from Pasir Ris to Jurong and back, and there's only ONE bus that goes that way.  And why was I doing in Ardeer (formerly known as Deer Park West) anyways? 'Coz I was there to pick up my mobile phone, which had accidentally slipped out of my bag in the bus that morning, and ended up in the hands of a lil' ol' lady who didn't even know what it was! She popped it into her bag, and when she finally picked up the phone after I'd rung it countless times upon discovering its disappearance, I was overcome with joy. Praise God. What a miracle. Considering the fact that she had no idea how to operate a mobile phone.  After a long while trying to figure out where she lived (her English wasn't very good - I think she's Italian), and after calling Charles countless times, and after rearranging my meeting with Bridget, I was finally off to Ardeer to meet this lovely angel who rescued my blood-line, my mobile phone. Where all my contacts (and the free pass-SMS to 'Chicago') were stored.   Mac opened the gate and returned the phone to me, to which I gave her an impulsive hug, so relieved I was. Phew. That's almost-losing my phone twice within a few months. I really have to get into the habit of looking behind me before I leave. Bugger.
Who am I, really?    And who am I, to You?

CNY just around the corner   Yep, it is. And I have many things to prepare for the church picnic that's going on then, on  chu er  specifically. Like source for goodies, and prepare flyers, and organise transportation. Many things to do!  But I guess it keeps me busy.  To my fiathful readers (yes, all 3 of you...), sorry I haven't been updating regularly, just been caught up with the daily grind of life (ironic seeing how Gloria Jean's slogan is 'Escape the daily grind' - geddit? coffee? grind? oh never mind...). So as you can tell, the blog's been a little anorexic. That and coupled with the fact there's really nothing much happening in my life now...doodeedoodeedoo...  Let's see, maybe I should change my writing style. Instead of a journal-esque what-happened-today kinda report, maybe I should just deliver quirky excerpts, or at least working harder at putting a spin to the events that unfold daily.  How's this for a change?  'Driving...euphorically exciting, especially the feeling of controlling a revving machine under my feet. A small tap and it roars, a release and it stalls. Machinery built for ease, yet deadly in so many ways. Can't wait till the next lesson. I love driving.'  Hmm...maybe I should just stick to my day job.
Ah hah!  So that's what  urlLink  they   do while the comp's on Sleep mode...  Courtesy of me  urlLink  sis' blog
Cruise Control  I had my first  paid  driving lesson today. Let's just say I'm starting with another instructor on Monday. 'Coz Sprint Driving School's instructor really sucks in the personality department.  He was this guy in his 30s, gruff, with curly hair, Nike sunglasses and Bunker shoes. Spoke with some pseudo-French accent, and was talking to me as if I were a small ant, nay, the food that ants eat. Harrumph.  So I'm going with Shawn's instructor. Was planning to do so, until he quoted me a slightly higher price - $27 for 45 mins, compared to Sprint's $25. So I figured, since Sprint's first lesson is $20, with a free one before the test, I'd just go for it, then decide. Sprint sucks. So I'll be meeting David and his late-model Toyota Corolla at the VicRds carpark on Monday.  Horns kept honking at me today as I took to the congested streets in the Southbank area. Never again! Eurgh... 'Phress youhr brahkes, hwhy youh afrhaid of phressing yourh brahkes?...Tuhrn here tuhrn left here...' while nary a smile cracked his  kwali -face veneer. Sigh.  Hope the next lesson goes better.
Bleepin' Fooo   *Parental Guidance advised. This post contains explicit language (which serves to highlight the reality of the situation).*  Today's rude awakening was brought to you by a scruffy pudgy jerk who wouldn't know his right hand from a can of VB if he didn't occasionally have to pick his nose.  There we were, standing on the curb waiting to cross the road like law-abiding pedestrians when a few jaywalkers crossed over to our side. Since there wasn't much room curbside with the crowd waiting for the lights to change, two of them had to squeeze past in the space between me and the shop that sold motorbikes on Elizabeth and A'Beckett.  The third brusqely shoved past me and bumped me aside, then had the audacity to blame me for not moving to accomodate his pudginess.  'Hey!' I said when I felt the push.   'Stupid fucking chink' he said at the same time, as he walked on.  I was stunned, then ranted to Shawn and Charles, 'What an asshole!'  Shawn shouted to the guy's retreating back 'Hey what's the matter with you?'  The Pudge turned around. 'She didn't move outta the way.'  'And that gives you the right to be rude? Have some manners, man' Shawn replied before turning around.  The Pudge advanced towards us enacting acts of bravado you see only on TV, spewing cliches less cornball than 'you wanna piece o' me', and more cheesy than 'bring it on'. Something more akin to the Far East Plaza bengs' call-to-arms of 'Settle!!' while flashing an orange comb with a pointy end.   Shawn turned around and faced him, once again reprimanding him for being rude, as the Pudge defended himself, eloquently stating 'So what?'  'Hey, you were the one that bumped into me ok?' I said. I was ignored.  There they were, two male peacocks in all their fiery glory, fighting for a piece of lost pride, jaws squared, looking at each other straight in the eye, the space between them the width of two fingers.  And I was thinking, where am I in all of this? This isn't some bullshit attention-seeking rant that I'm spouting here, but seriously, if he had a problem, didn't he have it with me as well? After all, wasn't I the stupid fucking chink that got into his Royal Pudginess' way? Did I need Shawn to defend my honour like a frail damsel in distress? Do I need to reminded, even now, that I would have slunk away muttering angrily before the shock of it wore off and I realised I should have retaliated? Or maybe I would have just turned the other cheek, saying I shouldn't bother or sink to their level (and used it as an excuse to hide my fear as I'm wont to do sometimes)?  Shawn just reminded me of the time at Priceline when this skinny bleached blonde teen just stepped on my heels and when I exclaimed 'Ow' she just told me to move my bags from the bench, and all I did was mutter 'Bitch' UNDER MY BREATH. He says we shouldn't let people like this get away with it.  So what should I do? I don't just go quietly, which I used to do last time; now at least I show my disapproval at others' rudeness. But what about setting an example? WWJD? Dammit, sometimes I know what I can do, maybe shout back a cheerful 'thank you for being so niiiice', and 'God loves you'  (and also just to unnerve them), but a scathing comeback's so much easier to take on than love and peace or even a conciliatory nod of 'whatever'. And maybe I just DON'T want to be nice or submissive. Maybe I want to fight my own battles, and show that I can hold my own against the Rude Ones, men or women (but especially men).  As the brilliant plumage of the peacocks began to fold back, Shawn decided to turn around and walk off leaving the Pudge to continue ranting, 'hey we can do this right now, man. Come on...' The Pudge just fudged his battle.  Charles asked what was it the guy had said that sparked the whole episode, and as Shawn replied, a young Aussie couple walking by us told us just to 'ignore that jerk. He doesn't know what he's talking about and unfortunately some Australians are just idiots. Not all of us like that'   We smiled, 'yeah, that's good to know. Thanks'. They smiled back, kindred spirits for awhile.  It takes all kinds, doesn't it? But what do I know? I'm the Other - a  Woman  of  Asian  descent, a small speck in this (post-colonialist patriarchal) world. [Forgive me for indulging in that piece of arty-farty knowledge hehe]  If my primary five teacher Mrs Koh were here, she'd have given him a stern talking to, and washed his mouth out with Dynamo for using such filthy language. That's what we need to keep the streets clean. A stout middle-aged aunty who could hold her own against the young punks of today.   Try calling  her  a stupid effin' chink.    5 January 2003
Happy New Year !!  From all of us here at Bloop Bloop! Inc., we would like to wish everybody a wonderful 2003, full of possibilities, cherished moments and blessings from the Lord!   God Bless everyone! :-)
Counting Crows  Dan Vickrey thinks I'm cool!  At least my hair anyways, says the lead guitarist of a truly fantastic gig on Tuesday. Too bad my seats were really crap and far up, although we managed to slip into some closer ones. Woohoo! Awesome gig.  Dan also said he wore a red shirt in honour of my favourite colour - was wearing red birkies, had a red bag, and red-streaked hair. Yeah roight, like his shirt was really for my benefit... :-)  Sigh too bad my birkies broke at the concert, and the Mrs Potato Head keychained to my bag lost her white hat. Oh the woes of a concert -goer...
Breathe yet again   Turning murmuring burning churning  Swirling gasping reeling frothing Pumping Blood, air, feeling, emotions Inside outside Won't it stop Please stop Please please stop  Now
Breathe again  I remember a shpiel I put up awhile back, which speaks infinite volumes about what I feel right now. It's my first shpiel in fact.  So now, once again, please rise for the encore performance of  Threat    This was it. She had no place to run, to hide. From beneath the folds of his trousers he produced his weapon, a shiny object that glinted and reflected the singular beam of light streaming through the window and THREATened her with it. Backed up against the wall, she had no choice but give in. She raised her hand as he slipped the object onto her finger, and accepted his marriage proposal...  Written by Sarah Wong, 4 June 2001    It's amazing how a year and a half on, your own words can come back to haunt you...
Total Request Live  Yep..I know...many people are asking for a full description of what happened that fateful day - Saturday, the 15th of February 2003 (also incidentally the 15th day of the Lunar New Year -  Yuan Xiao Jie  or the Chinese Valentine's day).  I promise details will be forthcoming! Been a little busy lately, with work and social activities. Plus I've been repeating the story so often my mouth has gone dry. Am a little tired of the story already! Eep.  Soon soon....in the meantime, hang tight! And thanks for all the congratulatory messages - it's been great hearing from u guys and knowing you're sharing in our joy :-)
Happy Birthday!!  That's what I should have said to the dear 6 year old kid who told me her birthday was yesterday. Instead I said, 'Oh! Congratulations!!'  Sheesh! It must've been all the 'congratulations' I'd been hearing all day, so much so I got my salutations mixed up. Eep. Every few moments, it'd be a person coming up to me at church, congratulating me, no, not for performing Herculean feats of magic, but for getting a proposal.  Yes dear Bl00p Bl00p readers, yes all 7 of u....I'M ENGAGED!!!  AHHHHHH!!!
Hair again  It's more or less faded now, so it isn't that orangey. Unfortunately the streak that I like on the front seems to have faded too. Not as dashing!  EG's family have arrived and are doing well, holed up at Oakford Mews, off Commercial Rd in South Yarra. Really looks quite new, very poshy and nice, serviced-apartments.   And Ethan is soooo adorable! He's only a year and a half, and he's already speaking and READING! and COUNTING! He can count to a hundred! And in multiples of two! And read Chinese words. And he knows the names of the authors who wrote his books, like 'Eric Hill' for his See Spot Run books etc. WOW. What a kid. And everytime he goes 'Aunty Sarah, Read' I just melt. What a guy. Cute, intelligent, and he smells so nice. Yummers.  EG got his new maroon Holden Vectra today. Not bad. Hehee...can't wait till I get to drive it around...muahahah...  Yeah..I guess that's more or less what's been happening. Haven't had much of a chance to blog 'coz been busy. Haven't even been on the Net all that often either! I really wanna get away for a weekend though, just to recoup and feel like I've actually had a holiday/vacation this summer, before school starts. And it's starting in 3 weeks! EURGH. SO not lookign forward to it. But it's the last leg. Shouldn't be too bad...
Hair today, gone tomorrow...  Hate my hair. Not the cut - love the cut. Just the colour. What was supposed to turn out as a pink block at the bottom of my wispyish chin-length bob turned into a chalky orangey-red mess.  And the best part was, I'd spent 1...2...3...4 and a half hours doing it!!!!!! Wah lau eh....  3 hours to bleach it, and it was still not white enough, but me and the stylist, a 17 year old sweet young student, decided we should just go ahead a try it. Then she had to mix up some colour 'coz they ran out of the one I wanted, and the teacher said the mix'll do. But combined with blondish hair, it came out less funky Pink and more Hong Kong Ah Lian.   What should I do now? Should I dye it all black (and maybe do a couple of red 20-minute streaks)? Or should I wait a week (as suggested by one of the supervisors) and bleach it again, then do the colour myself, using the Fudge range of semi-permanent colours?  Dammit....good thing it was only $32.10 for the cut and colour.
Darn...  EG's return has been pushed back another week, 'coz of problems with his visa approval. Something to do with the need for a police check 'coz he's stayed in Australia before. What a hassle...and the Oz High Comm in S'pore isn't really helpful at all. Plus they employ really grumpy women to front their counters and be rude to people applying for visas aka my boyfriend. Must be all that power going to their heads. Harrumph..if I was there....
Picnic  Wow, today's CNY picnic for church was a load off my mind. Praise God for the good weather, and everything went smoothly, and everyone had a good time. All the running around, blood, sweat and tears was worth it.  We had games - a group skits, CNY karaoke competition, and of course, a Lion Dance! Oh man, spent the whole night before sticking and layering the crepe paper onto cardboard boxes. Darn...what a waste.  If I had server space, I'd upload some photos so u guys can check out...but unfortunately...ah wells. But trust me, we had a lot of fun, and lots to eat, and everyone pretty much seemed to enjoy themselves, and we also had sparklers too! And lanterns...yes, even though lanterns are more for Mooncake/Lantern festival, but hey, it's still Chinese-y eh?  A funny story I heard today btw. A group of the people from church were in Chinatown, enjoying the festivities, when one of them got handed a booklet containing some facts and info about Asian businesses in Chinatown. She rejected it though, saying 'I'm not Asian!' under her breath. Thing is, she's Chinese! But she doesn't consider herself one I suppose. A couple of Aussies there heard it too, then smiled.  I wonder, why do 2nd-generation Asians sometimes deny their heritage? It's a whole issue I've been reading about for class, the diasporic community in a new homeland, and how the kids adjust being part of both worlds. About 95% of the people in my church are Asians, a good number being Aussie-born Asians. I wonder how they really see themselves; most don't speak Mandarin, some occasionally follow their parents to visit relatives back home in S'pore or M'sia, and a lot don't know a large part of their cultural heritage. Few of the Asian-Aussies turned up for the CNY picnic today - most were the Intn'l students, and the adults.  I guess now I'm beginning to appreciate and value the education I had growing up, being forced to learn Mandarin for 11 years ('O' and 'AO'-level Chinese). Some of it really sticks to your brain yah? I guess if I end up settling down in a country where my Mother Tongue isn't widely spoken, or part of the curriculum, I'd also send my kids to Chinese School, just to learn a bit of their heritage, language and culture, something extremely important (and marketable!) in this global age.   They can thank me for it later.
Dates  Happy Chinese New Year!! :-)  Had a great reunion dinner at Alan's place with his family - sob, so sad that I didn't get to spend it with mine. But they're only a phone call away....  Btw, did u guys notice that yesterday's date was 010203? hehehe cool huh?
Back home  EG flew back yesterday to settle some visa stuff, and praise God, he's got it down n settled, and it lasts till March 31st 2005. Woohooo!  I called me mum yesterday to talk, and yet again it turned into another session contemplating her worry over my brothers' future. Seems like the older one's acting up again, understandable seeing how he's going through the teenage angst years, but he's more difficult than she's imagined it to be, and she's worried over the company he's been mixing with, who've recently been caught shoplifting. Stealing for the Winona Ryder-esque thrill of it. And we're talking about a pack of rich spoilt boys from his school here. Bored rich kids who don't understand the value of money, who bandy about their fathers' wealth like a troupe of marauding monkeys, sucking up innocents who wish they could be like them, like my brother. Maybe I'm being judgemental here, but I honestly don't care, just wish my bro would wise up. Sigh, the  financial situation back home is really taking a toll on everyone.  I'm hoping to apply for a bursary from school to help with living expenses, at least till I graduate. I missed the boat on the rent one, which subsidises about $60 a week, but hopefully  there are others I can apply for. It's no-strings-attached, so prayerfully, that'll work out somewhat, to alleviate the financial burden on my parents.   It's quite pathetic how I keep running to God only when I'm in trouble or worried, however understandle it is, being a part of human nature. Yet sometimes I wish I could find the passion I once had about church and reading his Word, yet am bogged down by the mundaneness of life such that I can't find a reason to, or more appropriately face the inertia of picking up my Bible to read and meditate.  Although I see myself reaching out some way, in my little human form, for that vast expanse that is 'spirituality' and 'passion for God' yet coming up short most times.   Is it the engagement of the topic however? Does the deliverer of the sermon exist to entertain or educate? We (and I say we in the broadest sense 'coz I think most of us tune out once in awhile) learn when we're receptive and humour creates such an environment. How much then, do we learn when we switch off or don't connect with the speaker sometimes? But beside the Sunday agenda, there's more work to do to, on a daily basis, building such a close relationship, which to be honest, makes me wish I could have a proper conversation with God - as in hear audibly and see physically. Are real relationships based on this? The seeing and hearing and touching and feeling? The tangibility of the other?  Ah wells...back to my little worm hole I guess...
Numb  Today was a day spent waking up late, rushing to work at 7am (was supposed to be there at 6.30 only to be woken up by a piercing phone call at 6.45), rushing to school, going to bridge road, walking around hunting for a pair of good black shoes to wear to work and with jeans for winter 'coz the pair I'm wearing right now is literally falling apart, failing to do source said pair, going to Myer in the City, finding a good pair only to find out they'd sold out of the black one in my size (curse my status-quo size 7 feet), having the salesgirl call up all the Myer stores in Victoria, finally finding the LAST PAIR in the WHOLE of VICTORIA and thankfully not too far away, grateful for fiance for offering to drive me and my numb tired feet to Doncaster to pick it up, only to arrive at his office to sit about for one and a half hours waiting for said kind generous fiance to finish work and whisk me off to buy shoes.   Am still waiting.  Am also facing possibility that we might hang about Westfield Shopping Town in Doncaster for a bit, when all I want to do is go home, rest my tired aching feet and numb self, and watch a good night of sitcoms on Channel Seven. Oh curse late night suburban shopping centres....   Sleep...oh to sleep...perhaps to dream.   To paraphrase some famous person who said/wrote/sang that.    Bah Humbug.
Lola-post-loser  What is wrong with the archiving system on this blog?!! For the countless many times I've tried republishing my posts and tried to put up the archives again, it won't let me!!!  But the posts are still around, thank God, 'coz I can access them in my 'edit blog' mode, I just can't seem to link it up on my blog.   Can't the blog/Pyra people see this and help me? I mean, you've customised the banner ads to speak specifically to me, so I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING! What's up dudes? Can't you just show some tech support? I've followed your instructions in the FAQ section about republishing and how it's an indexing problem yada yada...and it's still not working!  Can someone out there reading this help me?
And now it's time for another Silly Song with Sarah!  I dance in my vagabond shoooooes.... Twirling and spinning till bluuuuuee.... I stop for a moment Catch my breath before it's stolen I feel my lunch coming ...it's puuuukke....   Thank you, thank you. I'll be here all week.
Today  Today's the day we got the keys to our new place! It's all nice and wet and green. The carpets freshly steam cleaned and damp. My new room smaller than I imagined.  Today's the day that I found out I don't need an extension after all - the due date for the assignment has been extended for all.  Today is the day I have to frantically pack the remains of my belongings, and prepare for a new phase in my life.  Today is the day I leave Evie and Chris and Jon and Sturt Street and great public transport behind. And say hello to Kensington and mediocre public transport.  Today is the day I have to start reading for my Understanding Australian Media presentation on Thursday.  Today is the day I can watch 24 on TV instead of taping it. I have missed many many episodes...didn't bother watching the tapes.  Today, today today....
Apologies  So here I am, facing a spectacular view  of Melbourne City, the sun reflecting a gold-yellow hue off parched walls and fresh concrete, perched on my comfy black office chair in the Law Library. A quiet spot this is. I really should be doing my work. Bah humbug - who really care's about Proppian narrative functions?  I'm sorry. Because you all can't enjoy this view with me right now.  So there they were, chatting and laughing and joking around, needlessly wasting time, indecisively deciding where to lunch. And there I was, waiting, playing watch-for-parking-attendants (which I hate), stressfully seeing the precious seconds tick by when I could be doing research, when I storm over in a cloud black debris.  I'm sorry. Because I was rude. Because I should control, not react, not express, but repress, and let it burn, and not take it out on you.  So there I was, thinking, culling worries, SARS, money, schoolwork, missing out on my brother's teenage years.  I'm sorry. Because I should be there for you guys, to watch and teach and motivate.  And here I am, sitting, facing a view, reading how I should write more.  I'm sorry. Should have entertained you earlier. But I'm back, at least for now, till my next disappearance.
Angst  My brother's acting up again.   Going thru' that whole teenage-rebellion phase.   I hope he wisens up soon, and stops hurting the people around him who love him the most.  I know it sounds patronising, but well, I am his older sis.  Sigh.  I hope he knows we love him.  Very much.  At all costs.
B'days  It's Miriam's b'day party today, and we're all going as pirates! The theme's 'Out of the Ocean' or something like that, heheh... it's really cool, I managed to scrounge up stuff last minute and put it all together. Used my red plum-coloured scarf as a pirate headscarf, and found a ribbon (in the exact same colour!) as my eye-patch. Matched it with one of my big hoop earrings (woohooo, finally a real use for it; Shawn's using the other one) and voila! Sarah the Pretty (sic) Princess Pirate!  As a prezzie, we got her a nice starfish pendant from Tiffany and Co., 'coz it's her 21st! Plus, she's leaving in July to go stay in the UK for a couple of months...sigh am really gonna miss her.  Miri, I'd just like to say, I Love You! :-)
Here comes another lunatic  Praise God, I passed my driving test! I'm now on my P-plates! Wooohoooo!  I'm gonna miss David, my instructor. He's really the best. Patient and fatherly. Sigh.  I have my P's!!!!!!
A Tribute to my Father  I will always remember my dad as a strong man, with shoulders broad enough for six-year-old me to perch on; he with the round tummy, a twitch in his moustache, and a twinkle in his eye.  I remember the times us kids spent in the queen-sized bed he shared with Mum, playing 'I Spy with my Little Eye' as he picked out easy items within plain sight, while we picked out items that couldn't possibly be hard to guess, yet he humoured us, and tried multiple times before we laughingly yelled out 'No Pa! It's the TV lah!'  I remember how he used to purse his lips together whenever he got mad, a stern warning to stop being naughty before he brandished the dreaded cane. But I also remember how he restrained from lashing out when he saw my terrible A-level results, and how he tolerated my first serious boyfriend even though he knew that guy was never right for me. And how he embraced the next, now my fiance, into the warm folds of our family.  For all this, I say, Thank You Dad, for being the head of our household, for being inspiring and uplifting, for being the earthly image of our Father up above. Thank you for caring, thank you for loving, and thank you for leading me in my life. God bless, and I love you.
Geez Louise  What are some of the most annoying Americanisms you've heard of?  I'll start with mine:  1. Geez Louise 2. Holy Canoly 3. Jeepers Creepers 4. Heebie Jeebies 5. Hubba Bubba   And must they all RHYME??!!
Discovery  3 reasons why my dad's awesome:  1. He's always cheery. 2. He loves me. 3. He can't stand watching a camel being mauled on the Discovery channel because, quote unquote, 'It's scary, and I don't like sad endings'.  It's nice to see that despite 54 years of life spent on this world, he remains refreshingly innocent.  It's more than I can say for myself heh.
Apathy  Read about this true life horrendous right-before-your-eyes case that my friend  urlLink Chuckie  witnessed.  Did you know the first thing they teach in rape-prevention class is NOT to scream for help when you're attacked? 'Coz most people would turn away to avoid confrontation!! (Read that recently in a  urlLink Reader's Digest  article).   How horrible is that?!!
More on Flashmobs...  A  urlLink thought-provoking piece .   Flashmobs: Political or Apolitical? Nonsensical or A-nonsensical? (heh)  You decide.
'Participatory Urban Street Theatre'  Read about the  urlLink Melbourne Flashmob  that congregated last Thursday (which I really wanted to be a part of but couldn't 'coz I was still stuck in Singapore...)
Barcode Yourself  Chanced upon this website, and the guy makes really interesting art out of barcodes. Like you see a photo of a person's face, and you put your nose right up to it and realise,  hey, this picture is made up of small barcodes! . How cool is that?  Anyways, I barcoded myself. I am, in our Matrix-ey world of Neos and Trinitys and Zions and what-nots, am humbly number  0 23003 64121 0 .  What  urlLink barcode  are you?
Illustrations  While at  urlLink Brennie's  site, I came across  urlLink this   one.   If you have time, check both out. They're extremely extremely talented illustrators (the former more than the other, I believe, but I'm biased hehe...), and I really enjoy thier work!  Brennie: I LOVEEEE the  urlLink shampoo  one. It's hilarious! I really like  urlLink sundress  and  urlLink jammies  too!
Intuition is...  1. Jewel's latest hit single 2. What I used when smashing the bloodsucking mosquito that landed on my computer screen. 3. What is required when navigating a stretch of road while various family members simultaneously scream into your ears to  both  'turn LEFT!' AND 'U-turnnnn!!', which, might I add, is rather difficult considering we drive on the left side of the road.
Television History  Why?  Check  urlLink this  out!!  Wooohhoooohohohooooo.  And yes, Tess (the reporter) is my sis. Harhar...nepotism at its best.
Yo de lay hey hoooo   I wonder how many people actually still read my blog? I know I haven't been blogging much, so to calculate, I would have to say it's the number of people who actually know about this blog, coupled with the trajectory of minute comet fragments floating down from space after burning up in the atmosphere, multiplied by the incessant number of phone calls answered in the cinema by a loud 'ah, an zua? watching movie lah', divided by the intensity of Fear Factor contestants' projectile vomit after searching for objects in a tank full of live maggots WITH THEIR MOUTHS, which brings me to a grand total of...two, yes TWO people who read this blog regularly besides me.  Thank you, Charles and Tessa, who've left messages on my TagBoard. I will never forget this. Never.  As for the rest of the lot of you, may a thousand fleas from a camel's bottom infest your armpits!
Speaking of Reunions...  Went back to poly today to visit old mass comm lecturers. My, my what a week of meeting up with people! Yup, and word has spread among them that I'm getting married soon, so that was pretty quick.  All in all, it was pretty fun, shooting the breeze, catching up with mentors I haven't seen in yonks. Ziggy's the same, so's Des and Robin and Yi Ling. Wanted to catch up with Mrs Yeoh, but she was on course. Maybe I'll just pop by again another day.
My High School Reunion  Am meeting a couple of former classmates from my JC days. My goodness, I haven't seen them in ages. In like, 6 years! I'm not sure whether to feel nervous or just plain old....  That said, tomorrow nite at Embargo should be a good one. I haven't been there, mostly 'coz I've been away of course, and I'm not exactly the type you see raving up the clubbing scene.   So tell me, is it all right to feel that slight wee bit nervous at impressing former classmates whom you want to think that you are  a) beautiful b) witty and intelligent c) thin?  I think c) is pretty much cancelled out here. I'll try to work on the first two. Surgery anyone?
It's gettin' hot in here...  And even though it's raining and cloudy and stuff, it's still so hot and humid! Euch! I'm often left feeling like one of those little-known species of gnats u see on Nat Geo programmes - all sticky and slimy and occasionally expelling venom through my pores.  Growf. If only our country was fully air-conditioned inside AND out. Work'll be a breeze (pardon the pun!)
More flashmobbin'  Here's what happened at the  urlLink latest Melbourne Flashmob .  Join the discussion  urlLink here .
Am blogging 'coz Charles says I have to be faithful to my audience  Settling into a new role at work is a real challenge. I feel lost, often directionless when it comes to this new project. But it's wonderful at the same time, to have a job in such a dynamic, yet nurturing environment, that allows you to breathe life into and concentrate on your walk with God. Such a privilege - and I'm getting paid for it too! Yay!!!  It really brings home the lesson 'I'm Strong in your Weaknesses' (to paraphrase the verse). Praise God - He's been so good to me. I pray for inspiration, wisdom and guidance, and the discipline to carry my ideals through.   Is the world ready for the new Global Advance Network Coordinator?
Gagh  Am currently traumatised because:  1. I just saw a horrible Photoshop-ped picture of a breast that supposedly belongs to an anthropologist who's returned from Africa and contracted some sorta rash. Her nipple had a couple of holes in it with squirming larvae. 'Nuff said.   2. I was driving along Bukit Timah Road and was about to turn into a lane when my dad suddenly  grabbed ahold of the steering wheel  from the passenger seat 'coz he wanted me to go straight on instead. I nearly ended up in the ditch!! (NEVER EVER do that to the driver, not least an inexperienced one!!)  3. I'm returning to Melbourne tomorrow to start a new career.
Another 'ilarious encounter  Here's an excerpt from an email from my mum, who'd quote-unquote 'nearly 'pengsan' laughing after reading the grapefruit account (Sat 25 October's post):  ------------------------------------------------------- Hi Sweeties,   Read Sarah's blog linked to Bart's blog on the Grapefruit episode, I nearly 'peng-san' laughing. Good fun for the week.   Maybe share with you this one just heard from a visiting pastor from Malaysia.   Pastor Gan from Malaysia shared that some years back, he offered his home to shelter a village girl from Ipoh, who was an orphan. One day, she had some food particles stuck between her teeth and asked this pastor friend of mine what to do. Pastor Gan offered her a string of dental floss and taught her how to do it. She went into the bathroom and didn't come out till quite some time. Pastor then asked her did she floss out the food particle and she said yes. Then, handed the dental floss string back to Pastor and said 'I washed it many times already. Return to you.'  hahahhahaha...some ulu kampong girl....  Mummy....  -----------------------------------------------------   Disclaimer: 'ulu kampong girl' is not descriptive of all girls from Ipoh, nor the greater area of Western Malaysia...
Kaploink  Just some random thoughts  1. Congrats to Karen and Jon, for entering a period of courtship!! May God bless you in this journey of discovery together! 2. Terence and Brenda have decided to name their son Joel Ong Li En!! (and mind you, it's 'Jo-EL' not 'Jo'll'. El as in Hebrew for 'son'. In which case, shouldn't he be named 'Ter-El' or 'Bren-El' ?) 3. Feeling bloaty. I pity the people around me when the gas gets expelled, one way or another... 4. Living the righteous life, dying to self, living and serving the one true living God...... is DAMN hard!!! (pardon my french). And tho' I know it's worth it, the turmoil of making conscious right choices has turned my world upside down, on end. We're not called to lead the easy life, we're called for greater things, to be dynamic infusions that pervade humanistic, hedonistic society...to Live. And sometimes I just want to crawl under a rock and give in to the tempations that rock my world, that provide relief and not rest. To not think and just carry on in the doing of things.   Ay Caramba!  In other news, check out  urlLink this site . Conservatives, mind your manners.
*ROTFL*  Came across this via my friend Bart's livejournal.  It's the  urlLink most hilarious thing  I've read all week!!  hahahhahahah......
YAYYYYYYYY!!!    urlLink     What Finding Nemo Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
New Arrival  Terence and Brenda have a brand new baby boy!!   Wooppeedoo!  I hope they call him Reuben. He looks like a Reuben. A strong name, yet sorta cool.  Hey Reubs. Yo Reubs! Watcha doin' Reubs?  Mmmmmm.....  I don't think they got much sleep last night tho. Babies always wake up just when you're about to sleep. Hmm...am thinking of visiting them and the little one again. Ooh...plan to bring a prezzie tho. I've got a perfect one. hehe...  urlLink The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint Exupry!!   er...don't steal my idea, can?
New Silly Song ahead...  The sun's shing outside and I'm feeling strangely disconnected. Unintiated. Not feeling like doing any work but wanna just blughpz around.  That's my new word for the day.  blughpz.  'If you feel like a leach, just wanna go to the beach,  Just blughpz. If you move like a slug, just wanna settle on a rug, Just blughpz.  Just blughpz.  Just blughpz....'  Amen?
Halp...  There are just some days when you come off feeling inadequate, and often times, insignificant. Tuesdays are those for me, often times 'coz the Exec. team meetings are long and arduous, and whatever little I contribute seem of even lesser importance.   But that's just today. Most times, it's pretty all right, it's just that being surrounded by thinkers and visionaries and perpetuators of God's kingdom is pretty intimidating. Plus the fact that it starts at 8.30 in the morning and coupled with the sore lack of sleep the previous night for goodness-knows-what reason.  Sometimes I question my calling in this ministry, this field. Where do I truly fit in, in all of this, in the ever-changing environment that I've been planted in? A lot of issues on self-worth and -centredness get thrown up in the mix, and I have to keep reminding myself that there's a greater purpose involved and at stake. To be honest, the sore lack of sitting down and meditating on his Word and doing my devotions is probably a key cause of this. Need discipline!!  Ah wells, just a bit of a whinge s'all.
NEW SHPIEL!!!
Friends and friend-sters alike  I'm currently hooked on this whole  urlLink Friendster  business, and am unearthing friends and acquaintances from eons ago.  It's like Six Degrees of Seperation gone mad!  Currently, with my personal direct network of 23 friends, I'm linked to more than 140 000 people! How bizarre is that?  Although, I'd have to say, a friend did make a pertinent point. How many REAL friends have we made thru' this crazy machination? Or are we just content finding long-lost friends? Or is it the fun of bragging rights (hey, i have 245 friends and you only have 18!! How pathetic are  you ?)  So far the experience has been interesting. Hooking up and messaging ex-classmates and realising they know people whom I know too. Like a primary school mate who's  urlLink my sis'  colleague at SPH, and also a good friend's girlfriend's brother's girlfriend.   Oh, you get the picture.
Ick Icker Icky  What happens when u need to poop, burp, eat and fart all at the same time?  You're me for the afternoon, that's what.   And coupled with an intense pain that comes from gastritis, induced by hunger, plus the blockage of my large intestine due to a lack of bowel movements in the past few days, I'm NOT a pretty sight.  Just thought I'd add a little grossness into your reading material for the day... hehee....
Memememememme (sorta)  Check out  urlLink  sarahwong.com!    I've mentioned her before. She's a really good photographer. Took pics of Andrea Bocelli too!  sigh..wish i could take photos like that...
Jesus (Pop) Freak...  Came across  urlLink this article  via  urlLink Winnie's  xanga blog, and a whole lotta questions ran through my mind.  It throws up a lot of issues to do with the convergence of religion with mainstream pop culture, and the harkening of 'being the salt and light of the world' - to influence (rather than be influenced). In this case, who's influencing whom? Mass media or Christianity? Are we merely using whatever means necessary to reach today's jaded youth? To 'reclaim' popular culture? Or has popular culture claimed us? Is usurping pop culture a means to an end? But to what extent? Has it become a turn-off? Jesus can be cool, and he sure can be radical. But so what?  Any thoughts?
I feel it in my fingers...I feel it in my toes...  So sings glam-rock bad-boy has-been 'Billy Mack' in the opening sequence of 'Love Actually'.  And he sings it so, so well - the ol' geezer, gyrating to the rhythm. But he's not the only one to gyrate (or vibrate, or translate, or prostrate) in the movie, no. For 'tis the season to be jolly, and Love, Actually, packs a punch!  The movie was hilarious! Tho' the plot intricately weaving through various (love)-lives was predictably naff, understated British humour never ceases to make me laugh till my belly aches. I'd expect nothing less from Richard Curtis, the man who brought us Bridget Jones' Diary, Mr Bean, and the Black Adder series. (And yes, Rowan Atkinson does make a couple appearances).  Truth be told, the movie should really be titled 'Lust Actually', or 'Luff Actually'. It charts the fluff-luff lives of several characters in present-day Christmas season London. It's love-at-first-sight. Or love-and-sex-at-second-sight. And where it comes close to the true meaning of Love -  choosing  to love, each day, again and again, despite mistakes and close encounters with infidelity - it shies away, preferring to gloss over its painful reality in favour of the 'sweet pure agony of being  in  love'.  One of the perks the movie offers is the fact that you'd recognise most of the faces in the movie, including Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth (Bridget Jones'), Alan Rickman (the bad dude in Harry Potter), Kiera Knightley (Bend it like Beckham, Pirates of the Caribbean) and Hugh Grant as  (can you believe it?)  the British Prime Minister!!   Like i said, it was hilarious!  (Although I must say, Mr Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral can still charm the ladies with his foppish yet debonair ways...)  Look out for the cameos!
Ponder  I've just finished a book by Francine Rivers called 'And the Shofar Blew'. It's a very real, telling, tale of the lives lead by a Pastor and his wife, called to serve a local community when the church's pastor retires. The book weaves intricately, and into depth, of the anguish the wife faces as her marriage disintegrates while her husband presses forward in building his ministry, into growing a church that he hopes would please his dad, the respected leader of a well-known mega-church.  It's not a plot-driven book. The climax is almost predictable, and the pace tends to dawdle at times. But the attention to emotional detail is amazing, and you feel and cry and smile as the characters do, while facing their daily demons.   I expected to turn the last page and sigh with a breath of contentment, of longing, that the journey I'd begun had ended all too shortly. But surprisingly, it left me cold. A cool splash to wake me up, to alert me to the dangers of ambition getting in the way of ministry, of being blinded by personal goals with no regard for wise counsel. Are we building projects too fast, steamrolling whatever (or whoever) gets in the way of progress? Am I constantly listening to the Spirit's guidance? Is this what the Lord wants? These questions were whirring through my head as I finished the last chapter.  And I have no answers. Not yet anyways. And I'm glad for reading that book - not just due to its entertainment factor - but for the fact that it got me thinking. And to dwell on thoughts that challenge my approach to ministry, my calling (which may throw doubts in the face of faith - always an unpopular approach). To think of what I'm doing, and how it ties in with the Purpose of My life, and to think about why I choose to do what I do; why I work on the projects I do right now; whether I'm going along with the flow 'coz it's my job; do I truly believe what I say I should believe in for 2004?  Questions questions questions.   It's good, I think. At least I'm thinking, and not following along like a blind herded sheep. The answers, I believe, lie somewhere along the lines of dying to my Self - the Self that's lazy, unmotivated, procrastinating, happy to coast along with whatever life throws at me. And I  know  that's not how life should be; rolling with the punches, drifting from pleasure to pain and back again. There's more!  Wake up Sparky!!
Mother  My mum's coming on Monday morning! Yippeeee! Till the 18th, after my graduation.  In other news...really wondering if the journey to marriage is worth it. Sigh, the ups and downs of coupledome....sometimes i just wanna give in to my animalistic instinct and be self-indulgent. Be all drama-mama and fling something against the fall - usually the ring on my finger. Like some movie/soap opera.  Don't worry peeps. It's all in my head...just a bit of a whinge in the valley-lull of my life. I realise I whinge more on my blog rather than expound on the good things happening in my life. Hmmm..  Really feeling the change in taking an active role of leadership in the church. Even friends have pointed it out, although a part of me is still reluctant to accept that I have changed, and for the better too. I'm more passionate, more vocal, feeling the zest to be close to God. (Yet strangely hypocritical 'coz I havent' been reading my Bible or spending time praying as much as I should. And it's not for anyone's, or God's sake that I do it mind you, it's really for my own. Tsk...the angst of procrastination....)  To wit, I say, onward Christian soldier!

A little birdie told me...  Here's an email from my mum. Enjoy.   'Hi girls, Tell you something funny.....  Last Saturday, invited some old friends for CNY dinner including Egene's parents, Uncle Thomsas & Aunty Rosemary. Half way thru dinner, I tried to switch on the TV to watch the Chingay Procession 'live' but can't get it. I was asking them 'Hey, Chingay what time huh?'  Then, Uncle Tom and Auntie Rose started to look at their watches to tell me the current time.   One old friend shouted 'Oi, you asking your 'chingay' what is the time or you asking 'what time will be chingay be on?'   Then I realise Egene's parents thought I was calling to them as 'ching-gay' in Hokkien, which means 'in-laws'.  hahahah so funny...... Luv, MUm'   All I can say is, OH... MY... GAWD.....
Hi there   I know I should post something up, but am not quite sure what to say. Heh.  Post post blah blah blah....  So a quick recap:  1. Just returned from a whirlwind tour of Bangkok & Koh Samui, and HOME sweet HOME! 2. Now back in Melbourne, freezing in our cold 'summer' weather. 3. Over-indulged in CNY goodies over the past couple of weeks.  4. Gained extra kilos 'coz of said CNY goodies. 5. Does anyone know how to make  more  CNY goodies? 6. New roles at job. :) 7. Just watched Honey - am inspired once again (though not by the stilted acting) to 'shake my tailfeather'. 8. Thinking of taking dance class so I 'booty to the beat, 'yo' like Jessica Alba in Honey (and to lose said CNY kilos). 9. Thinking of volunteering at local campus radio station to 'get back into the game'. 10. Should really stop annoying habit of speaking in 'quotation marks'.  Also, I confess, in my MTV-fuelled madness while back home, I bought 'In The Zone' (simply because  I can  and  I like her ok? ). Needless to say, my friends have disowned me, my brothers loathe me, and my pet fish and I are no longer on speaking terms.  Sigh.   ;)
Am enjoying...   This has by far gotta be the best publicity effort we've seen in a while...babies and celebs, what'll they think of next?!   urlLink Who is that with Jeremy?
Silly Songs with Sarah  I'm not sure if I've ever shared my 'Wilbur' song with anyone via my blog, but I thought, heck, maybe I should entertain people once in awhile...   To the tune of Copacabana     His name was Wilbur He was a show-pig With that blue ribbon on his snout He was the one that was no doubt He was the winner! For all their dinners... Bring out the forks,  and the knives, and the plates, Because dear Wilbur...  bam bam bam  He's Christmas ham...   How didja like that? Didja didja  DIDJA ??!!
Thrills and Shpiels  I'm surprised  urlLink my other blog  is still around, considering I haven't updated it in ages!!  Enjoy.
Comparative Natures  Right after I blogged the last post, I took it upon myself to visit other bloggers' blogs - mostly friends from church.   Boy oh boy, have I got a lot of catching up to do, especially with this bunch of eloquent peeps we have. And all emerging from the woodork! They have a knack of turning the terribly mundane to something far more interesting! Very much like how my sis does, with  urlLink her blog  , which btw, is still one of my all-time fav. blog reads. Hmm, doesn't  quite  run in the family, if you know what I mean...  Ah wells, back to work! Seeya in a while.
Hmmm  Haven't blogged for a long time, primarily 'coz ive been caught up with work, plus I've been, well, er, lazy.   'Hi, my name is Sarah, and I'm a lazy blogger.' 'Hello, Sarah.'  Teeeheeee....  Also, if you're wondering, or waiting for me to say something new and exciting... erm, I will. Soon enough - be patient my young padawan. Provided I'm not being the lazy blogger that I am again....  Ack. It's too early in the morning.
Frustration Part 2  Wouldn't you know it. Just as I'd predicted aloud to Yuls - 'y'know what the funny thing will be? I start typing and he calls to say he's on his way...'  No prizes for guessing what happened next...
Frustration  I'm so frustrated! At the lack of productivity. At the hunger pangs caused by waiting...waiting...waiting...  I'm meant BE at Soony and Michy's for dinner right now, yet am stuck waiting for my ride to come, who's in turn, stuck at a meeting which should have been settled eons ago. The complications of starting a new business. Sheesh...  Ah wells. Yuli is heading down now to hand me some forms for data entry. Yippee. Am finally  doing  something...
Tag's Here  Sit straight. Now look to your right. Look at the section below 'About Me'.  TA DAAAAAH!!  You have just located the tag-board. Congratulations.  Now, on to fixing some sorta table with links, and tidying up the look in the side boxes...
Comments  Hmm, do u guys know there's a comments function? 'Coz i haven't figured out how to add the tagboard yet, so please reply using the 'comments' button below.  So far, the only comments I've gotten are...my mum's. Sigh, my biggest fan. Also, inadvertently, my biggest contributor:   Saz.....Mummy like yr new blog!  So refreshing!  So full of life...just like you.  So clean and green...so Singapore... Luv ya. Mum   So Singapore??!!
A Trip Down Memory Lane  Taking my own advice, I revisited the posts I'd written when I first started. I just realised I've been with Blogger for almost exactly TWO WHOLE YEARS now!!! Can ya believe it? hehehe....  Reading the trials and tribulations of uni life brought a smile to my lips teehee. And reminded me of the anguish of assignments etc, and having my  sacre bleau!!  iBook damaged. Those were the days.  Thankfully Azalea, my trusty iBook has served me well in the last 3 years. Only the battery's shot, 'coz of the 'overcharging' I did to her. Basically, Azalea functions more as a desktop rather than a laptop nowadays...but she's still pretty!  I think the new look has really inspired me to blog/write/journal again! It's amazing what a little greenery can do to jumpstart a floundering writing career!  Ok, ok. I reeeeeally need to go sleep now.  urlLink Alex  my man, I hear ya. Blogging is highly addictive, especially when one should be doing something else...
Man oh man  I really should be preparing for my 1 Timothy session/presentation at the meeting tomorrow arvo, but am hooked on blogging and shifting my template designs around. Oh, darnit! Wish I were more disciplined! (or at least know a little more about HTML!!  Where do I add my tagboard html in this new template?!!!)  Father, please give me fresh inspiration, wisdom, and discernment as I tackle the Pastoral Letters tomorrow!  (This really feels like I'm back in school, tackling last-minute homework. ACK!!)
How Do Ya Like It?  How do u like the new look? I like very much. Me so happy. Yay.  On a serious note, it'll take awhile to put in the shpiels and tagboard and the links I've had before, so bear with me. (On the plus side, my archives have returned!! YESH! You can now revisit posts of years gone by, and see my personal journey in Melbourne!!)  Anyways, if u have any comments on the new look, let me know - leave a comment! For the meantime, enjoy the scenery.
Coming soon  A new look will arrive. Am in the midst of choosing. Stay tuned.  Also, here're the rest of the lyrics for Wilbur! Introducing....Verse 2!!   To the tune of Copacabana    His name was Wilbur He was a show-pig With that blue ribbon on his snout He was the one that was no doubt He was the winner! For all their dinners... Bring out the forks,  and the knives, and the plates, Because dear Wilbur...  bam bam bam  He's Christmas ham...  (doo doo doo... he's Christmas haaaamm)    When he was chomped down They were still hungry They needed something added, more! Or they were walking out the door And then came cranberries Right for their tummies Juicy and sweet, they looked great,  such a treat, To go with Janice...  bam bam bam  Their pet turkey...  (doo doo doo... their pet turkeeeeey...)
Stay tuned  Just wanna let y'all know that the next verse of my silly song 'Wilbur' has been created! In a space of only 15 minutes at Mark Teo's b'day dinner/bunch time, in between the meal and cake-cutting (it was a challenge by the fellow bunch members) last week! *pat pat pat on the back* haha...  Am v. excited. Have gotten good reviews so far, and it's even inspired a cabaret-style performance idea, with life-sized props to illustrate the story, with Ellen (Philpott) and assorted backup singers/dancers in shiny costumes bobbing up and down, holding top hats and canes! Very showy, but what would you expect from a song to the tune of Copacabana?!  Imagine...a darkened theatre, a solitary spotlight focussed onstage, where a lone figure sits on a barstool, her head bowed down, capped by a black fedora. The tune plays over the sound system, and on cue, I pop my head up and start singing, softly at first, then louder and louder and joined in by the bopping chorus behind me, while the dancers carry the life-sized illustrations as they prance about on stage as the sounds cultimates to its dramatic climax and..and...and...  Phew!! Gotta get my head outta the clouds....

Hellos agains  I have so much to get done before the week/day's up, especially in terms of the Annual Dinner that I'm planning that's coming up. So much to get done! And so many people to liaise with.  Sometimes, I wonder if it's just easier to  NOT  work with people, especially when u have to push, cajole, beg to ask them to get things done. I hate doing it, hate being the middleman. I want the Vision to inspire people enough that they're clamouring to get it done, to support what we're planning, but those darn  exams  just get in the way!!  Planning a wedding, on the flipside, seems to generate much more excitement. Most people ar ecstatic to be invited to be part of the intimate undertakings of planning a wedding! And I fully understand why - it's like being a part of a secret sorority that creates something beautiful, and once-in-a-lifetime chance! And I'm so terribly honoured and grateful that my friends have jumped at the chance to assist and be a part of something that holds so much meaning to me.   I guess I just wish that that sort of excitement could be generated in everything I need help to do! Is it really how well I have to cast a Vision that'll inspire others to move out of their comfort zones? Sometimes even I don't want to move out of the zone myself, to do above and beyond what's just required of me. I mean it's not like I need/want others to do the tasks - but really the sense of delegation-as-empowerment. As in 'teach them how to fish, and they can fish for a lifetime', that kinda philosophy! (But of course, there are instances where my skills are sorely deprived in departments of creative design, graphics and layout, and I have to depend on others.)  As you can tell I'm ranting. Lord, I ask for wisdom and strength and calmness in times like these! Teach me to be more like you! Less Self, more You!!  Father, I need your supreme wisdom, patience and kindness to fill my every thought and deed. Let me not be so tired that I forget how to see others as images of You!
Just  what  are collared greens??!!  Tonight was spent, quite lovely in fact, in the presence of like individuals who enjoy the oftentimes eccentric humour shared intrinsically. Yes, we're all kooks. That's why our bunch's called 'Out of the Box'.  That aside, it was pretty fun to revisit the Veggietales 'King George and the Ducky',not least Larry's silly song on Barbara Manatee. BUt mostly, it was the time spent after that we engaged with the creative side of our minds as we prepared for our song-and-dance bunch item for the upcoming annual dinner.  In the words of Bob the Tomato, 'have we got a show for you!!'  Suffice to say, we're ripping off showtunes and putting our own words in it. They're songs that kids would appreciate I presume, not least for the fact they're composed by a bunch of adults with very kid-like mentalities. I can imagine the spiel: 'Bible characters come to life in this charming stage rendition of stories like you've never heard them before!' Cue spotlight as the cast emerges.  I'm lovin' it!
Brrr...it's cold in here...there must be some Torros in the atmosphere...  It's officially the start of Winter, and the chills are setting in.  Surprisingly though, today was still pretty warm. I guess 'coz it's only the 9th day of winter. Which also marks the 9th month mark of my term as an Intern at ACCF!!  (applause applause)   Today's BIG QUESTION:  What does it mean to live a life that's  adventurously expectant ?   Romans 8:15 [MSG]: The resurrection life you received from God is not a timid, grave-tending life. It's adventurously expectant, greeting God with a childlike, 'what's next, Papa'?   I guess for me, a life that's lived adventurously is one that's on the edge (however cliche that sounds!), built in faith. Expectancy calls for faith, calls for living beyond what we can see and often times beyond our means or capabilities. Adventurously - that's a call to be daring, to leave our comfort zones.  So today, I shall begin like this: I adventurously expect...  Post your adventurous expectancies, people! (in the comments section)
Hope you don't mind Bart...  Here's what my friend Bart's been up to lately which I think is ultra ultra cool  urlLink revamping his iBook!   Qn to Bart: Is the Friend's image a temporary solution or permanent? (Hope it's the former...hehe)
Dissociative Identity Disorder aka Multiple Personality Disorder aka (only by popular usage) Schizophrenia   A word can trigger off many emotions, and the consequent turmoil as the mind and spirit tries to grasp one that befits the occasion is...well...confusing. It's like playing word association, where each phrase conjures up an expanse of images and feelings and heightened senses.    These are the words for me: Aunty Yvonne CNY Angpow Chicken Wings Wedding Funeral Life Support Heart Lung Breath Cancer Crash Distant Close Love Home Tim Danny Adeline Daisy Telok Blangah Short hair Maternal Peace Heaven Love  I wonder if any of these memories are simply confabulations, stop-gaps to create a sense of connection, like I'm grasping bits of straw that inevitably slip through my weak fingers.   I don't know what to feel, and I'd gather most in my situation wouldn't as well. Sad, yes but yet, at times, not really. It's only when triggers appear, or when I'm not distracted by something else, work, people, church. Like I'm trying every emotion in the spectrum for size, to see how it fits. Do I grieve? Yes I guess, where the wracking sobs appear inexplicably, but not very long each time, and anyways, just what are the rules for the mourning process? So new, this is. So very new.  I wonder if my Grandma realises what's happened. And I wonder what that would trigger in her too - will she babble and smile, and greet familiar faces at the wake, not comprehending its significance? Or worse, understand the full painful  measure of the loss of a child?  Too many thoughts to ponder...
Embarking  In about an hour's time I'll be on my way to Flinders, in the Mornington Peninsula area for an overnight camp/retreat/intensive with the rest of the community. We're going to be Equipped in tools, teaching, and the bonds of friendship, this Weekend, to carry us through the tide and turmoil of an everchanging world.  I got a frantic SMS from my mum today, read it disbelievingly, then called her back immediately, only to hear the distress in her voice. She sounded like she'd be crying, and rightly so I suppose. We just found out my closest Aunt, on my Dad's side, has been declared (and I  HATE this word) brain-dead. Brain-dead. Almost a cliche. Like a sufficiently melodramatic phenomena constantly portrayed in a daytime soap opera or Channel 8 serial.  She's on life support right now, and I don't have the full details, but suffice to say, I'm shocked. I had no idea this was coming. Her cancer's been in remission for awhile, and I'd never known that she'd been in-and-out of the hospital over the last couple of months. This was sudden. Bringing up her name always conjured up images of love, warmth, and fantastic food that we'd always enjoy at her place during CNY. And though we only ever saw each other during my trips home in the Lunar New Year period, we've maintained a certain sense of closeness, I feel. I'd anticipated meeting up sometime during my trip back in December (even during CNY again if possible), or if not, at the wedding in April, but now...  I don't know what I feel. Close, yet distant. Worried, anxious, helpless, yet...not quite believing it. Not quite coming to terms. Maybe my mum's message was wrong. Maybe it was a 'she  might  be brain-dead' kinda thing - mum often leans towards theatrics, it run in my family.  We'll just have to wait and see. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully. Prayerfully. Uncomprehendingly.
Lull  Am suddenly filled with the depressive haze that assaults me in periodic moments.  After the high from learning and utilising my brain at the Rikk Watts seminar over the last couple of days, coupled with the social performance of maintaining friendships over a meal, I'm suddenly feeling really, really, for lack of a better word,  sian .  I suddenly feel like I'm being extremely unproductive. Lots to do - but it's all a blur of tasks that I'm not quite up to doing. It's all the planning I have to do - hate sitting at a desk, interacting with a voiceless machine, and trying to articulate the swim of thoughts and things-that-need-to-be-done in point form. Am expected to plan and strategise. but am neither equipped nor have the passion to do so! I totally dislike a desk-bound job.  And there's the praying meeting in an hour-and-a-half's time, which I don't feel like going to, yet don't wish to spend my night distracting myself with the meaningless void of watching TV or a movie. It's a waste of time, which I've always known, yet can't seem to tear myself from. Hence I've to put my foot down on that one right now. Which is why I'm going for the meeting. Altho' of course, a huge part is so I won't disappoint the people who expect me to be there - BUT! If that element serves to stop me from distracting myself with other meaningless objects, then so be it.  ARGH. The groans and pains of a growing Christian living in the POST-post-modern world. Blech.
Grandma  I was suddenly reminded of my grandma. Of the fraility of life. Of the lossness of memory, of being a prisoner of self, of the fading distance between the conscious mind and the unconscious one. The reminder served to halt all trains of thought and brought great, sobbing tears to my eyes. Will I see her when I return in December? Will she live long enough to celebrate my impending marriage? Will she be there, waiting on the front porch, smiling through the haze of her cloudy vision?  I wrote this in response, to that reminder:  'I'm crying at work. Sobbing in fact. Mostly due to the feeling of abject horror and loss, a total and overwhelming sense of helplessness, and guilt. Oh the guilt. That I can't even give her a hug when I most want to, that she has totally recessed from my conscious mind, only to turn up as a blip in my radar when her name is mentioned.  But yet I understand the passage of life, the frailty and fruitlessness of the achievements made in decades past, fading as distant drops in the misty horizon. Which is why I'm reminded once again, that I cannot live it the way most do, climbing, clawing, attaining and ultimately losing, everything. And I'm cheered, and conforted, by the fact that she's as much an eternal being as me and you; her body and mind will disappear, but her soul, bouyed by her faith and belief in her Saviour, will never cease to exist.'  To the person who reminded me, I hope you understand, too. Not because I seem to know the answer, and that this is the only answer, but it's my source of comfort and strength.  He  is. And will be.
Food Alert  Am reading a book Charles  lent to me called  Eat Chocolate, Drink Alcohol and Be Lean and Healthy  by Andrew Jobling.  Sounds impossible? Yeah it does to me too.  But catchy title aside, it's pointing out that nutritional dieting may not neccesarily mean a deprivation of all luscious food, great and holy. From the glimpses I've had, it's pointing out how moderation is key, understanding how your body works, and maintaining a healthy relationship with food to ensure quality life over YEARS. So that means a good balanced meal of protein, veggies, and YES! CARBS and FAT even! HAH! Take that, consumer marketing....No fads. Watching your Glycemic intake, eating smaller but more frequent meals, among other things. So bring on the chockkies, (just not as much tho'!) :-)  On another note, am also checking out this supposedly free weight-loss programme, also touting long term effects, by watching calories. Hmmm...  Oh well, we'll see how it goes. Don't worry folks, am not planning significant weight-loss, just wanna tone up and de-train myself from the unhealthy obsession with processed junk food (that's not just at Maccers but in your local supermarket too! Sob....). Am signing up with the Arrow gym too! Can ya believe it? Target date: by Yuli's wedding in December...
Every morning when I wake up I think, 'This, this is the day that I will go to bed early!'  I hate getting up in the morning.  I am so not a morning person that I am the anti-morning person.  If you talk to me as I am waking, I will growl at you, even if you are being ever so sweet and tying to gently rouse me.  I crave Saturdays when there are no waking up deadlines and sleep goes on and on and on.  But, somehow, and micraculously, after about 15-20 minutes on the weekdays, I begin to perk up, start making the coffee (thank God for coffee) and think that maybe I can make it through the day without vertically snoring.  I do end up making it through the day, but have to fight like hell not to take a nap in the afternoon.  The hours between 4-6 have become my nemisis.  The problem revolves around the fact that I stay up 'til about 12:30 or 1 everynight (I teach school so this is way late).  There is no real reason why I do this.  I am not writing a novel or developing photographs or even knitting an amazing sweater.  No, you can usually catch me doing, well, nothing I guess.  I can't acurately say what I do each night.  Sometimes I'm reading, sometimes watching TV, sometimes reading blogs online, and sometimes talking to west coast friends.  I used to actually stay up to watch Letterman, but TV bores me more and more lately.    I have always been a night owl.  I can't remember when I didn't like staying up late.  It must have started in late elmentary school or middle school when I can remember watching Saturday Night Live and Johnny Carson with my family (I know, quality bonding time).  I remember in college wishing that exams were given at night because my brain was just so much more alert then and I was convinced this would improve my grades.  I still 'wake up' at about 8pm everynight.  This is when I begin getting things done, the dishes, the laundry, the phone calls, the emails, the projects, the organizing.  About 2 hours into my second wind, I remember that I wanted to go to bed early so I don't feel like shit in the morning, but 10pm rolls around and I think I can give it one more hour and then I think if I go to bed at midnight I'll still get about 7 and 1/2 hours of sleep.  Sounds good, but this never happens.  So, everynight I stay up doing things that will sadly not bring to me to enlightenment anytime soon.  I wish that I could say that I have an extraordinary social life filled with late night gallery openings and wild parties, but no.  That's not me anyway.  Instead, I'll be washing my hair, helping my friends pick the perfect bridesmaids dress online or shutting the world out with a book.  Tonight I will be, um, let's see, um, well, how about reading my fabulous travel book on London (no, I'm not going anytime soon, I'm just obsessed) until midnight.  And tomorrow morning when I wake up I will think 'This, this is the day that I will go to bed early!'
Who, pray tell, designed apartment buildings so that you can hear everything that is happening in the apartment below you with almost complete and utter accuracy?  I mean, is it that hard to place some sound absorbing panels in between the floors as you build?  Think, architects, think!    My neighbors downstairs are college students.  Why they live in our beautiful, mostly populated by the elderly and some young professionals, far away from the college they attend apartment complex, I don't know.  And, I actually, don't know them.  I know that one is a boy and one is a girl.  I know that the boy plays guitar and sometimes tries to sing along, mostly Dave Matthews songs.  I know the girl will occasionally put on some Jason Mraz.  (My connections to the above musicians would probably blow their minds, but I will never be friends with these college brats and so they will never know.)  And, I know that I can hear the boy cough at times.  What does that mean he can hear me do?  I wonder about this one.  Tonight, they are listening to the radio and they have what I think is a subwoofer cranked up so as I sit here trying to watch TV or listen to my music, I just hear deep voices and bass.  It BLOWS!!!!!!!!!  So, being the oh so nice and always ready to lend you some sugar should you be baking something neighbor, I turned up my subwoofer to the MAXIMUM.  Take that you slackers!  I am usually quite kind with my subwoofer.  When my brother installed it and put it at Maximum, I told him I had neighbors below and that it needed to go lower, a lot lower.  So much for thinking of other people.   The reason for this retaliation is that I think that they like to bang their ceiling, my floor, when they think that I am being loud.  I am not loud.  OK, so I always have some kind of noise on, I hate quiet, but when I am watching TV and they bang, and I check the volume, it is on 2 bars.  'OK people, I pay enough in rent to listen to my TV at 2 FUCKING BARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'  I am not actually sure what the banging is about.  I wonder sometimes if it is my imagination.  What could 2-3 pounding-like sounds in rapid succession be?  One day I came home and as I walked in the door I heard the 2 bangs.  I threw my stuff down and yelled at the floor 'I haven't even been here to make noise.  What, you don't like it when I open my door?'    Maybe, just maybe, there is some phantom mouse running around and driving them crazy while I am constantly monitoring my volume.  I can't help but remember the Friends episode where the old neighbor below is always banging on his ceiling when the friends are not actually making noise.  When he dies and they go to his apartment they hear what sounds like a party going on above them, but they are all in his apartment. Could this be what is happening in my building? I don't know, but I always turn down the noise if I hear the banging until, of course, tonight and the subwoofer wars.  Game on!
Richmond's annual chili cook-off held many feasts for my eyes:  1) William Hung.  I know, you're jealous.  He was one act among many at the festivities and his one song performance of 'She Bangs' was almost worth the $20 admission fee.  2) People wearing clothes that should have been retired years ago (or never purchased)- a) Belly shirts- these should only be worn by people who do not actually have bellies and then only when they want other women to hate them. b) Clothing that is too tight- there was a woman who looked normal in everyway except that her tan linen pants were a bit snug above her thighs, and by snug I mean she had a perma-wedgie. c) Stripper shoes- The shoes which I am referring to had a 3 inch clear plastic heel, silver souls, and clear plastic straps.  I know, you're jealous again.  Note to self- don't go to the chili cook-off as can't handle the dress requirements.  3) People running after beer- the beer trucks ran out of beer about an hour before the cook-off ended.  We were waiting in line and when they would announce that the beer was gone people would scatter quickly to another truck, and so on, and so on.  Note to self- don't go to an event where grown people run after silly things, unless there is a sale on at Saks.  4) A woman's bare ass- as I walked to my car I saw that the passenger door of the car beside me was open, blocking my door.  There was no one around and as I got closer and closer I looked for someone to tell that I needed to close the door.  Then, as I approached my car I saw that there was in fact someone behind the door, a woman's bare ass peeing.  Um, OK, um, um, look in the other direction, um, wait, um, don't look, hope that friend tells her I am here, um, um.  When she is done and is pulling up her pants over her bare ass and says 'I'm sorry, I just really had to pee,' say 'It's OK, do what you gotta do' and quickly get in your car and pull away.  Note to self- never, never have to pee that bad.
When I checked the mail one day last week and saw the oversized, cream envelope with my name and address perfectly printed on it, I thought 'Oh hell, here's another one.'  I open it to find an invitation to a cousin's wedding in May.  As I scan the card for the wedding, the reception, the directions, and the reply card I think, 'And so the season begins.'  Every year there is a flow of weddings in my life.  I have probably been to at least 50 weddings since I was small.  Since college, they just keep on coming.  Someone told me that there is usually a boom right after college and then again in your 30s.  Um, there has been no let up in the bombing, apparently the troops refuse to surrender, give up and just go home.  I do have to say that I sometimes, am on the firing squad, well in some capacity anyway.  This year marks the seventh run as a bridesmaid for me  (OK, so 2 of them were my brothers, but still 7, come on people).  That's right, seventh (this does not include the ones in which I will merely be a spectator).  I love my friends and family and am so honored to be included in these special days and this is no diss on them in anyway.  This is all about me.  I mean, it's always about me anyway, right?    This year are the weddings of 2 very special people, my cousin who is like a sister to me and my best friend who basically is a sister to me.  These are probably the most special ones that I will be a part of and in my best friend's I am the maid of honor.  When she asked me, I cried, and then reality set in, this is my 7th time walking down the aisle, alone.  Oh, there are no pitty parties, Anna is an independent.  One friend said, 'Well, at least you're getting closer.'  I was like, um thanks, that's as close as I want to be, for now anyway.  So, I do my duties of planning and attending showers, giving my measurements to strangers (probably the worst part of the whole process), and being there for the bride in any way she might need.  I do all of this thinking, as Cinderfuckinrella (thanks Pretty Woman) did, that someday my prince will come.  But, oh no, don't think he needs to rescue me, no.  I've already rescued myself.  I want a prince for all the other reasons, plenty of cash, big house, private jet.  No, really, I want a prince who is prince of humanity in that he treats me and everyone I love with kindness, who is so funny that I laugh out loud just thinking about things he has done or said, who wants to learn to do things that I love just because I love them, and who wants me to do the same for him.  I think my friends (and cousin) have found these princes, I know they have.  I'm just hoping that they haven't gotten the last ones.
I love NPR.  Music stations can make you feel like you are stuck on repeat of a mixed CD.  The same songs over and over.  People, please.  But then, there in the distance, on the hour, every hour, and during rush hour and some good hours on Friday night and Sunday, there is NPR to rescue me.  I like a pop song just as much as the next person, but I don't think that I ever actually will 'find [you] in a club with a bottle full of bub,' but I do know people who have taken prozac which now appears to be causing suicidal tendencies.  (I heard this tidbit before eyeing it on any other news source that day.)  I love the idea of multitasking, driving and getting abreast of what is, or is not, going on in the world.  I can't watch news on TV anymore, unless it's BBC and then only when I'm actually in England, because the inane (trying to be) analytic dribble drabble that procludes from these people's mouths is too much for me to stand.  I tell my father everytime that I am home that FoxNews is one of those broadcasts that actually does write its copy for people with an 8th grade education because that is there audience (if you didn't know, that's suppose to be the industry standard for level of writing, 8th grade, yeah I know).  He just ignores me and continues to be 'dumbed down.'  Newspapers are fine, but I don't have the dough to subscribe to them and reading a newspaper online just doesn't seem right to me.  And so, when I get in my car and I'm just sick of hearing the same 4 songs, I check the clock and thank God that it is after 4 in the afternoon and there is information to be learned as I drive  home.  Some days, I even leave early in the morning so that I can hear the more in-depth news as I drive in (the closer you get to 9am the more 'entertaining' the pieces get).  I mean, all things considered I just need a little fresh air to handle this American life.
Today I heard a school secretary say to a little girl, 'Now, you're not going to get suspended anymore, are you?'  As I passed by the conversation I wanted to say, 'No, you're wrong.  This little GIRL wouldn't do something to get suspended.  I mean look at her, she's cute, well-dressed, calm, and polite.'  And then metacognition set in and I realized that I had just committed a mental act of sexism.  Our mothers might not understand why this scene might make us step back and take note of our place on the 'balance of the sexes.'  My mother didn't even begin college until I, her third child, was in elementary school.  And she is the only one of her sisters to have a college degree.  A few years ago, she got her Masters in Administration (approximately 1 year before I go my Masters), hoping to become a school principal.  It seems that her age has hindered those hopes, sexism replaced by ageism.  (My mom is older than my friends' parents.  She has a 39 year-old son after all.)  I'm not sure if this is really true, but she continued teaching and thanks to Bush's unfunded No Child Left Behind, she has, in fact, been left behind.  It now appears that she must have in hand a different type of Masters to do the same job she's been doing for 3 years.  But, I'm sure that 40 years ago she never would have thought she'd be worrying about what type of Masters Degree she had.  Former generations of women only hoped that women would have as many choices and possibilities that we do now, but with the entire world laid out before us, what do we really have but more questions?  What if we just want to be married and have children?  And that's it.  What if we want it that simple?  Is it sacrilege to not take advantage of the choices, or is that the whole point anyway?  I personally would feel no shame in dropping the 50,000 dollars and 20 plus years spent on my education to be a happy homemaker.  But, alas, baby making and the perfect spinach quiche are not the path I stumbled onto, nor will it be anytime in the near future.  After all, I have a research project due for my 'might turn into a PhD' class.
When riding my bike and a slight hill appears I must use all my leg power to tackle the mere incline (I'm not talking real hills).  As I'm peddaling with more and more emphasis I can't help but be aware of my powerhouse legs.  My calves are huge and this is not actually related to me being overweight.  There are two reasons for my treetrunk legs.  First, there is genetics (I know, blame your mother).  But seriously, I've never seen the women in my family ever really break a sweat, sure there is the occasional walking of the dog, but no intense exercise going on, and yet these women do not have dainty legs.  We have legs built for... well I don't know what for.  The second reason is Linda Watkins School of Dance.  I was a dancer from age 4 to 18 and dancers have powerhouse legs, how else could they leap like that?  I tapped, balleted, toed, and jazzed my way through 14 years of jetes, plies, and time steps.  I usually hated dance class, but the recitals I lived for.  There is nothing like being on stage and performing.  My favorite was the kick line.  And still, years later, when I hear Elvis Costellos' 'Hot Hot Hot' (which is not that often) I want to throw some eye high kicks and do a split, oh there were splits.  Sadly, I couldn't do a split now if you paid me.  I miss the way a dancer knows her body, how every move is fluid and somehow perfectly calculated, even walking can be a dance.  Our dance instructor used to tell us a story about a dancer's grace.  The story goes that she was coming home from the grocery store holding a bag of groceries in each hand.  When she stepped up her back stairs to her house, she slipped on a thin layer of ice.  And this is where the grace comes in- she would emphasize that because she was dancer, she knew how to fall and thus landed safely on the ground, legs folded perfectly to soften the full body blow.  The strange thing is that I don't remember ever practicing or in fact ever falling in dance class, but I understood what she was saying.  A dancer's right hand always knows and reacts to what the left hand is doing.  I've never broken a bone, pulled a muscle, or torn a ligament, could this be due to the dancing?  I don't know but, thanks to Linda Watkins, when I'm 85 and fall down my front stairs, I may not in fact break my hip.
I was cruising on my bike through Windsor Farms today.  It's a posh neighborhood in Richmond's westend where the houses are big and beautiful, the yards are kept up by hired hands I'm sure, and all children go to St. Catherine's, or St. Christopher's (cause being educated along ghettofied kids is to much of a reality for these folks).  OK, so I would like to own a house here, but my kids would go to public school, damnit.  On my bike tour past the beautiful AgeCroft (yes, some aristocratic cook had the house torn apart and shipped over here from England, but this was a long time ago when ghettofied kids would have been slaves).  The house is amazing and has a prescious spot in Richmond, it rests on a small hill and looks out to a small mountain which has not been tainted with developments.  It's serene, and reminds me of my hometown and of my last home, C-ville.  Growing up among moutains, I hated them.  My hometown is in a valley and therefore surrounded on all sides as if the hills protect and keep the people below.  And, in many ways they did, my hometown is a sheltered place.  Though quaint at times, it could possibly be the redneck version of 'A City Upon (surrounded by) A Hill (hills).'  But, we all know what happens to Utopia, oh yeah, it doesn't exist.  So, for most of my life I have cursed the moutains and hills, especially when trying to learn how to drive a stick shift (I actaully gave up trying for a good year).  I didn't start to accept and reclaim them until this past summer in Montana.  I traveled to Montana for a friends wedding and when I stepped off the plane and found myself surrounded by mountains I thought I was back in my hometown except there are no semi-tall buildings and I don't think they know what urban sprawl is.  Throughout the weekend I kept thinking, 'What is so great about these moutains?'  OK, so they are huge and the ranges are much bigger than Virginia's and they are bit more pristine, but really, no Virginian would be that amazed as I wasn't.  Then when drving back to C-ville from the airport in DC and going up and down the rolling hills, I thought 'These are my hills, Montana has nothing on these.'  I think I began to love my state then.  I'm proud to be a Virginian which is saying something, considering I have always wished to be an North Carolinian.  Richmond has no hills or mountains to look at, we're too far east.  I actually miss them.  Some days as I'm driving to work I feel like I don't have everything that I need for the day, I check everything, my watch, my purse, my coffee and I and can't find the missing piece, but maybe it's the moutains, the Blue Ridge, that I'm missing, without really knowing it.
My sister-in-law had an embroidered pillow which rested on her white loveseat which sat in an area off to the side of her kitchen in her former house.  The pillow said, in green thread, 'Bloom Where You're Planted' and of course had simple, colorful flowers sprouting underneath the words.  The first time I saw this pillow, I thought 'What a great saying.'  After 3 eye-opening, ego-blasting years in a teaching position that drove me to see a therapist, a move to a new city, a new job, and lots of downtime, I can now see the sunlight.  The cloud which followed me around all my life, much like the dust cloud that follows PigPen from Charlie Brown, has lifted.  The weather is not always clear, it rains and storms still, but mostly there are sunny days.  I've moved to Richmond to start over and when I first moved here I was so excited and thrilled to begin again and to do it right this time.  Well, 6 months into living here, I was not happy.  The cloud was back, my apartment was a shambles, and I hated waking up to go to work every morning.  I was obsessed with New York City and sad that I could not afford to move there or to London, or anywhere.  Then I began to repeat and reflect on that pillow in my sister-in-laws kitchen.  And while I'm not ready for blooming, at least for now, I think I'll germenate.  And I'm sure, with all this sunlight, a stem will form.   Next Time  Ginko trees live 1,000 years. Eating the leaves will clear you brain. When I heard about them, I thought of my mother, how much I would like to sit under one with her in the ancient shade, nibbling the flesh, the stem, the central vein.  ~Naomi  Shihab Nye
I love the bridges of Richmond.  They are no architectural triumphs by any means.  They are simple and quiet, sometimes elegant, and to me, quite satisfying.    My favorite is the Nickel bridge.  It is a small two lane bridge that is made of intricate iron workings on either side and is lighted by short lamps which are part of the iron work.  It is a quaint bridge and one of the quite one I think.  As cars pass each other in close proximity, it's as if they are quitely saying hello to each other.    The one I take to work everyday, the Powhite Pkwy, is a toll bridge and although I pay everyday and hope that my $.50 will soon make enough of a difference that the tolls will soon go away, I make sure to enjoy the view on either side of me.  On the left is a train bridge that was clearly built when we took time for grandeur and beauty in transportation.  The train bridge is grey stone with slender arches that reach just under the flat top.  Everytime I look at this bridge I imagine riding in a cafe car on a train in the 20s, sipping tea and headed south to somewhere fabulous.  Just visible beyond the train bridge is the Nickel bridge, much shorter than the train bridge and sometimes I think it is a whisper of a bridge in the distance.  Back to the right side of the Powhit bridge.  On the right is only the James river and it's tree lined banks.  The river is a bit rocky at this point and every morning I can gauge the level of percepitation west of Richmond.  When the river is at a normal level, birds perch on some rocks that barely rest above the water level.  The first time I saw I bird sitting on one of these tiny rocks, I wondered if he thought himself a daredevil.   The Hugenot bridge is at the end (or beginning) of Cary St.  It extends into the posh westend of Richmond.  This bridge is two lanes with rails on either side that mimic a picket fince in metalic piping.  But, it's length is what is so fascinating.  It goes for at least a quarter mile and part of is not over water at all.  When you start the bridge from the Cary St. side you enter and curve around into a grove of trees.  Because it's a bridge a this point, you feel as if you are suspended through a small forest.  As you curve around, train tracks appear quickly and then the banks of the of the river.  It's a bit like a fairytale bridge, no exactly magical, but unnexpected.  The Willey Memorial Bridge mimics the Hugenot bridge in length and setting, but is far different in description.  The bridge is all concrete and lit by standard street lights.    The Lee Memorial bridge is my least favorite.  It connets downtown to a area that could be referred to as the 'projects,' a sad and large part of this troubled town.  This bridge is open to pedestrians on either side so that the blank concrete feel is even more guarded by chain link fencing.  Although the bridge is wide with four lanes, you feel boxed in and can't see the water underneath.  The idea and realization of being suspended over rushing water does elevate the drab feel of this bridge for the brief trip over the James.  The 2nd st. bridge is another non-descript bridge, but on the downtown bank there is a memorial to Vietnam veterans of Virginia.  It's a beautiful memorial, a large stone wall in the background, a grand shape of a women inside, behind a glass wall.  I've haven't seen it up close, it's on my list of things to do.  Just the other day I discovered an walking suspension bridge under the 2nd st. bridge.  The walking bridge literally hangs below the towering car bridge above.  It reminds me of the Millineum Bridge in London, another beautiful walking suspension bridge.
My name is Anna and I reside in the old town of Richmond, VA.  I'm a Virginian by birth, but this my first time living in the capitol city.  I'm a teacher for children with special needs in public schools.  I used to teach children with Autism which was fascinating.  For a long time, Autism was my passion.  At times, I still yearn to work with those kids again.  I'm damn good at it, but the culture of Autism is too abrasive for me.  It's a complicated, long story.  I love the kids, it's just everything that surrounds them and thus henders a teacher's effectiveness was too much for me.  I like what I do now, but not sure if I love it.  What does it mean to love a job?  What does it mean to love anything?  I just turned 27 with no fanfair and am in the throws of confusion and searching that inhabits all 20somethings.  Things about me:  when 'Sex and the City' ended I felt like my best friends moved away.  I love my nieces and nephew.  I love to read pop fiction (yes, Bridget Jones is a friend of mine).  I have TiVo.  I used to write poetry (fairly seriously in college and worked with some big names).  I have a very well decorated apartment, it's beautiful if I do say so myself.  I love to cook and don't do it enough.  I need to learn to exercise frequently.  I wish that I could: take amazing photographs, publish some poems/ book/ picture/ dna, travel to any city anytime, live in NYC, live in London, etc.
Do you remember watching music videos?  I mean really watching them, like for hours.  My brother and I, along with some neighborhood kids at times, would sneak snippets of MTV.  We were banned from such filth as kids though we seemed to watch endless amounts of it, our parents not as quick as they were prudish.    I was enamored with George Michael.  Funny, he never seemed gay to me at age 10, but then again I didn't know what gay was then either.  He was the perfection of hotness to me and that song, Careless Whisper, where he crones after a lover lost and that stubble, whew that stubble.   These days, he's not so hot and I wonder why I never saw the obvious 'batting for the other team' going on, but again, this was the 80s, I donât think he was letting many people in on his secrets, lest he lose album sales.  A few months ago I was flipping through the channels and found FUSE, a music video channel here in Richmond where all they do is play videos.  I was stunned.  Some flashy hip-hop song was on and I paused, filling the commercial time during another program and actually watched a whole video.  I felt like I was 12 again, the volume turned down, the den door closed, and my finger on the remote ready to switch channels should the door open and my mother walk in.   I haven't watched another video since that FUSE moment months ago.  I miss the old videos where the stories were weak, if anything, the bands were overly made up, and the women had clothes on.  The current generation has no idea what endless, mindless hours of music videos are like.  They think MTV was created to expose the unreality of 18-23 lives.  The teeny boppers today won't have slumber parties and stay up late to see how many times their favorite videos appear.  They're lucky if they see their favorite video once during the terribly drab TRL.    And, what happened to a music video doing magic for the unknown artists?  The one hit wonders of the 80s would be nowhere without their videos.  Remember Divo and the whips?  My brother's band made a video a few years ago.  And if you blinked you missed it.  It did nothing for them because kids don't watch videos anymore, they want the (non) reality shows or the watered down, over-produced, uncreative pop star in their mist, and they only want the 10 best knows videos of the day.  Or at least, this is what MTV thinks they want.  MTV has gone from groundbreaking to heartbreaking.  And VH1, don't even let me go there.  And it's sad to realize that I am no longer the target audience of MTV.  They don't care about my demographic anymore, even though I busted my butt sneaking hours of videos into my childhood.  Sorry Dire Straits, you can have your money for nothin'.  It turns out I don't want my MTV.
I was playing with my 3 year-old niece today when she said 'I'm the king of the castle.'  Then pointed to me and said, 'You're the dirty rascal.'  And I was immediately placed inside the melody of CRASH.  I was irrovacably sadden that my childhood is now wrapped inside the lyrics of a Dave Matthews song.   Then later, in the backyard waiting for the hotdogs on the grill I heard a bright, highpicthed song lingering in the air.  I knew immediately that it was an ice cream truck.  Whew!  How long has it been since I've seen on one of those.  Oh, the days of yore.  *sigh*
People, really.  You can leave comments.  I don't bite and I like to hear from the people I love in my life.  Really, I'd like to hear from you.  Seriously.  If you stop by, tell me so.   Love ya,
I'm funny.  Ask my friends; they'll tell you I'm funny.  It's my thing, my party trick.  I come from a long line of funny people.  No, none of them are famous.  We're funny the way your family is funny.  The way you take family or friendly information and turn it around, spin it on it's head, give it a sarcastic tone or link it to a historical travesty and spit it back into the air.  My relatives have dry and sarcastic one-liners down to a science.  It's like a racket ball game when we are gathered together. The puns and witty observations fly so fast youâre not sure you can hurl them back, but then, you do, you always do.  And so, I find friends who can play this game, who can come together in one accord on making fun of the world and each other.    Friday night, sitting amongst a group of co-workers for 'happy hour' I was anything but happy.  Oh, I was jovial and jokey and witty and brilliant, but somewhere along the line I realized that this wasn't the real funny me.  I had to work hard that night to tone my references down and to pull what little information I knew about these people to the front of my brain.  I've only worked with them for 6 months and this is only the third large group social thing we've done.  There is a few staff I know really well and with them I can joke all day, there is enough reference material there, but when you stick me with a large group of people I only see in the hallways I can't do much.      My jokes on Friday landed on unfertile ground.  There were some hits, but mostly misses.  When you don't know the people well, you're jokes and puns and one liners have to come from outside the group, I usually choose current events, historical events, local events, world events, OK so anything really.  But I'm sad to say I don't think my audience understood my references.  There was a discussion of a painting in the Mexican restaurant, which was of a man holding his own head.  I said I thought it was John The Baptist and then asked whose name was signed.  It was Raphael.  I stated again that I was pretty sure it was John The Baptist.  A co-worker said, 'Is it a religious thing?'  'Um,' I thought, 'I give up.'   Then there was my self-deprecating comment when another co-worker asked if I had gone to VCU with him, that I looked like someone in his ethics class.  I stated that I had no ethics, so no, I didn't go to VCU.  He didnât bowl over with laughter.  'Whatâs wrong with you?' I thought and then realized I don't really know these people.    Sometimes I don't want to spend all that time it takes to get to know people, I just want it to be immediate.  My cousin's wife was telling me about a dinner party she and 5 other women have every month.  They get together and discuss politics by having various members' research topics then they come together to discuss.  She said she thought of me and that this is something right up my alley.  Well, after tonight and the failed attempts at garnering some sort of recognition for my brilliant repartee, I think she is right.  I need some good conversation, I need some deep thinking, I some cognitive stimulation.
I went to Carytown today with my brother's little family.  My 6 year-old nephew's artwork was being displayed in a window of a store there, part of a city-wide school art project.  He was 1 of 2 children chosen from his 1st grade class to be placed for all the passersby to see.  It was a great picture full of blue and red and purple and white and yellow.  There was clearly a sky with clouds and then there are 2 distinct sections on the bottom.  One blue square section takes up the majority of the picture with two building shaped things inside.  To the right of the large blue square is a skinny blue rectangle with an American flag in it, just hanging out.   I asked the little artiste what exactly he had painted and he shrugged.  His grandmother said it was a house and then I asked 'Well, is it a house that you thought up in your mind or a particular house?'  He said he just thought it up.  'All right, well, good picture little boy.'    I then began talking and playing with the little nieces when the artiste's mom states that the two buildings are 'Our house and Annieâs apartment building.'  I turned my body and swung my head around, 'What, my apartment building?'  To which the little one said 'Yeah' in his sweet, Well-what-else-could-it-be-? voice.  I looked at the picture again and there it was in all the many colors.  It was clearly a small one-story house sitting beside a 3-story brick apartment building.  How did I not see it before?  I said, 'Well, look at that, I'm famous.'  And then the love swept over me.  When a 6 year old paints your apartment building into a picture, that is love, real love.  Thank you my little A----baby.  I love you too.
I believe that dog-earing pages in a book is sac-religious.  I think I may have engaged in this practice when I was 12 for a day or two, but it never stuck.  It seemed too finite a thing to do.  Reading a book is a fluid thing.  Though you stop, put it down, go on about your life and come back to it, the story is fluid, or should be.  So, to me, dog-earing the pages is like telling the pages, even the words to stop going, stop moving because the crease is always there.  It stands as an acknowledgement that someone paused this scene, stopped the monologue, or took a break between chapters.  It will take days of hard pressing to reduce the dog-eared indentation.  For me, the damage is permanent.  Literal and literary disrespect has occurred, something a book can never shake off.  So I use anything I can get my hands on to save my places.  I have bookmarks, but they never seem to find their way into the books.  In bookstore checkout lines I see pretty little bookmarks with clichÃ©d phrases and artsy black and white pictures and salivate.  But my Pavlovian reflexes are always pushed aside because I know that the $3 bookmark will sit in a drawer or beside a stack of books and never actually make it into one.  There is no real reason for this.  When I need to hold my place I franticly search for something flat or something related to the process of reading.  Beside my bed there are a number of books 'held' by varying objects.  The most frequently read book has my glasses holding court, the short story book that I dip in and out of is splayed, open side down on a table, a book of memoirs is conversing with my itty bitty book lightâ¢, a travel book on London is held in place with the thin, red, satin ribbon attached to it, and another short story book has the receipt for itself tucked inside.   The receipt is my favorite placeholder.  I think this is partly sentimental in that every time I open the book I look at it and remember the store and the circumstances for the purchase.  Partly I'm sure I do this to subconsciously remind myself to get every bit of escapism and pleasure out of the $10.95 I spent on the paperback edition.  And partly because it's convenient and perfect.  A receipt takes up no space between the pages, it doesn't ask you to clip it on, it just slides right in like it was meant to be there and it never leaves a mark.  It's the answer to the damaging dog-ear.  It's the lazy womanâs pause button.  It's quite possibly the very best un-bookmark.  Yesterday I was digging through my assortment of not-yet-read books and discovered an odd bookmark tucked inside Carson McCullers' THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER.  I'm sure at the time, my former therapist's business/ appointment card was the closest thing around when I stopped reading.  I can't imagine that I just randomly put this card in this book.  It was slipped between pages 4 and 5.  A bookmark placed so early in a book would make me think that I never really began reading it.  Maybe I went for a teaser from the first couple of pages.  I have a terrible habit of beginning books and then about 20-50 pages into it, I pick up another book (see the bedside assortment listed above).  This is one of my worst habits and one I really hate. Commitment phobia rears it's ugly head in some many places in my life.  I just can't help but think there is a small, or rather quite large, message in THAT card in THAT book.  Sometimes I wonder...
I have seasoned chicken in the oven right now.  The smell is amazing and began wafting from the kitchen about 10 minutes after I put it in the 350Âº box.  The smell is of earthy paprika, pungent garlic, and sweet basil.  It smells like home, like a weekday dinnertime when a family's house is quiet after a day of harried activities and mouths are watering.   My father gave me this container which describes its contents as 'The Worldâs Best Chicken Rub.'  He bought it at Food Lion, a place I never go because Ukrop's has spoiled me and I am OK with the overpriced ingredients for my cooking, or lack there of.  I don't even know where a Food Lion is around here.  I'm sure I've passed one on my travels trough town, but I couldn't tell you where.  The seasoning gift was unexpected and handed to me in the Food Lion bag with the receipt still inside.  Two containers where purchased, one for me and for my brothers family.  I think I was the afterthought, but my dear sweet dad didn't want to leave me out.     The seasoning is described as a 'rub' and the directions tell you to brush the seasoning mixed with oil and lemon juice over the chicken.  In my kitchen, the brush consists of a plastic bag and there is no lemon juice.  A poor single girl's kitchen is usually devoid of fancy cookery, i.e. brushes or fresh citrus.  I actually do own a cooking brush, however, I believe I bought it at the dollar store and then only in the hopes that I would someday make delicate puff pastries brushed with butter.  I have made none so far.    The brush did make an appearance two weeks ago on Easter weekend when my visiting mother sort of decided I would cook a ham for the family on Saturday night.  I didn't know until I was cooking it that this would be my job.  I've never cooked a ham before.  Luckily, store-bought spiral sliced hams are pre-cooked, you just have to know how to heat them up and glaze them.  The glazing scared me and when I asked my mom how to do this she simply said 'brown sugar and mustard.'  'OK,' I thought 'but how the hell much of either one?'  I couldnât ask her again, she was busy with my little nieces and there was an air of 'Have you learned nothing from me?' in her voice.  I looked in the cupboard and found a clump of petrified brown sugar and of course there is always mustard in the fridge.  I remembered that brown sugar comes back to life with heat so I set the stove to high flame, put the brown sugar and a splash of water in a small pot, squirted about 6 seconds worth of mustard and stirred.  The resulting taste test was good; it tasted familiar, like sweet Easter ham.    Two hours into the ham warm-up I pulled it out and brushed on my brown sugary mixture.  The glaze was perfect, sweet and tart and just right for a first time try.  My parents let me keep the leftovers because I'm poor and because they live 3 hours away.  I said thanks, that I'd eat on it all week.  I didn't touch it after they left, despite my glaze of glory.  The first few months I lived on my own with no dining hall or catering company to feed me (college dorms and sorority respectively) I bought more food than 3 people could eat in 2 months almost each week.  I researched and concocted difficult recipes from Martha Stewart and Junior League cookbooks.  I even spent 3 hours on a fancy dinner for a going away party for a friend once.  (I've since learned that friends will come over for your grilled cheese as much for your 'whole roasted chicken with goat cheese and sage.')  Now, I've settled into the typical single girl's fridge.  I have a door full of condiments waiting for a salad or bread and meat or even fries, but I have none of those things actually in the fridge to put them upon.   In college, my fridge was stocked for weekends and nights I just didn't want to leave the apartment to go eat with my 'sisters.'  One roommate and I would try to make what we thought were balanced meals.  We would go grocery shopping and come home to heat up canned beans, boil a bag of rice, and bake chicken with rosemary in tinfoil for 45 mins.  We thought our moms would be proud.  We also bought an entire red velvet cake once and after 2 days gave up the polite slicing and plating to simply spear it with a fork as we stood at the kitchen counter in our pajamas and bare feet and chatted about how we had really sunk to a new low.  During the day today I had a brilliant thought of going to the store after work to pick up a fresh lemon to squeeze in the bag with the chicken and over some freshly cooked rice.  I never made it to the store and the poor herbed chicken has no side dishes, no friends to share the stomach with.  A single girl just doesn't have the time or the energy really for all the fuss, and especially all those dishes.  There will probably be no leftovers either (what with the 1 piece of chicken I fixed), my fridge will go another day (or 10) with not much more than fancy mustard and light Italian dressing.  But, right now my dinner's calling me.
Miraculously my blessed computer is now typing.  I have no idea why it decided to go bananas and turn the letters 'HJKL andM' into '1234 and 5.'  I took it to school today and I think maybe my baby didn't like being away from home.  I wasn't that upset as my computer has been showing signs of trouble for a few months and I expect that everyday may be it's last day.  I have an order to send it in to Apple but am terrified that they will wipe out the memory and start over with all the programs.  This makes me want to run away with my sweet sick computer and try to nurse it back to health.  But, I know I canât do that.  So I'll have to work on saving all my things like my music and documents and pictures.  This is not that hard, just dump it on a disc, but I have a habit of rereading things and going through everything and reminiscing.  What should take me about 2-3 hours will probably take me 2-3 days.  I'm just sentimental like that.    My laptop is my baby.  In fact, that's its name, My Baby.  In the upper right hand corner of my Macintosh G4 Titanium is a tiny replica of my hard drive and the words 'My Baby' underneath.  My laptop is one of my best friends.  Not like 'Oh I canât wait to go home and type on my computer.'  But kinda.  And no, I'm not a computer nerd.  I use it for writing and Internet and wellâ¦ music and pictures and to watch movies and a to play a game for about an hour every 6 months or so.  It's like a best friend who enjoys a good flick, listens to my favorite tunes, and doesn't disagree with my neurotic banter, AND travels with me almost everywhere I go.   This current computer is 2 years old, but is still fabulous.  When I bought my G4, my older G3 was only 2 years old and one of my brothers thought that I was crazy to buy another one and asked which one I liked better.  I stated that it was like choosing between two children, it was like Sophie's Choice, the Apple Macintosh version.  If you like Macs then you LOVE them.  There are few Mac people who could go either way, PC or Mac.  I am quite obsessed with my Macs.  I've had 3 so far and used pretty much every version they have come out with.  They are beautiful, efficient, and easy to use machines.  This is the first time I have ever had enough trouble with one that the friendly techies on the Apple help line couldn't solve.  This is the first time they have asked for me to hand over my baby.  I'm scared, but today with the typing fiasco I came to terms with having to let go for bit and let the experts do their thing.  Then I realized that my G3 was still available.  I couldn't wait to get home and dig it out, to feel the tall, black keys under my fingers.  Pressing them is like pressing down on soft dough.  It makes writing fluid and effortless.  I miss that keypad.    When I opened the black chunky laptop I ran my hands over its edges.  The design team at Apple gave the G3 PowerBook curves, like a woman.  The edges are smooth and shapely; the sides of the computer make subtle 'S' shapes.  It's high fashion, computer style.  I miss the friendly rainbow Apple at the base of the screen.  It goes to show that Apple did not make a big enough impact on the world market to claim the rainbow Apple without bringing along the rainbow symbol and all of its stereotypes.  Apple now goes for a sleek mono-colored, often white or grey, Apple, a more stylish replacement to its colorful twin.  The rest of my G3 is simple and elegant.  There are no extra buttons to 'go straight to the internet,' 'open youâre email,' or anything else that junks up a PC keyboard.  There could be key functions that did those things for me of course, but I get to decide, Apple does not predetermine my preferences.  I think the thing I love most about Apple is the company's adherence and strive for simplicity.  Their computers have clean lines and their mice have one button, not five.  Choices can complicate life.  A simple gift, that is was Apple has given us in its computers.  PC people think that we Mac people are strange.  'The whole world is Windows and you are using a Mac.  You poor deluded youth,' someone once told me.  I told him he better step back and then began my rant on why Macs reign supreme.  I was showing someone a keying shortcut on a Mac (like open Apple and s for save) and explaining the ease and simplicity of Macs and she said 'Oh, they got those shortcuts from Windows.'  I said, 'No you didn't' and then explained how Bill Gates just made a PC version of the perfected Mac interface because people were sick of having to remember which drive to boot up and save on.  Deluded youth indeed.  My cousin says she would rather go without a computer than own a PC, which is what she is currently doing.  She gets her Mac on at work.    It's a far better place at the top of world my friends.  Come to the land of milk and Apples, we are a friendly, simple-minded, and visionary bunch.  And remember... as you sulk at us that almost every piece of music or visual media you hear or see has been touched by Apple.    *Anna is OK with being in love with her computer.
My computer is on the blitz.  When I went to type today this is what I got: 2230234550300 and that was just hitting random letter keys.  Um, OK.  Have to send it off.  I'm scared they will erase it's memory and leave me with a shell of a computer and I will have to start all over.  But, I can't exactly do anything on it unless I develop a code language using 01234 and 5.  But, who has time for that?
Yesterday I stopped by my nephew's soccer practice just to say hi and show him how much I love him.  He loves to show off, but he also gets frustrated with not being perfect when he kicks the ball.  He's 6.  He has a lot of perfectionist disappointments ahead of him.  While I was there a mother of another child came up to talk to my sister-in-law.  She was asking who was the mother of whom and I said I was just an aunt.  She stated how nice it was that I came out to see my nephew.    During school yesterday a teacher was telling me about a girl who was behaving badly (there is a long story about how bad this teacher is and how she creates the behavior problems in her classroom, but that is for another day).  The teacher was talking about the girl and how she lives with her aunt because her own mother is in jail.  The teacher was trying to point out to the girl that she needed to straighten up because he aunt was good to her even though money was tight in her house.  I hear these stories all the time, an aunt or a grandmother or even a great aunt taking custody kids in their families.  For some reason, yesterday, it hit me that this is wonderful and strange at the same time.  Another little boy told me a few weeks ago with a smile on his face that his daddy was out of jail.  This was a follow up to the statement 'my daddy in jail' that preceded a few weeks before.  I often don't know how to react to these statements and they are frequent.   Richmond is a troubled town.  The murder rate here evens out to about 10 murders a month.  That is unbelievable to me.  Crime is so prevalent that it isn't even a frequent topic of conversation.  The newscasters announce the death tolls almost nightly, but my friends and I don't worry because most murders are gang or drug related.  This makes us feel safer, but should it?  I've become desensitized to so much in this town.  I'm not shocked when teachers or kids tell me about people going into or getting out of jail or prison and I'm not surprised by bodies being found behind school buildings or churches being burned down.    I can't help but think that most of my feelings about family members taking on the responsibility of other family members is cultural.  Yesterday, though, I realized when that mother at the soccer field was so impressed that an aunt came out to a soccer practice that I'm so thankful that my nieces and nephew don't live with me.  I can't imagine taking custody of these kids because my brother was in jail (I would of course, but I can't imagine it).  I just can't even fathom it for my family and yet when a child tells me something like this I don't even flinch.  It seems so normal in the schools I teach in.  I realized yesterday that my desensitization is a bad thing.  It causes complacency and this will never help a child.  But, what can I say for Kindergartener whose role models are in jail that will stay with him and keep him off the streets when he grows up?
This is a quote from a graduate of my college from my graduating year,  'I am about to finish up two year of MBA education at the Wharton School and will start work in September at McKinsey & Co in their Brussels office. Between graduation and starting work I plan to bicycle across the USA in 48 days...'  Our five year reunion is this summer and some people have chosen to update all those who are waiting with bated breath to see what they have been up to over that last five years.  The above update caught my eye because really, as if the Wharton School wasn't enough this guy had to throw in his hot job in Brussels and then of course the side note about the cyclying across the USA, but that wasn't enough, no, then he had to add that he'll do it in 48 days.  Sometimes, I wish I had gone to a podunk small town college where I would send in updates like 'I just consolidated my debt and hope to be out of my misery is 5 to 10 years.'  And my podunk fellow classmates would think 'Wow, I really wish my life were as on track as hers.  I really need to reassess my life and get my goals straight.'  OK, well, anyway, I've got to run.  My bicycle needs to ridden, around the block in 48 minutes.  Wahoowah!
Yesterday, Bunny Day, I was driving out to my sister-in-laws' parents' house for Easter dinner (yeah, we're all close like that) and noticed store after store closed.  Her parents live in the suburbs... (sorry, I just puked) and there is mega store juxtaposed to mega store juxtaposed to posh mall along the way to their house.  This is how it went down inside my head:  'Hmm.  Why is Best Buy closed?  What time is it?  It's only 4pm.  Oh yeah, Easter.  But Best Buy is corrupt and charges restocking fees.  Why are they all of a sudden holy?  More like Best Butt to me.  OK, there are no cars in front of World Market, Home Depot, ah Kroger, there you go guys, sell those hams.  Target is closed.  What the?  McDonald's?  You mean I can't go get a Big Mac cause the Easter Bunny is busy.  What?  Oh, Wal-Mart.  Good, dear sweet heathen Wal-Mart.  Damn, rednecks like to shop on Easter, that parking lot is full.  Is Sam Walton rolling over in his grave?  Nordstrom, good for you.  You show them how to fear God, close you store.'  Um, I guess I've never been out on Easter Sunday to realize that we still observe this holiday by barring heathens from their purchases.  I guess I am now a heathen.  Well, good, really, I don't believe in judging people for their religious beliefs anyway so um, a heathen I may be, but I still hang out with non-heathens and other heathens and I love them all.    I think it says a good deal about a company to close on a religious holiday in this country, being that the majority of corporations seem to pray to the God of the U.S. Mint rather than the Almighty.  I didn't even go to church yesterday.  This is the first Easter that I haven't been to church.  I just wasn't down with going to Mass with the rest of my family (the only Catholic is my sister-in-law) cause they don't think I'm Christian enough to drink their wine (Catholics do it right, there is no grape juice up in their joints).  So, I slept and joined the fam. for the important part, the food.  OK, so this is all blasphemous of me to say.  But, I probably would have gone shopping yesterday being none the wiser.  I had no idea we were that pious a nation what with Blue Laws being banished within the last 20 years.  Alright, well, you go people, stand up for something, except of course Kroger and Wal-Mart, you guys keep selling on major holidays cause you never know, I might need to buy some ice or a fishing pole at the last minute.
This past week was my Spring Break from school and I spent most of it tidying up loose ends and looking for a condo (not successfully).  All in all, not an exciting week considering that this time last year I was getting over my jet lag from London.   Last year that I had a longing to revisit my favorite city in all the world.  After my first tiring and horrendous year of teaching, I was planning on going backpacking through Europe with a girlfriend of mine, but she backed out.  Then, I thought I would spend a summer in London as a reward for getting through the fire, but I failed to ever find out how to rent a flat for a reasonable fee for a few months.  So, two years later, after 9/11 and with a pending war in Iraq, I decided that I would go to London, by myself.  There is a time when you realize waiting around for other people isn't worth it.    Luckily, British Airways had cheap tickets and AAA travel helped secure a great cheap hotel and off I went.  My family was not pleased AT ALL.  My brothers were convinced I would be blown up mid flight, my mother thought I would be killed on the streets, but I (and my therapist) thought why live in fear?  I almost backed out though, because at the time the war in Iraq was only a month old and I did get scared.  But I knew I had to get through the bit of fear for many reasons.  So, here is what got my on the plane; I thought, sure I can stay here and be safe and not take the risk and it will drive me crazy because the plane on which I have a reservation will be flying with or without me so I can be on it and be in London or sit here for a week and wish that I had gotten on it, because after all the worrying it didn't blow up.  So, I got on the plane and I loved every minute of it.    It was wonderful and fabulous and there are not enough cliched things to say.  I saw 4 West End shows and revisited my favorite spots and went to museums and shopped and loved it.  A good many people think that it was ballsy of me to go and to go alone.  I've never had that feeling about that trip.  My parents instilled great traveling skills in me and traveling just feels like breathing sometimes.  I love it and I must do it.  I think I am my best self when I am traveling.  I'm an easy traveler.  I don't stress about what the day will bring or getting through an itinerary because the best things happen when you don't plan.  There are too many stories to back up that statement, but the places and cities at the moment should be the tour guides, not a piece of paper or a set schedule.    I missed the traveling this break.  I had planned to treat Richmond as if I were a tourist this week and go to the historical places and museums that I've been meaning to go to, but the week slipped away from me and now I have a paper due.  Sometimes, the real world is not quite a nice as the magical, mystical, travel filled one inside my head.  Oh well, there are always books to take me there.  I'm currently (and just now) reading CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET by Sophie Kinsella, a British novelist.  I bought the book last year in Harrods of all places because I knew that it was not in the US yet and I enjoy her books.  They are the mindless Chick Lit type that a girl just needs sometimes (don't worry I also bought some Seamus Heaney).  So, I hadn't read it until now because I've been trying to read a little more high-brow (though not much more- maybe just a brow lift).  So, I got it out the other night and read a few chapters each day.  Then, in B&N the other day I saw it is out in hardback as a new release.  Funny, how it's not new to me at all and yet it is new, now.     Last year I took Kinsella's book SHOPOHOLIC TIES THE KNOT to London as I had just begun to read it before the trip.  It's about a girl who loves to shop (obviously) who is British, but lives in NYC, but goes back to England to get married (again, obvious).  I would take it on the Tube to read between stops because I also feel that when traveling, you don't need to always act like a tourist (do what the locals do, read on the Tube).  So, I was on the Circle line train going to Leicester Square by way of Embankment reading and reading and being nonchalant. The funny thing is that I was reading about the main character visiting her friend in London and going out for tea in Sloane Square when the train stopped and the doors opened and I heard the announcement of Sloane Square station.  Sometimes, the universe just aligns.  And, no, I don't believe in that crap, but sometimes... Sloane Square and Sloane Square meet and I just can't compete.
And by the devil I mean Uncle Sam.  I now have to sell my soul and get a second job.  Turns out, I do owe taxes (see 4/3/2004 post).  I went back today to pick up the papers that had been sent to the processing center and there it was in black and white tiny type 'You owe (arrow) {a shitload}.'  Thanks Uncle Sam, thanks.  The reason why I owe in the first place is because I tutored some kids with Autism last year.  And, being the honest taxpayer that I am, I reported all income and expenses and now I owe.  That sucks.  Honesty, sometimes, not the best policy for my I-really-want-to-go-shopping-but-now-I-have-to-get-another-job self.  'O where o where has my little life gone?'  Over the hill to 'Do you need any help or are you just looking?'  I'm thinking Barnes and Noble again.  I love that place.  OK, so most of me wishes that small independent bookshops were the norm rather than giant corporate monsters, but when I walk in there and there are a million books on any subject and the Starbucks and the prettiness, oh the prettiness of it all.  I love that place.  I have to work there, not because I love it, but because I have to, to pay the damn taxes and thereby accrue more taxes and then next year get another job and, oh god, will the cycle ever end?  Fraid not.
I hate it when I settle into a quiet night of phone calls to my friends and not one of my dear friends is home.  There is nothing like a warm-hearted answering machine to make a girl feel loved.  I mean my friends are fabulous.  They are kind and funny and fun and far away.  Distance from my good friends hurts sometimes and so when I call them out of an act of loneliness and they are not at home, the loneliness gets deeper.  Their fabulousness outshines my fabulousness to nothing and I go back to what I was doing before the desperate plea for conversation.    Tonight, I got 6 messages and 1 number out of service.  The latter was a friend of a friend that I've been meaning to have over for dinner, but come on people.  Then I think about why I wanted to talk anyway.  So much of the time I am just ranting on in my neurotic self-obsessed way and what is in it for them?  I hope that I am a good friend, but I know that have my bad moments.  One particular friend is excellent at getting me to divulge more and more information.  She is a question asker and she is a lawyer.  She asks for more and more info. to the point that I have to stop myself and say 'OK, so whatâs up with you?' about 45 mins. into our phone calls.  She is great, but she also feeds my self-obsession.  She's also taught me the act the listening because she does it so well.  Then there is my best friend who's mother is a school counselor, need I say more.  While she herself, doesn't have a degree in counseling, she's actually a science nerd, (you know I love you PK) she is fabulous at her second job.  And she does this for all her friends.  In fact, she is so good she just may pick friends based on their level of neediness. Hmmmmm!   The immediate lonliness was brought on by my re-watching of my 'Sex And The City' DVDs.  I just really miss my girlfriends sometimes.  I miss the closeness that women can have in true friendships when you live in close proximity.  My best friend lives across the country and my other dear friends live 2-24 driving hours away.  Oh, the mark of having successful, adventurous, independent women friends!    So, I sit down and write and try to work out whatever brought me to the phone in the first place.  I think about what my friends are doing right now that takes them away from their phones.  Are they out with other friends?  Are they watching a movie?  Are they discussing recently read books?  Are they organizing fundraisers?  Are they laughing?  Are they happy?  I hope they are laughing.  I hope they are happy.  They are my friends and I love them.
On Monday I started the possibility of the process of buying my own place.  I just met with a realtor, that's all, no paper-signing going on, no commitments, yet.  It's a scary thing this idea of home ownership, signing away your life for 30 years.  It's a good idea, financially, but mentally, is this good for me?    I have a few single girlfriends who have bought places.  Two friends in Richmond bought houses.  I think they have balls.  Not that home ownership is that big of a deal, but a house is a big deal.  I personally can't go that big.  The mowing, the pruning, roof replacement, window washing, it's too much.  I can barely handle keeping my 6-room apartment in orderly shape.  I can just imagine the letters from neighbors that I would get concerning the jungle that would certainly grow outside my home.  So a condo, a condo sounds good to me.  It's like an apartment, but I'd get to paint the walls and a tax deduction.    Condo searching is hard.  While I'm still in the beginning stages, I've already seen 3 in person and a bunch online.  Nothing has caught my eye.  I think I am waiting for the perfect one to just fall into my lap.  I'm picky, but open-minded.  I've told my realtor that I'm interested in city properties and no new construction.  I want an old, lived in, worn and wise place.  My very nice, my age, trying to sell me a place realtor took notes.  I checked for a ring. There was one.  What does it say about me when the men I am not attracted to are married?  Does that mean that somewhere out there there is someone who would love my winning personality and bright smile?  Oh, this is not blog about me wanting a relationship.  This is a blog about me wanting, something, a little more of myself, I guess.  There are friends who say, 'You will find him when you least expect it.'  A good friend who is getting married this summer tells every single girl who claims they are OK with being single that they should watch what they say because she felt the same way last year and poof she's getting married.  Well, with my relationship phobias, I haven't been expecting it for um, 27 years so, um where is the unexpected?  OK, I'm still not ready for all that commitment, so am I ready to commit to a condo?  We will surely see.
There is the old cliche that music can change your mood in an instant.  Oftentimes, I am the cliche.  Driving in my car a song on the radio will put in the mood for shopping, reading a book, or dancing within the span of 8 minutes.  The emotional hills and valleys that I go through listening to music come up as quickly as the mileposts on the highway.  On Saturdays, when there is work to be done in my apartment, I open the blinds or windows, turn up the radio on an upbeat (usually hip hop) station and get busy.  Choosing one CD to listen during one period of productive time is more difficult.    I have a habit of listening to an album until it is worn out and tired.  I get a new album and listen to it over and over.  I've been known to put certain songs or even the whole CD on repeat for hours.  Because of this, I know every word to albums of bands like U2, Sarah Mclachlan, James, Harry Connick Jr., Billy Brag and Wilco, Michelle Shocked, David Wilcox, Jimmy Buffet, and show tunes like Les Mis and Phantom.  So much useless information floating around my brain taking up space for real knowledge like whom all of my government representatives are and how they vote in their various arenas.  I know that this mind hoarding of information happens to everybody to some degree, but not only do lyrics hide in my long-term memory, but with those lyrics and melodies are visual, olfactory, and textural memories.  Songs, and especially whole albums can bring back days, events, and sometimes-whole years.  Like James 'Laid' CD evokes the memory or Camp Morehead where I was a (non-sailing) counselor for one summer in high school.  I had brought the only CD player for the cabin so I forced the 12-13 year old girls to listen to my brooding British music.  Camp Morehead was dismantled a few years ago and the land sold to people building their dream second homes on the shores of many peoples childhood summers.  I actually hated camp, but every once in a while when I listen to 'Laid' I wish for the slow breeze coming off the Bogue Sound and all the little SunFish sailing in the wind.  There is another CD in my collection that I bought in the Dominican Republic on spring break my last year in college.  A resident of the house my friend and I stayed in played a native Dominican's CD everyday so it became the soundtrack to our visit.  The music is poorly produced and there are barking dogs used as part of the beat on one song, but that CD is probably the best souvenir I've ever gotten from a trip.  Sometimes, in summer, I'll put it on in my car; roll all the windows down and just drive, thinking of the Dominican.  There are many more CDs and even more recollections.  And so all these memories attached to my music cause the choosing of music to listen to at a particular time quite difficult.  There are rows and rows of CDs in my collection that I just can't bring myself to play because friends and trips and times in my life are gone and can't be reclaimed.  Nostalgia is sad state for me and one I only visit when I really miss someone or someplace.  And I'm so thankful when sometimes; somehow with new places and good friends I have the opportunity to attach new memories to the music.
that all the world should be taxed.  And so I went to a local tax place that was giving free tax service to teachers (gotta love those perks).  It took two nights because I had to wait the first night for another customer.  As I waited an older man who is a retired accountant and who's son owns the business began to organize my papers.  He was friendly and we talked for at least an hour.  Of course, he knew a lot about me because my life was displayed in numbers before him, but he also told me about his ex-wife who left him six months ago and all the improvements he had personally done on his house that he is now trying to sell.  While he was very kind and a great listener, this was all too much information, but I listened and nodded because he was helping me with finances.  When I left the first night after getting some of my information entered, I owed a boatload of taxes.  I was not happy and immediately began thinking of second jobs.  Barnes and Noble has been on my list for a while, but do I really want to work for a corporate monster at the lowest level?  OK, I'm a teacher, I really don't have much of a choice.  The next night was more promising, well financially at least.  When I walked in, the older man welcomed me and asked some more questions about my paperwork and then said he found a mistake the previous person had made that would save my taxes and actually grant me a return, a small one, but at least it was on the positive side.  I was ecstatic.  The clouds lifted and I would not have to sell my soul to pay my taxes.  He was quite pleased with himself as well and mentioned that he liked to see me smile more than three times.  I obliged him the smiles because he was, of course, saving my taxpaying ass.  This was a small outfit so all paperwork would be sent to a processing center to be checked and then I would have to come back to pick it up.  When I was ready to leave I went to shake his hand.  He held my hand well after the thank-you-for-your-help handshake and said 'The good news is that I get to see you one more time.'  I gave a quiet-I-don't-know-what-that-means giggle and turned and walked out.  As I left the store a scary thought went through my head, 'Did that old man just hit on me?'  He is not grandfather, really sweet older.  He's the just retired, wife just left me older.  Um, no.  I then began to think back to the conversations we had had over the past two nights.  Did he think there was more than accountant/ taxpayer information being past?    I have come to realize that I am clueless to men's flirting techniques, even when they are obvious.  This usually happens when there is no interest on my part and therefore why would I be looking for signs?  There was once the college friend who all of sudden told me he loved me.  I stopped being friends with him, pronto (I know, I'm a bitch, but he ended up gay so um, I think I was right).  There was a guy at a bar once who told me he had been staring at me and trying to pick me up for 1/2 hour.  I had no idea and I'm glad actually, he ended being quite cute and oh-so strange.  Then there was a guy at weekend long party who followed me around the whole first night until I realized after he told me that I was the kind of girl he wanted to marry that I really needed to just be around my girlfriends.  I hate those clueless girls, the ones who have guys swarming around them while they are supposedly oblivious.  I guess, sometimes we all are That Girl.  Regardless if the old tax-man was getting flirty or not, I can't help but feel that my tax refund is now just dirty money.
here's me trying to add linky links in the text for the first time.    urlLink buy an apple, it will save your life ,  urlLink good news ,  urlLink good TV ,  urlLink better TV ,  urlLink the best music ,   ok, i'm done with the practicing.  have fun with the linking.
So, the other day I was flipping through my sitemeter stats and noticed that someone came to my blog through google.  I clicked on the link to see what subject they entered to get here.  I like to see what other sites pop up along with mine.  Well, some perv entered 'pee together' into the google search engine.  My site came up becuase of my innocent story about my cousin and I when we were little.  I was totally grossed out.  People are disgusting.  I need a shower.
I just need a hug.  No, no, the biggest hug you have actually.  A giant teddy bear sized hug that envelopes me and cradles me and maybe even rocks me gently back and fourth.  A big hug, that's all.  Well, and maybe the answer to the question of 'Why?'
The work âdorkâ refers to the male sexual organ, âGeekâ was the name of a circus performer who bit the head off of chickens, and âjerkâ refers to the jerking motions that a person with severe cognitive or physical disabilities can display when they lose control of their muscles.  Sometimes, the words in our verbal lexicon are no so innocent.  Iâm just sayinâ.
âI gotta go,â I squealed.  I was 4 years old, skinny with dark hair, pale skin and big brown eyes.  âI gotta go too,â said B.  She was 5 years old, skinny with blond hair and brown eyes.  We were beautiful together, the little girl version of yin and yang.  âLetâs go together,â one of us said.  So we raced to the upstairs bathroom, got ready and sat down together to pee.  We were giddy.  This was silly.  We were peeing together, our tiny bottoms sharing one toilet.  Our mothers thought it was precious.  This was our cousin thing, a little girl bonding time.  One mother grabbed a camera and flashed our picture, B. with her long blond hair and legs together facing the bathtub, me with my long brown hair and legs together facing the wall.  We are squeezed in, our hands holding on to the tips of the oval seat so we wouldnât fall in or off.  Our clothes are simple knits, me in white, B. in dark blue; our shorts stuck to our legs have appliquÃ©.  We are gorgeous.  We are smiling.  We are young.  We are silly.  We are happy.  It is one of my favorite pictures, B. and I concocting a simple plan to kill two birds with one stone.  Iâm so glad there is a picture of that innocent time.  Sometimes B. and I will talk about our childhoods, how we grew up so differently yet share so much in common.  She is my blond size 2 cousin.  I am not her.  She is a modified hippie.  I am an ex-sorority girl.  Her mom is young and the least neurotic of her sisters.  My mom is not.  But we both have a factor in our blood that causes blood clots.  So do our mothers.  We are so different and so similar.  I am proud of her, that she is a brilliant photographer.  I love that she loves her animals and plants like they are her children.  Iâm glad she has found a man in a fairytale way, which we always dreamed would happen.  I love that she is strong and kind and knows more than she tells.  And I love that sometimes she will say, with laughter in her voice, âAnna, we use to pee together!â  âI know,â I say, laughing back, âI know.â
I  I donât remember his name, but I remember the first time I met Autism.  I was in college doing a very short practicum.  It was, in fact, my first practicum.  I was placed with a special education teacher at a local elementary school.  Her classroom served kids of varying disabilities, but mostly kids with LD or mild MR. She practiced âinclusionâ and this was my first experience with this hot topic in special education.  I observed her sitting at the back of a classroom with a small group of kids while the regular education classroom teacher led a lesson with the rest of the class.  âSo this is inclusion,â I thought.  âThis isnât what I had in mind, but I could do this.  OK, I get it.â  But, I would do more than observe over my 3 short visits to that school.  I asked the special education teacher if I could help her.  I wanted to get in there with the kids.  They were, after all, why I was there.  She asked me to sit with a little boy and read with him to keep him occupied for a short while.  His social skills were strange to me.  He came to me when I asked, but never looked at my face.  His eyes darted quickly from on thing to another, mostly at floor or knee level.  He sat down with me on a couch in a corner of the classroom.  He was the first to open the book and he just took off reading before I could tell him what we were going to be doing.  I had no time to ask him about the title, the author, or the pictures.  I was amazed that he could read the book verbatim to me.  He was in 1st or 2nd grade and I knew his true reading skills surpassed his supposed ability.  I asked him questions as we read the story.  I wanted him to explain or expand on the pictures in the book.  His answers were âyesâ or ânoâ if anything.  Mostly he ignored me.  It seemed he had no idea what we had shared together.  I remarked to his teacher later that I was very impressed with his reading, but wondered about why he couldnât or didnât answer my questions.  The teacher was busy and couldnât quench my inquisitions.    I was so uninformed and inexperienced with Autism.  That teacher couldnât have told me the answer to my questions.  Like Autism itself, the answers were complex.  II Mathew was four years old and on the flyer he had an angelic face with blond ringlets framing big blue eyes.  I answered the ad for a home-based teacher and began doing ABA therapy with Mathew in his home for 6 hrs. a week.  It took me only a few days to fall in love with him.  âThis is good work,â I thought.  âThis is what I was meant to do.â  I had another job that year in college working in the merchandise department for a famous band.  While I took phone orders and packed t-shirts all I could think about was Mathew and how the work with him was far more important than satisfying the sticker and CD wishes of teenagers.  I was anxious to stop working for the band and when summer ended I split my time between classes and Mathew.  I learned ABA well enough to do it in my sleep.  âWhat number? What letter?, Good job!, No, try again.â ran through my head, my dreams were flooded with discrete trials.    I worried about Mathew and whether I was really being effective.  I explained to friends and family that my work with Mathew was tedious.  I tried to put what we were doing into everyday language.  I said âWeâre trying to introduce him to our world, one thing at a time.â  I donât think my friends really grasped the idea, their puzzled faces said more than their encouraging words.  They feigned enthusiasm for my sake.  This was becoming my passion.    After a full year with Mathew I was tired of ABA.  Our sessions had become the same, the same drills, and the same goals.  I was bored.  I canât imagine what Mathew was feeling.  He was making progress, but not enough that I could make sense of it.  I had seen one major improvement in him.  I told my parents one night during dinner on their drive through my college town that Mathew had made gains and I was so excited.  I was seeing that he was understanding what we were teaching him.  The example I gave was this:  Everyday when I see him I say âHi Mathew,â and he answers âHi Annaâ usually with a flat affect and no eye contact.  I then say, âWhat are you doing?â  And there is silence.  I prompt him with âIâm sitting, Iâm playing Nintendo, Iâm reading a book, Iâm watching TV, Iâm eatingâ¦â He repeats my answer and I say âGood jobâ and we get to work.  Weâve done this a thousand times.  Itâs just the way I greet him, nothing specific we are working on.  Then one day around the 7th month into my work with him I walk into his room and say my stock greeting âHi Mathew.â âHi Anna,â he says.  âWhat are you doing?â  âIâm bed,â he says quietly.  I stopped in mid-stride then I flew to him, picked him up, threw him in the air saying, âThatâs right, youâre ON THE BED!  Good job!  I love it!â  I tickle him and we repeat the sequence, me shaping his words with a prompt. âIâm ON THE bed.â  This was a good day.  This was important.  He was understanding.  I would later learn in my education classes that Mathew had generalized the information we were teaching him.  He was âgetting it,â but I was happy for the reprieve and change of pace that student teaching brought when I had to stop working with Mathew.  I continued to baby-sit and stay close with the family, but this was my last experience with hard-core ABA.  It was the foundation for my obsession with Autism.  It was a good learning experience.  It was important.  III  The first day of my student teaching I knew things would be very different for me.  This was a TEACCH classroom.  What I walked into was a mess, a scattered and colorful maze of bookshelves and desks.  The teacher and TAs were just putting everything together after a summer off.  There was a relaxed feel and yet there was so much to do. The teacher was a graying hippie who wore overalls and Birkenstocks, drove a red pickup truck and talked about her horse, Nelly.  Sheâd developed the classroom and program with a fellow teacher.  This was her baby.  She knew Autism backwards and forwards.  She was wise.  I knew Iâd learn from her.  And I did.  The first day the kids arrived, 8 of them in all, I stood and watched and followed, mostly with my eyes and mouth wide open.  These kids talked in full sentences without prompting, the cared for their own belongings, they followed their own schedules, they played with typical peers, they asked for help, they were toilet trained.  âThis is not Autism,â is all I could think.  I talked with the teacher that first school day when all the kids had left.  I had a million questions about each child.  âWhy is Ethan so lethargic?  If Sadie didnât talk when you first met her, how did she learn to talk?  Will Kathleen ever read?â  I knew I had to get used to fact that Mathew was not Autism and Autism was not Mathew.  That classroom proved the spectrum for me in terms of kids, in terms of methodologies.  Autism is a rainbow of colors, I got it.  IV Anthonyâs parents came to school before school even began.  We had to amend his IEP.  He was switching schools to my newly formed Autism classroom and he would be held back in kindergarten for one more try.  His mother and father were originally from India.  They spoke English, but I still found myself speaking loudly and repeating things in simple phrases.  I needed to feel that they understood me because I couldnât understand them.  Anthonyâs first day in my classroom for kids with Autism was my first day too.  We both had no idea what we were in for.  Anthony would spend half a day in kindergarten sharing a TA with another student and half a day with me working academics and adaptive skills.  Anthony worked hard and was rewarded with playtime.  He spent a lot of him playtime having figures interact or simply talking gibberish to himself.  He knew English, but would only speak when prompted.  His parent assured us that they only spoke English at home.  This was important for him to learn one language given his challenges.  His parents were adamant and I believed them, they didnât understand him very much either.  He made no eye contact unless I cupped my hands around his big beautiful brown eyes and put him face to mine.  Anthony was a puzzle and he worried me.  Then, we began to acknowledge his sounds and anytime he used an English word appropriately we threw a small party.  Soon Anthony was throwing his own parties.  He would show us his artwork enthusiastically exclaiming, âLook.  Oh itâs beautiful.  Good job Anthony!â  When he would answer a question he would automatically congratulate himself, âYes, good job!â  We would agree with him and then laugh with him.  We knew he was repeating us, but we couldnât have paid for that pride or that growth.  We took it and embraced it, Anthony was awakening.  Slowly and surely Anthony made strides.  He quickly learned to read alongside his peers.  He was counting and making patterns.  His comprehension was always a bit of a challenge, but by 3rd grade he was working on grade level and fully included in his regular education classroom.  He even had friends.  Anthony was an exception.  He was bright and his parents worked with him constantly.  He is only one of many success stories, but his is one I think of often in terms of extremes.  His speech pathologist would often say to me when I was discouraged,  âAnna, when we tried to evaluate him his first year in kindergarten he was a mess.  He would sit in his classroom in the corner, rocking and saying gibberish.â    Turns out, there was no gibberish there, just words that needed shaping and a little boy who needed lots and lots of encouragement and laughter.  We happily gave it to him.   V  Autism is a neurological disorder that stems from deficits in social and communication skills and coincides with repetitive behaviors.  I often speak of Autismâs umbrella, how ADD and OCD and MR can all be part of a childâs diagnosis, but I always feel I fall short when explaining the true nature of the disorder.  This is hard for me because I canât possibly relay all the stories and images that had led to my understanding and yet without those stories and images my understanding is weak.  I want people to automatically see what I mean when I try to describe how this disorder can present itself and I am so careful that I donât leave a Rainman image, a one man show of a multi-faced disability.  I think I always fail; Rainman is more visual than my words can ever be.  And this too is what frustrates me when trying to explain my philosophy in educating people with Autism.  Contrary to my beginning with this disorder, I believe in a highly eclectic approach filled with speech therapy, occupational therapy, sensory integration, floortime, inclusion, schedules, behavior plans, varied opportunities, generalization, varied teaching materials and methods, all under a child centered, extremely structured environment.  And above all I believe in spontaneity with these students.  How can you be spontaneous in a highly structured environment?  Easy, make sure the structure allows for freedom and the kids will blossom.
I see the skyline of New York and my stomach does flips.  I want that city.  I crave that city.  When I unexpectedly come across a picture of New Yorkâs skyline, I take in the scene and then have to look away.  I canât look too long because the stomach flip will turn into an aching.  So, I move on and begin to plan a trip back to Gotham.   Iâve only visited on short trips.  Sometimes my visits were so brief they were merely a tease.  A one-nighter for a private concert, a one-night lay over to the Dominican, and a lunch on Spring Street in January with snow falling while passing through town.  No matter the time Iâve spent in NYC, the city is always with me.    This past December I told my friend shortly after we emerged from Penn Station that I just felt at home in the city.  There is so much life in New York and this is what I love must about it.  Of course there is life everywhere, but in NYC it is at its most vibrant.  I love that there are people crashing into you on the sidewalks.  I love that you can hear the streets and sirens at 4am on the 25thfloor of an apartment building.  I love the subways and buses carrying strangers to a million different places.  I love that there is a giant patch of green in the middle of the chaos to offer a reprieve and that inside that escape the skyline still impresses its buildings, gesturing to come back into the fray.  I consume as much media related to New York as I can.  I watch every documentary I find, rent movies with that take place in New York, read books with NYC as the setting, and read blogs of NYC dwellers.  Obsession would be a good word for it, but my fascination is more of a hobby.  I think about moving there and then life goes on and I forget about it or convince myself that itâs not really what I want, that I need to cultivate the roots here and stay near my family whom I love.  But, when I see a picture of New Yorkâs skyline, my stomach tells me to go back to the obsessing, to get online and find a job and an apartment in the city, to forget the ties in Virginia and to make that leap.  I know, I know.  Why not?  Well, I have no answer.  All I can say is give me a year, weâll see.
the fever is breaking which is a good thing, but i would rather be cold than sweating.  thanks to my friend, j., in texas who urged me to go out and get sick food.  i was so hot, but my belly is full and that is a good thing, however eating salad while breathing through your mouth is a hard thing to do and not choke.  i'm just sayin'.  i'm done with the sick updates, go back to your lives people, i'll be blowing my nose and turning up my AC.
been under a down comforter for an hour and a half and still freezing.  body hurts, fever at 100.something.  want. my. mom. and. gingerale and orange sherbert float.
I hate having a cold, especially when the weather is warm.  My head is clogged and nose is stuffed.  I just want my bed.  HMMMMM, my bed.  Must. Get. To. Bed.  Right after some meetings at school with parents who probably won't show up and I'll just be sitting around twittling my thumbs and wishing for my bed.  2 of my 3 meetings scheduled for this morning already didn't happen.  2 more non-meetings to go, then home and bed and tv and orange juice.
Check out the new link on the right, 100 things.  and thanks.
At one point during every season, save for summer, I think that this season is my favorite time of the year.    I love the point in fall when the leaves have turned their autumnal colors and there is a crispness to the air that only happens in late September and early October.  Fall smells like new backpacks and fresh notebooks.  For me, fall signals beginnings though most of nature is ending or falling into a slumber.   Winter brings the snow that quiets and cleanses everything under its blanket, and this usually brings rest from the harried school days.  I love the cold and chilled air of winter, sleeping under a thickly feathered duvet and throwing on handmade scarves to snuggle my neck.      My favorite thing about spring are the honeysuckle flowers.  Spring sneaks up on me every year.  I grow use to the barren trees of winter and somehow donât notice the buds and tinges of green that Spring pushes through.  Then one day, all of a sudden, there are no more branches on the trees, hillsides cascade with green, houses are hidden behind rows or clumps of leaves and flowers, and shade gracefully covers the precious areas under the trees' new dress.    But, honeysuckle.  It's an amazing testament of re-growth.  It grows wild along highways, alleys, schoolyards, and backyards, any place with a fence to lend climbing space.  The bushes are everywhere and when a small honeysuckle breeze blows and catches me off guard I am seven again, standing in my front yard on the left side of the house near the alley with my brother and neighborhood friends.  The bushes are full grown and you can't be outside without the sweetness luring you.  We would gather round the bushes picking the yellow and white flowers as quickly as we could.  We wanted as much sweetness as we could get, but we were hindered by our work.  Stealing honeysuckle juice is a delicate task.  You must be careful to pluck the whole flower from the bush.  Then gently holding the flower midway up the petals between two fingers on one hand, you pinch the bottom green mass between two fingers on the other hand and pull.  The pulling must be slow.  You must feel the tiny yellow ball at the end of the delicate stem slipping through the petals, grabbing and pushing the honey out of the small hole you've made in the flower.  Then quickly move the flower and stem to your tongue a moment before you pull the stem from the flower and feel the tiny tickle of sweet, watery honey.  It's spring.  Your tongue has confirmed it.  Life is beginning again.
I was strolling through B&N one day and noticed that in the SAT prep section there were new materials, which were not part of my SAT study path.  I had a tinge of jealousy seeing 'SAT word' novels on the shelf.  The titles like BUSTED and HEAD OVER HEELS accompanied cheesy cover art and promised stories of love and mystery among high school students.  These 'novels' are written around common vocab. words found on the SAT and those words even appear in bold type within the text.  I was jealous because even though I have a BA in English Lang. and Lit. and love to read, I hated and struggled with reading throughout elementary, middle and high school.    My majoring in English was a surprise even to myself because I entered college loathing reading and writing.  I even went to the writing center on campus to get assistance with my early college papers and I would come out knowing I had much work ahead of me.  I was originally going to major in Psychology thinking that I needed this background for teaching.  But, my heart was never in Psychology and when one of the best professors I ever had gave me a C, it pushed me to make a change.    He was one of the best professors, not because of his teaching, but because of our talks during my office visits.  I went to him often for help because I was failing his class.  He became my friend and gave me guidance.  I learned about his family and his struggles in college and he helped me see that my world was not, in fact, collapsing around me.  We didn't talk much about the class I was taking from him, these were more like therapy sessions.  The strange thing about his role in my life that semester (and even later when I would go and visit with him) is that his specialty was in learning and cognition and he worked primarily with mice.  He wasn't trained for the sessions we had and when he handed me chemwipes as I cried during my first visit, I knew he would be my friend.    After a few sessions in his office, the semester was ending and it was time for the final exam.  I rocked the socks off of my final, but he still gave me a C for the course, I was one point away from a B- and passing the class.  I was heartbroken and felt betrayed. When I went to see him after winter break to discuss my grade, he didn't flinch although he had previously and quietly said he would help me if I made a good enough grade on the final.  I left his office quietly and quickly that day, there was no therapy session to work me through this one and I wasn't that upset, surprisingly.  He knew what he was doing; he knew my heart was not in Psychology.  With the threat of having to retake that Psychology class to finish the major looming in the distance, I went on with my other classes.  While studying THE EPIC OF GILAMESH for an anthropology class with a friend, I realized I had to change my major.  I loved the analysis of psychology, but I hated the science of it.  English, this is where I could find the analysis I craved without any science to confuse my brain.  I crammed every English class available into my schedule.  I stuck to mostly poetry classes as I thought this was my passion.  I think part of me really liked how short poems where.  I was still a little afraid of all that reading.  But, I couldn't avoid it forever and I'm so glad that I had to read books like A RAISIN IN THE SUN, AS I LAY DYING, DROWN, NATIVE SON, CYMBELINE, THE COLOR PURPLE, and THE BLUEST EYE.    I wasn't the best at reading all the assigned readings.  'Sir Gawain' and Chaucer didn't excite me and there were Colonial American passages that put me to sleep, literally.  I still struggle with my love/ hate relationship with reading.  I wish I were voracious at it.  I think it's partly that it takes time for stories to unfold.  I wish I could finish books in one sitting like a movie, but I read slowly.  I read every word and say each one silently in my head.  I know there are speed-reading methods, but I don't want to skip over words, I just wish I could read every word, faster.    A few years ago, I started a book journal where I write character maps and synopses of the books I read.  It's an idea from my 10th grade English teacher and I find it good for me.  I have physical proof that I've read a book and it jogs my memory if I can't remember a plot line or character details.  In the beginning of the journal I noted words I needed to look up, big words not in my daily vocab.  This lasted for about 3 books (OK just 1 really) and then the words I didn't know disappeared from the entries as if I've mastered the English Lang.  Hardly, I just got lazy, realizing I probably would never use or see those big words again and just began to skim over them.  But, sometimes, I crave bigger words in my head and I wonder if I read 'SAT vocab.' novels, would I cognize the context clues, ascertain the definitions and ameliorate my conversations?  I doubt it.
Tonight going to my good friend's house to watch the finale of friends (um finally, thank God) I was driving to the middle of nowhere.  I hate the suburbs and she and her fiance live so far out that it takes 30 minutes and $2.50 in tolls roundtrip from my apartment in town.  So driving, I saw this mini cooper with the license plate 'SUVS SUC.'  Now, I know we guzzle gas and are ruining the ozone, but I really wanted to pull his little mini ass over and challenge him to play chicken with my SUV.  I'd squash him.  He'd be like a crumple soda can after slamming into my Sport (luxury) Utility (hauling shoes and pretty purses) Vehicle.  So, you mini man, watch who you're picking on.   And my best friend is getting married and sometimes this makes me cry.  Like tonight, it finally hit me and I cried.    PS-  I love mini coopers, being obsessed with all things British.  But, don't mess with my SUV!
Of course I've thought about it happening.  I've envisioned how it would happen and what I might do.  I've considered that I should devise a plan if it happened, just to be prepared.  Well, it happened and I had no plan, no diagram to show me what to do.    This morning I woke up with a headache thinking, as I do every morning, that I just want to get back in bed, I want to call in sick.  But, I never do call in sick.  I turn on the coffee maker, get dressed, fix lunch and when the coffee is ready I begin sipping it while quietly saying a prayer that my empty stomach will except the legal stimulate and take it straight to my brain.  This morning, the coffee couldn't work fast enough and the headache required 2 ibuprofen.  Praying to the over-the-counter drug gods that the medicine too would go straight to my brain, I began looking for my keys.  I couldn't find them and my head hurt too much to search really hard.  So I grabbed the spare set with it's spare car key, spare car remote clicker thing, and spare apartment key.  The clicker thing was the slightly used one I had traded for the unused one a few months ago thinking that the battery in it had run itâs course.  It's a sad little keychain with only the three danglers, but it would have to do, I was running late.    It was a wet morning and this time I remembered my spare umbrella in case the heaven's opened up on me as I went from school to school.  I stepped out of my apartment, coffee in hand and as I approached my car, the spare clicker wasn't working.  I figured its tiny battery was in fact dead and opened the driver's side door with my key.  I then tried to manually unlock the rear doors by using the power unlock button on the driver side door (I know, not really manually).  Nothing happened.  I was confused.  I hopped in, put my bags on the passenger seat, set my coffee in its holder and put the key in the ignition.  Upon turning it, I got nothing.  I mean nothing, not even the usual piddily sound the altenater makes when itâs trying to charge the battery when in fact the battery is dead.  All signs were pointing to a dead battery, but no noise, that was strange.  I was confused and then remembered how the ignition had been acting funny the last few days.    Here is where I needed the plan and had none.  I first said a quick thank you to God that I was a support teacher and did not have a classroom full of kids waiting on me and then a bit of panic set in.  What do you when you are almost late for work as it is and everyone you know is probably at work already.  I called my brother, he had to take the kids to school and even if he could get me to work I couldnât travel to my other schools and I'd have to take care of the car today anyway.  So, I had to call in.  I was getting my early morning wish, but really, this was not the way I had wanted it.  Having no plan I couldnât figure out how to call in: Do I call in sick or is this personal business?  Do I call in for a half day and hope my brain clears and I figure out how to get to school for the last half of the day?  Who can help me?  How long with AAA take?    I ended up calling in for the whole day.  Car troubles have notoriously taken whole days before so I thought I would play it safe and not confuse the day even more by having to try to get to school by a certain time.  It all worked out.  The dealership was able to (expensively) fix everything by the end of the day and I can go to school easily and safely again.  I'm just wondering, do you have a plan if it happens to you?
This past weekend I went to Winston-Salem, NC to a cousin's wedding, on my dad's side.  I am not close to this side of my family; my dad having only brothers and brothers are less likely to gather their respective families together often enough for children to form bonds.  I do see my cousin A. every Thanksgiving at our house though I don't really know her.  She is, however, sweet and kind and so I was happy to go to her wedding.  I was, however, happier to also spend time with my Cousin Loves A. and R. from my mother's side.  My mother has two sisters and while both live in different cities in North Carolina, all of our families have grown up together.  We have spent almost every holiday together, camping vacations at the beach, and weeks at Lake Norman, NC.  My cousin's and I (a total of 3 girls and 1 boy) haven't always been great friends, but we were great playmates growing up.  We were around each other so much that it seemed like we were brothers and sisters.  We played, we fought, we played again, and then we went to college.  When we grew older we became friends.  Trips to visit each other and weekly phone calls developed.  We became good friends, we were happy our mothers brought us together, we were happy for our Cousin Love.  Cousin Love is how we address each other and we do it with a southern drawl.  It ends up sounding like 'cuzzin luuuuv.'  It is merely a way to say, 'I'm glad you're in my life.  I'm glad youâre my cousin and I love you.'    Cousin Loves have begun to multiply.  There are now wives and soon-to-be husbands and I'm sure there will be children soon too.  We welcome the additions and affectionately extend the Cousin Love name.  Our children will continue to be cousins though growing more and more distant in a familial since.  We know they will grow up together, we hope too that they will develop innocent Cousin Love and see the joy of friendship that we have.  We have a tentative plan to save our monies and buy a beach house.  We want to name it Cousin Love, but know that the world would think us odd.  So, in Spanish it would be 'Primo Amor.'  And in Italian, it also means 'first love' and this sounds good to us.  So, this past Friday night, after the rehearsal dinner for A.'s wedding I took my newly found cousin from my father's side over to A. and R.'s house for some quality time.  It was fun, good drinks, good conversation.  It was like we had all been friends forever.  It was what Cousin Love is all about.  And my cousin R. from my dad's side blended right in.  In fact, we've convinced her to come to Thanksgiving this year, to continue and expand the Cousin Love.  The Cousin Love was so good I felt full up, full up of the kind of love that lets your know you have all you need in the world.  The next night at A.'s wedding I sat with my mom and dad, my dad's cousins, one of my dad's brothers, and my cousin R. as we watched A. and B. swish around the room.  They did their prescribed wedding things: the first dance as husband and wife, the father-daughter dance, the cake cutting, and the throwing of the garter.  As I watched them cut the cake I felt full up again.  I felt no envy of A. and B. at that moment.  There was no sense that I was missing something.  I realized then that I love my family, I love my life, and I am happy.  Full up, indeed.
How do we meet them?  When do we know they will be important in our lives?  What are the signs that certain people are meant to change you, permanently?    This weekend I found a good friend, and luckily, she is part of my family.  At our mutual cousin's wedding we met again after probably 15 years.  I don't even remember the last time I saw her but it was probably at our North Carolina family reunion, eating chicken stew cooked in a large cast iron kettle over an open flame.  Surrounded by family I didn't know very well and in the mist of teenage angst I guess I didn't realize what an amazing person R. would grow to be.  Funnily too, we lived an hour away from each other at one point in college and never made the trip over the mountains to meet.    R. currently lives in NYC pursuing her passion, poetry.  Sheâs been through college, graduate school and now another masters degree for writing.  She's lived almost a whole life since we last talked and I guess, I have too.  We talked about NYC and my passion for that city and about poetry.  We have more in common than I can believe.  She is someone I wish had always been in my life and she was, I just didn't know it.  The cousin's wedding whom we were celebrating was brought about through similar circumstances.  A. and B. had gone to high school together, but didn't run in the same circles.  They both went on to college and jobs and lived in various other cities then met again a few years ago while both were back in their hometown.  Their friends say that A. and B. are perfect together, they compliment each other, and that they are deeply in love.    Why does it take years, sometimes lifetimes to realize that people who surround you are the ones that will compliment you in ways you can't even fathom?  It is as if we are not ready at times.  Friends, lovers, husbands, and wives may pass us along the street, but until we have fully grown into ourselves, it doesn't matter how often we meet.  When we are ready, hopefully they will be there.  It's as if we are all just ships passing in the night and I'm so thankful when somehow we meet again and our lives begin a new direction.
My parents are here.  They are taking care of me which is nice since the tetanus shot has ruined my left arm, I got a splinter in my good foot hopping around, and all of my muscles are sore from having to be used all of a sudden in ways they are not used to.  Anyway, enough of the moaning and groaning, I should be half-walking in a few days.    My family is taking me to the beach to be waited on.  I canât go in the sun with the antibiotics that Iâm on and I canât get my foot wet.  Itâs all good; I donât like the sand and saltwater anyway.  So, Iâm off for a week.  Iâm being driven 4 hours to sit in a house and have people bring me things.  Iâll be knitting up a storm and reading and watching my little nieces and nephew play.  I wish I could play with them.  So, no blogging for a week.  Come back, Iâm sure Iâll have lots to say when I return to you as long as you return to me.
And it seems I should have stayed there.  The infection is way better today, but I was really groggy from the vicodin this morning.  I had to take it last night to sleep through the pain.  Then, this morning, I went to fix some eggs and toast and just when I was going to put the food on the plate I stepped on a blade that had fallen from a cabinet that I forgot about and didnât see.  I sliced my foot wide open and now have 6 stitches.  Iâve never had stitches and I was not the best patient for the poor doctor.  This has been a rough two days.  Iâm going to bed and please donât call cause I can't walk to get the phone.
So, I have an infection and from 6 to 10:45pm was in some SERIOUS pain.  I went to a prompt care place nearby and pretty much cried the whole time as the pain got worse and worse.  I thought about not going, about toughing it out.  I donât like to look like a hypochondriac, but after phone calls to mom and the worsening of the pain, I couldnât not go.  Iâve never seen any of the staff before and I went by myself so Iâm sure the staff saw this crying girl and was like âOk, whatâs going on there?â  As they sent me from the bathroom to x-ray room to testing room and 2 people walked in on me undressing then dressing, I cried.  I cried around the nurse, the doctor, the x-ray tech.  I winced and moaned and squirmed like I was having a baby.  Iâm not a crier and as a woman I can handle pain in the abdominal area pretty well.  I couldnât stop the tears, the pain was too much.  So, after all the testing (and crying), the doctor on call gave me a bottle of vicodin.  I think he felt sorry for me.  Iâve taken the other meds, but not the vicodin yet.  That powerful a drug scares me.  And, thanks to the beautiful power of antibiotics (we are talkinâ serious ones here) and gentle Tylenol, I can walk and sit without moaning.  I love medicine.  I love doctors.  And, Iâm sure if I take the vicodin, Iâll love you too.
Yesterday, the phone rang while I was brushing my teeth.  Mouth full or foam and sonic still buzzing, I run around looking for my cell phone.  When I locate it deep in the depths of my purse I donât recognize the number and think that I need to answer it quickly.   And then, like a dumbass, I do.  My muffled âhelloâ allows the person on the other end to identify himself.  While he does so Iâm thinking âWhat do I do now?  I canât talk like this.  Do I swallow it (ew) or spit while heâs on the phone.  What. The. Hell?â  I decide on spitting and just confess it, heâs already heard me sound as if Iâm under water.  So I say âHold on, Iâm brushing my teeth,â then go to the sink to spit, sonic turned off but still in my hand.  I apologize to him when I return and hope that he didnât hear me spitting in the sink, 3 feet away from the phone.  I realize; what a dumbass, like answering the phone at that moment was so important that it superseded the mouth full of water and paste.  What, what was I thinking?  Sometimes, I wonder.
Iâve realized it is real work being a girl.  The maintenance is insane and usually I am not great at making regular appointments for the filing and plucking and cutting and tweezing and polishing.  I usually get things done on a whim or because I canât take the jungle growing above my eyes anymore.  Home upkeep is far cheaper, but I am far from skilled enough to keep it up.  I try for a few weeks and then I have to revert to the professionals.   Iâve never really been the kind to have one hairdresser that I go to excusively.  A college roommate would travel 45 minutes back home to get her hair done and still goes to the same lady today though now the commute is about an hour or more.  I donât understand that.  Sure, a good hairstylist is hard to find, but there are several out there, in every city.    Iâve never had a fear of the haircuts either.  Iâve walked into salons for the first time and told the stylist to just do whatever they wanted to do.  Some stylists like this, others, not so much.  I havenât really ever had a bad experience.  One hairdresser said that I didnât have to worry about my hair framing my face while other women used their hair to enhance their features and thus the anxiety they have.  I think she was complimenting me.  She also gave me one of the best haircuts and I ended up going back to her a few times.  In the 10 months that I've lived in Richmond I've had my hair cut three times by three different people, none were bad, but none were exceptional either.  Today, my stylist was Daniel, a thin man with spiked dirty blond hair who smelled like cigarettes and herbal shampoo.  I was apprehensive at first for a man to be plucking my eyebrows and cutting my hair and then he spoke and walked.  There is something comforting about a gay man being in charge of your beauty needs.  I told him I just needed a trim and he guided me to a sink then said weâd do the eyebrows first so we went to back room with a comfy bedlike chair.  He worked on my eyebrows longer than most women stylists have.  He plucked the small thin straggling hairs at the top corners of my brows and only put the wax on once.  He massaged the areas wear he had waxed and plucked.  He relaxed me.  He took his time and care.     I was disappointed that he didnât massage my head when he shampooed my hair.  I expected he was an extended massager, he wasnât.  As we walked to his styling chair I wanted to tell him to do whatever he wanted with my hair, to put his spin on it.  As he was combing out I my hair, I wanted to tell him to be creative, do what he thought was best for my face.  I never did.  I sat quietly and watched the other customers.  He never asked how much I wanted taken off.  He just took my hair and started cutting.  He cut it to a healthy length, parted it down the middle and added subtle layers.  He did this without asking or telling me.  He cut and cut and cut, the layers taking time and many head tilts.    When he was finished cutting he put straightening cream and hair gel into my wet hair and blew it dry using a rolled brush to straighten and turn the ends under, a skill I can never get down.  He didnât talk much, nor did I, but when he did he said things like ârock and rollâ and âtwisted.â  With these words, I realized we couldnât be friends.    Hours after meeting him, he lingers.  When my hair swishes or I brush it out of my face, I smell him, cigarettes and herbs.  In the time that I walked in looking for a simple trim and walked out with a hairstyle, Daniel became my hairdresser.  Iâm committing to him like no other man.  I know at least he will take his time and care and he'll give me what I need without even asking.
For weekâs I have been wondering when exactly Fatherâs Day is.  I know of course, that itâs in June and on a Sunday.  But I feel like it moves around from year to year.  I have, however, just learned that itâs always the 3rd Sunday of June each year.  Hmm, I really have trouble with dates.  Iâm horrible at birthdays.  Actually, horrible is probably not strong enough a word.  My best friend and I will often send birthday cards that are 6 months late.  But, we know thatâs the way it is and we accept it, wholeheartedly.  Others, however, are not so kind.  Iâve known people to really get offended by others forgetting their birthdays.  Thatâs just damn selfish in my opinion.  I donât know.  Iâm not a big birthday celebrator and never really have been.  Iâm trying to get better at it, but dates elude me.  Like today, I was reading my daily blogs when   urlLink Jennifer Weinerâs post  mentionâs fatherâs day and I have one of those âOh my God, Iâve got to call my Dadâ moments.  I ran around looking for my cell phone and as Iâm talking to my Dad I realize that I have not sent a card or anything.  I quickly realize I will try to remedy the situation next week at family beach week, but still shitty, shitty of me.  I sent my Mom a Momâs day card (a day late of course), but nothing for my old Dad, who loves me so unconditionally.  Sorry Dad.  Itâs not personal, I just suck.  Well, I guess in my case, weâve established why there is no Daughterâs Day.  On the bright side, maybe the Fatherâs Day cards will be half-price tomorrow.
Cellophane.  Itâs my new favorite wrapping material.  Iâve just wrapped 2 presents for todayâs scheduled parties and yes, one is wedding related and yes, Iâm over it.  As I went through my quite vast assortment of wrapping material I landed on the cellophane for the first package because I had to due to itâs odd shape and then I just had to us the cellophane again for the next one, itâs just too fun.  And, while wrapping, I walked around singing âCellophane, Mister cellophaneâ from Chicago.  And now, Iâm just chillinâ before I have to leave to drive all over Virginia in one day.  Iâm usually a last minute shopper and would typically be out buying the presents right now. But, Iâve learned to stockpile presents so that I can just pull from the bunch and go.  But, my last minuteness is not totally gone, Iâm really waiting on my clothes in the dryer and I was suppose to leave like 5 minutes ago.  Oh well, people love me anyway, despite all the lateness and last minute presents, tags still on.  I am, in fact, not Miss Cellophane cause you gotta notice the girl who is fashionably late.
Last night, at about 9:30 I had the bright idea of going to see âRaising Helen.â  Some friends had already seen it and since I had no work the next day I could handle to the late night showing at 9:55.  So, I hopped in the car and raced to the West End to the stadium seats.  It was me, and three couples.  Wonderful, nothing like smug couples on a Thursday night date.  Whatever.  I took my own row, settled in and put my feet up.  I love the movies.  I started going to movies alone about 5 years ago when in college an impossibly popular co-worker divulged her love of going to movies on her own.  I was appalled and shocked.  Why in the hell would a 20 year-old, blond, size 2, charming, and smart girl ever go to the movies by herself?  She explained that her mother did it and that she liked it.  She would often be shopping and find a movie on and just go.  I thought she was brave.   It took me a good year before I braved the movies alone.  It must have been uneventful, as I donât even remember the movie that ended my solo movie going virginity.  Now, I donât even think twice about it and yet I think Iâm still a bit of a rebel in the venture.  I donât think my friends do this.  I even have a friend who doesnât like to rent movies alone. Movie watching is a solitary act anyway, unless, of course, you are at home snuggled up on a couch.  So, if a movie is out that I want to see and no one else does, or Iâm near a movie theatre and see something interesting, or Iâm bored at home and need to do something other than stare at myself, Iâll go to a movie, alone.  No big deal, it just happens.  So, last night was âRaising Helen.â    Sad bit of a movie if you ask me.  The plot was weak and lame and not well thought out.  There were scenes were I literally wanted to rewind and rewrite and then there were the ever present continuity issues where the clothes in one scene are the same in the next scene although itâs a different day.  This movie overall has bad writing, bad editing, and not really great acting although I still adore Kate Hudson, John Corbett, and Joan Cusak.  What were they thinking?  Anyway, good premise, just not well done.  And, Iâm beginning to rethink things about my friends who said it was âso cute.â     And then, because I could, I went Wal-marting at midnight.  I stepped into the Wal-mart at 12:15am and spent the next 45 minutes shopping the supper center.  It was fabulous and surreal.   Tons of people were about, mostly Wal-mart workers restocking the shelves and a few customers.  There were boxes everywhere, which you had to navigate around.   The restockers would sometimes give me weird glances like it was crazy that I was bargain shopping in the middle of the night on a Thursday.  Please, like itâs not weird that you are working at Wal-mart in the middle of the night.  Yarn was had because well, the kitting has not stopped.  And then, because I could, I got some fresh produce and checked out at 1am.  Wonder if that is what Sam Walton envisioned for his supper store?
So, I went to the doctor yesterday to get a mole checked out.  Since I had blistering sunburn 10 years ago, I have been cautious with suspicious items on my skin.  Turns out that melanoma does not necessarily strike the area that was burned (interesting).  And the mole or whatever seems to be nothing (thank God).  This was my first visit to this doctor in Richmond so I had to fill out all the info. sheets and sign away my life, literally.  Well, since it was the last day of school I had a little trouble leaving when I wanted to and then when I got to the hospital there was an unexpected game of chicken for the limited parking spaces.  So, I finally grab one and walk quickly through the soupy, muggy air (wearing jeans no less) and make it to the fourth floor about 7 minutes late for the appointment.  I get my papers and sit down.  I write and write and then pause to actually read the clauses before I sign them when the receptionist moves the glass plate that blocks out the waiting area (um, itâs glass people, we can still see and hear you) and this is what she says âMiss Banana, the nurse is waiting for you because she was expecting you at 3:30.  Can you write faster because youâre late?â  âYeah, OK,â I say.  And then it dawns on me that I should have stood up on a chair or something and announced to the waiting area âHi, my name is Anna and Iâll be late today.â
I woke up early this morning to a fog, a thick fog over the city.  It nestled in the trees in the courtyard of my apartment building.  It was tranquil and quieted the morning like a blanket of snow.  I haven't seen a fog in years, probably becuase I sleep through them.  But today, the fog  mimiced the fog I've been under for the last few days.  Not a bad fog, just a mindless, in a daze fog where I leave important, confidential documents on a copier, don't put an important piece of info. into folders, can't comprehend questions asked of me, can't understand what I am reading. I've been in a haze but, now, it's mid-day and the fog is gone, the sun has burned it away.  It's the last day for teachers, my files are completed, I've helped other teachers clean up their rooms and mail letters home.  School is out.  We're done.  One year down, a million more to go.  But, for now, for the summer, I'm free.  Plans for the beach, LA, and NYC are being made, and of course all the weddings.  Happiness abounds with the sunshine raining down.  Pool days and sleeping in and reading books and unexpected trips and movies and relaxation and freedom.  It's good to be a teacher when it's summer in the city.
Sex and The City on TBS. The girls are back.  Fall in love people, all over again.
And by that I mean Knitters Anonymous because I am addicted.  I decided to pick up knitting again this weekend and have so far knitted 2 scarves and begun three more.  I'm obsessed.  I even raced after school to a knitting store that closes at four so that I could buy way too much yarn for half price.  But, at least my friends will nice have nice yarn in their scarves instead of the Walmart brands.  I want to constantly be knitting.  I've even started knitting in bed with no lights on.  That's right, knitting in the dark, sexy.  And yesterday, I had to refrain from taking the knitting to the bathroom with me.  Knitting is on the brain so much that it's all I think about (at least for the last few days).  Like, when I'm at work or out with friends I keep thining 'I really wish I had my knitting right now.  I really want to finish that scarf.'  It's like I need a bumper sticker that says I'D RATHER BE KNITTING.  And no, there is no purling, just kniting and knitting and knitting.  See the obsession, it's bad and well, I need to get back to the needles and the yarn.   Tonight was yet another wedding related event, a surprise semi-shower for the friend and co-teacher.  Enough with the wedding stuff already.  The showers and the bachelorette parties and the girl's weekends and the weddings.  I mean there is no money left, the well is dry.  I'm really going to be weddinged out by November.  'Dear Lord, make me a bird so I can fly far far away.  Dear Lord, make me a bird so I can fly far far away.'  Or maybe, I'll just bring my knitting and then it will all be bareable.
Woke up around 11:30 which really not that late, but considering it was drunk sleep, it was far to early.  Too much bachelorette partying.  My head hurt and I felt like a ton of bricks hit me so back to bed I went at 2 pm for a long nap.  I don't even know how I got that drunk or if I was that drunk.  I didn't drink that much, although people were handing us shots all night, but those fruity shots don't have much alcohol in them.  And, I had my wits about me at the end of the night.  I was probbably the most sobber one there.  So, what the hell with the hangover?  Anyway, it's currently 5pm and I need to get on with my day, or what's left of it.
Itâs summer, well almost and not officially, but heat wise; it is summer in the city.  Poor Virginia, it is plagued with humidity and hot summers.  I know our summers are not like Texas summers or Louisiana summers, but they are hot enough for me.  I donât believe in snootiness, but sometimes I wish I were a person who âsummersâ somewhere else if just to get away from the nastiness.  Maine, Maine sounds good, or maybe even Canada.    The only thing really good about the heat is that pools open and there are trips to natural bodies of water.  Every year my family takes a beach trip. I actually hate sand and saltwater, but I love the laziness of a beach week.  I take about ten books and I just read and play with children and read some more.  And then there is, of course, the eating of the shrimp and crab.  There is always the eating of the shrimp and crab.  But, before and after the beach, there is the pool.  Growing up we belonged to our local Elks Club, an organization I really donât understand except that there were usually old men there at any given time throughout the day and they could be found at the bar inside the clubhouse.  Iâve never found out what the organization stood for or against and as soon as the last child (me) went to college, my fatherâs membership ran out.  We used the place for the pool and the pool only.  The local pool, a place where you learn to swim from the coolest man you have ever seen because he wears sunglasses underwater, where you strengthen friendships over adult swim breaks and during âsharkâ in the deep end, and where you tackle the fear of the âhigh dive.â  I never joined the swim team, but I was a lifeguard for 2 summers.  Lifeguarding is the best job ever invented.  Sometimes I think about going back to lifeguarding with my summers off, but then I think that the current 16 year olds would find me a bit strange and I would certainly not fit into their lifeguarding clique.  Thatâs OK.  I got my lifeguarding kicks back in the day anyway.  I just really miss the twirling, the twirling of the whistle while sitting in the tall chair with a high vantage point, the sun so strong you can see your legs tanning before you eyes.  The pool is now what I go to with my nieces and nephew.  None know how to swim yet, but I am determined to solve that one.  My favorite thing to do with them is to take each one, individually, in my arms and pull them across the pool from the shallow to the deep end.  On the cross-pool treks, our faces close together, we pretend different things, sometimes they practice kicking or just floating.  When water rushes into their mouth and nose I know itâs a 50/50 chance of them quitting the trek mid-pool.  But, the other day, my precious niece coughed it out and swallowed hard then said, in three year-old voice, âAnnie, I want to ride the waves again.â  You see, we were pretending to be on the ocean and waves were gently bouncing us up and down (hence the water in the nose from the crashing wave).  I love the pool.  I love that it turns a three year-old into a chlorine swallowing wave rider.
There is this guy I know, but he shall remain nameless, although I might be related to him.  I adore this guy.  He is one of the funniest people I know and whenever I am around him I know that we will be laughing so hard that we fall over.  However, last night I discovered he is the biggest dork I know.  And this is why.    We both love Apple.  We are both obsessed with Apple.  Like last week I emailed him about the new  urlLink Apple Airport Express  and he emails me back and is like âI was reading about it just when you emailed.â  And then the next day he calls me and we chat for like half an hour about how the world really needs to know that Apple is so superior and really people would be happier if they just owned an Apple and businesses were run on Apples.  We discover it is a futile attempt, but our love for Apple will never die.  This guy is a certified Windows programmer and even interviewed for a job at Microsoft so his love for Apple is even more special than mine.  He converted about 4 years ago and has not looked back since.  In fact, heâs a little pissed at people who like PCs.  He loves Apple so much that he gets magazines about Apple and somehow is in the loop of rumors about the new products they are creating. I know there are rumor websites and he probably surfs them.  Itâs all a business related obsession since he programs all day. I have to confess that if I understood all that computer jargon, I would be in on it too.  I just donât have time to learn all that stuff about computers, I just know I love Apple.  I also know that he is my Apple lovin' hero and he is there to dispense knowledge should I have a technical quetions.  He rocks my Apple lovin' world.    Well, so last night he was telling me about the last issue of  urlLink Mac World .    urlLink Alton Brown gave an interview and developed a special recipe to celebrate Apple.  The name of the dish is APPLE MACaroni and Cheese.  âEw,â he said.  âYeah, weird,â I said.  Then, this guy that I adore,went on to tell me that at the last Mac Expo (or whatever) when Steve Jobs gave his closing statement, he had a friend over to his house during their lunch hour and they watched it on the internet while eating MACaroni and then for dessert they had APPLEsauce.  Oh, dear one, I still, still, adore the hell out of you!
Ronald Regan's body will be lying in state on Thursday at the capitol in DC.  Iâm thinking about going.  Although I donât really have the money to spend on gas, when will I ever get to see a president lying in state in the near future?  And really itâs not about the pomp and circumstance, itâs about Ronnie.    Heâs the only president I feel personally connected to and itâs not about his politics or his cuddly nature and love for his wife or that even a president can be human and have family problems too.  Itâs about birthdays.  You see, ole Ronnie and I have the same birthday.  Big deal you say, you also share it with Bob Marley.  But, Bob didnât send me a birthday letter when he was president.  Ronnie did.  It was 1988, I was eleven and this was the last year for Reagan in the White House.  I thought my sharing his birthday was the coolest thing.  I had no idea what his politics where nor did I care.  I considered myself a Republican then because my parents were Republicans and so this extra kinship with Ronnie felt strong.    My mom had the brilliant idea of sending him a birthday card and announcing the importance of the shared date.  I was a little apprehensive, how exactly do you tell a stranger, much less a president, that you have the same birthday?  Why would he even care?  Well, we bought a card and wrote a note.  Iâm sure my mom helped craft the sentence or else it would have been something like âI was born on Feb. 6 too.  Happy Birthday Mr. President.â   And, well, thatâs probably what it did say.  So, off went the card and about 3 weeks later arrived a letter from the White House.  It was the most exciting day of my eleven year-old life.  My family was thrilled too.  I learned of his death on Saturday night after a full day spent with old college friends.  A friend was looking at the now framed letter on my living room wall and said that Reagan had died today.  âWhat?â I thought.  Then I thought about peace and that it seemed so expected and so natural.  Iâve dealt with Alzheimer's in my family and it is trying disease, on everyone.  I told my friends that it was probably for the best for him and his family.  Then I went to the letter.  He, or a staff writer, wrote a short and sweet letter.  It is typed on a typewriter.  The date is off-center from the letterhead and the eagle emblem.  It begins by acknowledging our âmutual birthday.â  Then, in presidential fashion, goes into the history of Febuuary birthdays including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.  He tells me to study these great men and hopes they will inspire me the way they have inspired him.  The letter ends with Mrs. Raegan joining him in his wishes and may God bless me. His name is signed simply âRonald Reagan,â no mention of president anywhere.    We think he really signed it.  It doesnât seem to be a stamp.  I will probably never truly know. But, it doesnât matter.  My eleven year-old heart knows he touched this letter somehow.  In the bottom left hand corner is my full name and childhood address.  My name has a typo.  Since the beginning of the letter I have gone from Anna to Anny.  At eleven, this typo crushed me.  Now, it is endearing.  It makes the whole letter so much more real, so much like the man whoâs birthday I share.     Dear President Reagan,  I am honored to have shared your birthday.  Every February 6 I will continue to remember your birthday and those of the other great presidents you mentioned.  Washington and Lincoln were truly amazing, but they donât mean as much to me.  I canât look over at my wall and see their handwriting.  I loved your letter and will always cherish it.   May you and your family find the peace you deserve and thank you, from my eleven year-old self and from me now, for all you did for our world.  Sincerely, Anny
J. is a âmilitary brat.â  Sheâs been all over the country and Germany, her family moving from place to place every few years.  Somehow she has roots in the mid-west and Virginia.  Iâm thankful for those Virginia roots, happy they brought her friendship to my door, literally.  Ohio claimed her during undergrad.  She was a Buckeye.  I guess she still is.  Iâd like to think she is more a Wahoo, but itâs not my choice who wins out.  The Buckeyes could probably kick our Wahooâs football ass any day.  J. now lives in Austin and owns a home there.  Her settlement came by way of Miami and Seattle, her traveling childhood brought to the surface in young professionalhood.  Sheâs an audiologist.  I think she is resilient.  She lived 3 doors down from me in one of Thomas Jeffersonâs original rooms at his University.  We had fireplaces, wood floors, a sink inside a closet, and a bathroom we had to walk outside to use.  Not exactly an outhouse, but close enough.  We were in grad. school, but J. was only there for one semester.  We spent hours chatting in our rooms, at night walking from room to room in our pajamas, outside.  When she left it was winter and cold, the freezing temps. had been lifted by fires in our fireplaces.  Our individual rooms heated the old fashion way.  J. was the best at making a fire that didnât smoke the room out.    I was sad to see her go and begged her to stay, to change her practicum placement to Virginia, not Kentucky.  But her plans were made far before any of us moved to the Range.  So she left but came back for Foxfields and a New Yearâs party in a cabin in the woods.  J. is a good friend.  She is smart, logical, sensible and yet just as neurotic as I am (well maybe not).  We talk about how much our lives have mirrored each otherâs while she moved from state to state or country to country and I lived in the same pink bedroom for 18 years.    Iâm so glad she stayed for that last semester.  Iâm so glad she couldnât find an apartment or dorm room for those few months.  Iâm so glad we are friends.  And I love her couch or air mattress in her tiny cross-country apartments.  Sheâs an anchor in my life, a friend who will always be there and never feel that far away no matter the actual distance.
Restaurants are closing or are closed by now.  Itâs late, but youâre hungry.  Youâre not sure you want to cook, but you really want a salad.  Drive to Ukropâs on your way home.  Rifle through your dashboard CDs looking for Emmylou Harris.  You need Emmylouâs mellow voice to match your mellow mood.  Sheâs not there, but youâre happy you find Johnathan Rice.  Put it in the CD slot.  The volume is louder than you expect but you donât change it realizing âQuiet Hushed Voicesâ is what you were really craving.  Sing along to it with the sunroof open.  Donât mind the people in the parking lot looking at you with bass flowing out the open windows.  Keep singing the words.  Park, knowing you are only pausing the moment.  Enter the automatic doors.  Pick up romaine lettuce and chevre.  A salmon fillet is a sudden passing desire; you grab it, and hummus, for snacking.  Check yourself out in the self-serve lane.  Get back in the car.  Turn the key and hit the sunroof button.  Keep the duet with Johnathan going.  Feel your brotherâs bass in the floorboards and through the speakers in the door.  This is good music.  Know that you canât go home.  You want to drive and listen and feel the wind.  There are no mountains here, no country roads just 5 minutes away.  There is the highway.  Head toward home, but pass it.  Make the right hand turn you make every morning on the way to work.  Bare left this time.  Take the toll road, the Downtown Expressway.  You need a hit from the city buildings; the skyline up close and 50Â¢ is worth it.  Pass Rosewood and the U of R Stadium.  Put Johnathan on repeat.  Slow at the toll booth until the SmartTag signals a green light to keep going.  Speed up, a horse out of the gate.  Get the center lane.  Pass VCU and the Cherry St. overpass.  Pass the 2nd St. exit and Thomas Jeffersonâs Capitol building.  Go under a quarter mile of overpasses with lights burning a fluorescent tunnel.  Emerge to the buildings of downtown Richmond.  Wonder why so many lights are on.  Follow the signs to 95 North and 64 West, Washington and Charlottesville.  Curve around on the highway bridge through low buildings.  Look out the window, to the left, at the taller lit buildings.  {I want to love this city.}  Be amazed that you are driving so close to the bricks and concrete.  See the clock tower of the renovated Main St. train station on the right side, you can almost touch it.  Sing with Johnathan.  Get off at the Broad St. exit.  Go quickly through Shockoe Bottom.  Remember the recent attacks here.  Get back to 95 going South this time to Petersburg.  Stay in the right hand lane, curve right at exit 73C toward the Powhite.  Imagine you are not driving but are suspended, floating through these buildings, under the highway above you.  Look through the windows of La Difference.  Wish you understood the difference.  Go back through the tunnel of lights.  Pass the Jefferson Hotel and the Governorâs Mansion.  {I want to love this cityâs history.}  Pass the exit for the Boulevard.  Quell the wish to live there in an apartment alongside Virginiaâs museums and with a balcony.  Go on to Cary St.  Go to your home.  Park and walk to your building.  With the full moon behind say quietly and to no one 'I want to love this city.'  Unlock you door.  Put down your bags.  Wash you hands.  Decide itâs too late for salmon.  Get a large bowl out.  Pour the salad into it.  Begin to toast pecans from the freezer.  Crumble the chevre over the lettuce.  Pour on your homemade balsamic dressing.  Add the toasted pecans.  Take a bite as you walk to the living room, to your computer.  Realize you are a good cook, that this salad should be on menus.  Sit down at your laptop.  Put Johnathan on again.  Listen to him, and write this.
Rrrrrrrring Me:  Hello. Them: (silence) Me:  Hello Them:  Yes, is this Mrs. So and So Me:  Yes* Them:  Hi Mrs. So and So.  Iâm calling for the Richmond Fraternal Order of Police Me:  Hello.  Iâm sorry,  did you think I was home?  Iâm actually not able to answer your call right now.  Gotcha!  Ha Ha!  Please leave a message, unless this is a computer operated telemarketer in which case do not ever call me again or I will BITE YOU.  If this is the Richmond Fraternal Order of Police then also do not call me again unless you have actually done something about the 10 murders that happen each month in our fair city, especially those that happen around the schools I teach in.  When I feel good and safe about driving to the schools I teach in, those schools which sadly produce men that will kill others on the same streets, Iâll answer youâre call.  And listen, weâre working on educating kids that donât kill.  Weâre trying.  Iâm not so sure about your fraternal orderness.  So, until that time, Stop. Calling. Me.**  *Iâm thinking, âIâm not a Mrs. which means you are a telemarketer asshole cause no one else calls me Mrs.â **What I really said was, âIâve asked you five times to stop calling me, especially early in the morning and especially on Sundays.â  This was followed by an abrupt click.    Sometimes, I wish I was a quicker with the unsolicited phone call comebacks.
It's all about the gmail.  New email to the right.  Read it, copy it, paste it, write it, send it.  In short, email it to me, the gapgirl is ready for mail.
Iâm sitting at the Getty along a path to the side of one of the buildings.  Iâm in the shade and leaning against the structureâs massive stonewall.  Iâm on a pathway to a terrace though itâs a path that is almost hidden.  People have to navigate around me as they walk through.  I wish theyâd go away and leave this public space private, for me only.  I can see a vast view of LA from where I sit from the hills to the oceans.  Ahead and slightly to the right is a small clump of tall buildings that make up downtown.  Beverly Hills is just below me.  There is a fire billowing on a mountain a few miles away.  Itâs in Santa Clarita a passerby says.  The smoke wonât reach LA because the winds blow toward the east, toward the mountains.  It looks both ominous and soft, like a cloud.  To the left and over the hills from the Getty is the Valley and Pasadena, though I canât see them I know they are there with clichÃ©d houses and perfect lawns.  There is smog that hangs in the air between the landscape and the sky, a visible reminder of this cities population.  To my right, if I careen around I can see the sea and Catalina Island poking its head just above the haze.  The 405 are below me and the traffic crawls from north and south.  Planes line up in the sky ahead, waiting to land at LAX.  This city is huge, a massive gallimaufry of rich and poor, everyday and famous.  The rich build houses on the mountains or even cliffs, ignoring the impending possibility of earthquakes.  They look like cracker or thin wafers that could tumble down like rocks sliding.  California has itâs own style to everything, but the houses in LA interest me the most.  Their style is a mix of Mediterranean, Spanish, and American classic.  The rich, modern houses are minimalist with hard lines and lots of glass, but mostly there is stucco, tan and smooth.  It is the red brick of southern California.    The Getty is an amazing place.  , a free art museum, open to the public.  But, people donât usually come for the art; they come to see the Getty.  It is a vast structure of buildings placed on a hillside overlooking all this city has to offer.  It is made of an off-white stone creating straight lines and curved walls.  The landscaping is immense, green, and perfect.  Fountains pop up in many places, an offering of serenity.  The buildings are so large that looking back on them from on of the many terraces and seeing people walking around on the balconies and inside through the glass, they look like tiny bugs, like insignificant, unimportant things.  People stand against the railings where I sit.  They squint and point trying to comprehend what they see.  The wind is strong at times on this hill.  They sun beats down an arid hotness, but in the shade of the building, a chill awaits.
Happy Birthday A.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What to say about A.?  Only she will know what the title of this post means.  She is a dear college friend whom I lived with for 4 years, 4 crazy party filled and chilled out years.  When I first met her I didnât think I liked her because she is so honest that it can be abrupt at times.  Then, her roommate went home for an extended time due to illness and A. and I became good friends and I saw her kinder, gentler side.  I ended up staying in her roommates bed quite often because my roommate was a freak of nature and I just needed to get away even if it was across the hall.  Iâm so glad we became friends and that she is in my life.    A.  is the kind of friend who is there for you no matter what.  Sheâll be there to help you move in to your new apartment or celebrate you graduation a year after she celebrated her own.  She is honest and doesnât judge.  When confronted with people who are quite strange she says, âit takes all kinds to make the world go round.â  We use to rag her in college because the words âmy mommy saysâ preceded almost every piece of factual or advice laden talk.  Well, her mommy did a great job.  She is a great girl and a good friend.    She married a few years ago.  He is a boy who counteracts all that we college friends thought she was.  He is country and mild mannered and loves hunting and listens to country music and watches racing.  A. was a bit wild in college so when we found out her choice we were a little confused.  It turns out that the domesticated life filled with good cooking and family all around is really her true self.  Her in-laws love her as much as we do and she has found a niche for herself and her husband.  They are beginning to build a house on 20 acres of land in the country soon.  I tell her that as soon as she puts a pool in Iâll be there.  I bow to A. and P. land on this auspicious day and bid you a good one.  May tiny pictures from walmart decorate the halls.   Happy Birthday,    ~ Azafata.
Why people?  Again, google has sent someone to my site who typed in 'together to pee.'  I just... I just... don't understand.
Ahh, little Elizabeth Bishop was so right.  So, I've lost my keys.  They are in North Carolina.  I am not.  I didn't realize I didn't have them until I awoke from the early morning drive back to my parents' house.  Many phone calls later, they are hopefully being fedexed to me and will arrive Tuesday sometime.  I'm trapped at my parents' house which isn't bad except when you want to be in your home, you want to be in your home.  And I, want to be in my home.  Say some prayers people, may fedex not lose THAT package.  I've never lost my keys before and really it's not a huge deal though it may look like (WRITE it) like disaster.
The LA chronicles are not over, but I have been busy washing clothes, making gifts, and repacking for another weekend of wedding festivities.  So, Iâll be away from bloggerland for another few days.  In the meantime go to my little blogchildâs site.  Yes, yes, Anna has a child, in bloggerland that is.  Go, read, comment.  urlLink  WahooBuckeye   needs you.
with another city.  I never thought I would like Los Angeles.  Never.  I thought I was an East Coast girl through and through.  Turns out, I could go either way.  Los Angeles isnât anything I thought it would be.  It wasnât as flashy as I had imagined.  It didnât seemed as pretentious as it looks on TV and there was no preparing me for the weather.  LA was amazing and good to me.    I tend to fall in love with most cities that I visit.  Maybe itâs because travel is a carefree existence or maybe itâs because each city beckons to a different part of me.  Why did I fall in love with LA?  Well, it isnât the rat race it seems to be or maybe I never came in contact with part of it.  And the sun shines everyday.  There are never clouds in the sky or rainy, mucky days (there are also not stars).  I knew this about LA, but I didnât believe it.  My clouded East Coast brain couldnât fathom endless days of pure sunshine.  How could you be sad in a place like this because whatever happens, at least itâs a beautiful day.    My love for LA is fleeting, though.  I know when I am home Iâll settle back into the humidity and heat and then the cool air of fall and the snow of winter.  I would miss the seasons if I lived here.  Endless days of sitting by the pool would begin to disorient me.  Life here would be like an endless vacation.  It would be like play, like pretend, just beyond the touch of reality.  And my love for LA is not true because it is shared with my love for London, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Morehead City.  LA is just another city to add to the list of places I could live if I ever decided to pack up and leave the state and family I know so well.  I never do make plans to move to the cities I love so much because I think if I lived there the magic would begin to disappear after a time and I donât want that to happen.  Iâd rather hold these cities in my heart as perfect gems nestled on hillsides or islands or by the sea, covered in fog or basking in sunlight.
Lots of things to say, but I'm tired and trying to get back to east coast time.  I love and miss LA.  It changed me.  I'll tell ya all about it later.  Time to watch movies and relax.
Iâm off to LA for fun in the sun with my best friend.  Itâs the last of a girlâs romp before she (you guessed it) gets married.  I plan to do some touristy things and then just hang with my best gal pal.  I miss her and Iâll miss her even more when she gets hitched because girlfriends change ever so slightly when marriage happens.  I was hoping weâd hop over to Vegas for the weekend, but weâve opted for time in LA with her fiancÃ©.  Well, I love them both, loads and loads.  Iâm excited to see them, either in a flashy city or just in their living room.  Have to say though, kinda wish I was going to see a booby show.  Iâll blog at ya next week.  Blogger back yaâll.
We at mind the gap are a happy and loving lot.  We like diversity and we like to celebrate with our friends when they have things to celebrate.  Today is such a day!  Today is Bastille Day in France, a day of celebrating the end of monarchal rule.  And so, in honor of our French friends, a list of things we love from France, or things that France pimped out to us.  â¢ the Statue of Liberty  â¢ le baguette (yummy) â¢ the colors of the French flag  â¢ fashion  â¢ le croissant (even yummier)  â¢ Dijon mustard â¢ Champagne  â¢ Cannes Film Festival â¢ toy dogs (because the French took them everywhere long before Paris Hilton was born) â¢ Jaques Costeau â¢ Les Mis (though in French it would be lost on me) â¢ Jean-Marc Gaspard Itard and the wild boy of Aveyron â¢ Matisse, Degas, La Tour, Cezanne, Monet, Rodin, Renior, to name a few â¢ Joan of Arc â¢ âLet them eat cake.â  This list does not endorse the loving of all things French because those French bastards didnât go to Iraq with us so we said the hell with you too.  Our amazing and welcoming country forgot that French troops helped us in the American Revolution and about the gift that France once bestowed on us, the Statue of Liberty, and said, 'Weâll call French fries, Freedom fries instead,' ignoring the fact that French fries are actually from Belgium.  âHa, take that you French bastards,â our government said.  Well, those French bastards were pretty spot on and had a sense that Bush was blowinâ smoke about weapons of mass of nothinâ.  Damn those French bastards!  Happy Bastille Day everyone!
The Shakers say it is a gift to be simple and a gift to be free.  âSimple Giftsâ is an old shaker song written in 1848 and it is one of my favorites.  It is a song about simplicity, but it also says that âwhen we find ourselves in the place just right, we will be in the house of love and delight.â  While the house of love and delight sounds like a cheesy, incense burning, hippy joint, the sentiment is what gets me.  I like the idea that when we are true to ourselves we will find the simplicity of life which ultimately brings peace.    But itâs not always so such a simple gift.  We are all given gifts to some degree.  We are can run companies, we can cook amazing food, we can play an instrument, we can balance budgets, we grow a garden, we can teach someone to read, we can diagnosis symptoms, we can write, we can act, or we can see the world differently through the lens of a camera.  We all have talents and gifts which should be a part of our everyday lives.  The act of doing what you are good at, what you are talented in, is itself simplicity and freedom.    My cousin B. is an amazing photographer.  She has an eye like no one Iâve seen.  She loves taking pictures of things like rust and wood.  She can take scenery and portraits, but these are not her specialty.  Those shots are easy and generic, anyone can do them.  The passion she sees through her lens are things we would easily pass over.  B. hones in on the things that we feel corrode of corrupt surfaces.  Somehow, B. finds the beauty in them and she shows rust and corrosion as art.  And she does it so well.     She has never sold a photograph and has pretty much stopped taking pictures creatively when she left college.  All because the cost of taking and developing pictures is too much for her budget.  Iâm saddened by this and I tell her often that she has to start taking pictures again, that she has to use her gift.  It is a gift to be simple and a gift to be free and sometimes we have to fight to use those gifts.  If our favorite writers and actors and doctors and teachers didnât use their gifts, where would we be?  How many times has your life been changed by someone elseâs gift?  I know that B. is scared and I understand it.  Putting your creative self out for the world to reject is a terrifying thing.  But that simple Shaker song says that  âWhen true simplicity is gain'd, To bow and to bend we shan't be asham'd, To turn, turn will be our delight, Till by turning, turning we come round rightâ  So bow and bend B., simply use your gift, youâll turn round right.
Numero dos is done.  Two weddings down, three to go.   The other day I received yet another wedding invitation.  As I perused the oh so familiar oversized envelope I wondered, âWho the hell is getting married now?â  I thought I was aware of all the weddings for this season.  Apparently now, but I was relieved to find out it is a second cousin.  Iâm not close to her, so the pain of another wedding was lessened at bit.  It would actually be fine if I didnât make it to this one.  But, it is in Florida in September.  Either that would be a great time to get a last minute tan or to see the wrath of a fabulous hurricane since it is the beginning of that season.  I donât know if Iâll go.  It would really be a weekend of hanging out with the rents which, letâs face it, I do enough of in my own apartment when they decide to come visit, often.  I am; however, quite happy for this cousin as it is her second time of engagement though the first for actual invitations.  Sheâs in her late thirties and that alone gives me a bit of hope and room to breathe.  Tonight was a great wedding.  The drinks flowed and good food was served and we ate dinner overlooking a lake at sunset.  There were people Iâve never seen before and familiar faces from all the showers and pre-parties.  There were good friends and new friends and family.  And there was dancing and pictures and smiling and happiness and love, lots of love all around.   Starting at 3pm in a Catholic Church, I nestled in to back row pew and beckoned friends to follow suit.  Our row, full of teachers, was the official peanut gallery.  We could hear and eye everything from out backseats, the late comers, the whispers, the crying children, the brat child telling her mother to âshush,â we saw it all and yet WE kept quiet.     Not being Catholic, we were worried that this would be what my Dad likes to call and âaerobics classâ service.  You know, up down, up down, kneel, up down, kneel, etc.  But, my good friend L. and C. decided on a Catholic light service since they too are Catholic light, if anything. The wedding was short and pretty with well-chosen songs and readings. The parish was beautiful.  I always love big, cathedral parishes; they almost make me want to be Catholic.      I go to so many weddings that I could probably recite the scriptures and the vows by heart, but this wedding did not bore me and when L. walked down the isle with tears in her eyes I kinda welled up myself.  Iâm not a crier at weddings.  In fact, I thought for a long time that I had a stone heart because of my lack of crying at weddings.  Everyone else gets caught of in the emotions and you see women dabbing their eyes and bridesmaids pulling Kleenex wrapped about their bouquets.  Iâve never needed a Kleenex at a wedding and have always though âYeah, itâs a wedding, whatâs the fuss, why are you crying?â  But, today, for L., I understood a little more.  Sheâs almost 31 and the tears in her eyes were the symbols of her waiting so long for that man who loves and respects her and that she in turn loves and respects.  Heâs not a perfect man, but he is one with whom she can share a life and so she cried for all that she is getting as she walked toward him.  And when I saw her crying, walking with her father, I thought of myself and if I ever find that man Iâm sure then that my stone heart will certainly melt and tears will run down my face as I walk toward him too.    Cheers to L. and C., may you live happily ever after!
So I havenât been great at blogging lately, especially since I returned from vacation.  I even wrote those beach ones on vacation when I was up late at night and bored.  But, now back at home there are things to distract me.  I should be writing all day since I have no job, but I picked up a few kids to consult on and tutor so that takes up a few hours a week and then well, today, Iâm just procrastinating.  I have my final paper due for a class that finished on Tuesday night.  The paper was actually due Tuesday, but she gave us an extension and I took it.  I am the worst procrastinator.  I will put things off until it is 2 hours to deadline, but this stress is really what gets my creativity and productivity going.  Iâve tried to be diligent and work on things early and it is so lackluster that it seems a waste of time.  Iâve tried to put my own deadlines on things to make me work on it and then go play, but no, again, I donât fall for my own tricks.  So, today, I probably should have turned it in sometime this morning, but she didnât give us a time and so I havenât started.  But, now, now Iâm getting ready to start.  It should only take two hours or so, unless I read some blogs, or turn on the TV, or have to call that friend back, or have to find that CD thatâs been missing for 3 months because only THAT CD will make me productive.  Anyway, off to work on it, *wink*.
I met him two weeks ago before I went to the beach.  Iâve been thinking about him ever since and am so happy when I see him.  He lights up my face and makes me feel like I have the best life in the world.  He is amazing.  Iâve even met his family and they are amazing.  He has a brother and sister and his dad his handsome and his mother is kind.  They are calm and centered and welcoming.  On Monday, his mother gave me five ears of corn, just because.    This boy is undescribable.  It doesnât matter what I write because you canât possibly get the full scope of him.  He has wisps of blond hair and blue eyes and when he says my name I melt.  His personality shines even when he is in a different room.  He is sweet and cuddly and playful and so much fun.  And the reason that he lights up my day and makes me want to appreciate everything that I have is because he canât walk because of a tumor on his spine and he has cancer and Downs Syndrome and heâs four years old.  He deserves to live until he is 80 years old with a life filled with happiness and productivity and good people all around him.  He deserves so much this little one, this boy that I met.
Morehead City, NC.  On the Bogue Sound.  When you hit Morehead City limits you know you are at the beach.  Windows are being rolled down and the warm, musty salt air begins to hit your face.  Your hair begins to curl almost instantly.  You know good grits are on their way too because beach water makes the best grits.  You cross the bridge over the Bogue Sound and see a glimpse of that magical water, part lake, part ocean, part river, all saltwater and controlled by the tides.  There are clams and oysters and sand dollars and porpoises in this water too and you wish you were staying on the sound.  At the light after the bridge you take a right toward pine knoll shores, just a few miles away from Atlantic Beach, from you childhood.    The house sits in front of the ocean, facing what seems to be an endless amount of water.  You canât believe there is actually something beyond the point that your eye canât see.  The horizon is so far away that you see whole clouds from top to bottom in the distance.  Some nights, there are storms at sea, you see the lightning, but the rain and thunder never make it to shore.  You wonder what good a storm at sea does, were any boats caught in it?    Some days the wind is so strong on the beach that you have to stay in or go to the inlet or to Fort Macon or a day trip to Beaufort.  Some days there is no wind and the heat comes off the sand like it is willing you to leave.  Some days the rain comes in at lunchtime and moves you from your saltwater post.  Everyday, you want more, more sand clinging to your toes, more saltwater up your nose.  The ocean pummels and turns you out.  You keep going back to it.  In low tide there are tidal pools a short distance from the dune.  These are your favorite. There is enough seawater to float you on a raft and as the tide is leaving there are enough waves to keep you moving.  The tidal pool is the best of all worlds, no thought of a rip current and all the luxury of   On calm nights the moon glows in the sky so bright that the reflection off the water mimics daytime.  You swear you could see by it.  You know that nighttime is the best time on the beach.  The beach is yours then because no else ventures to the beach at night.  You sit on the deck and look at the horizon or the shape of the moon.  You feel like you have a secret that no one else really wants to know about.  How could anyone not love the beach more at night?  You donât understand the fascination with the daytime, the sun and the rain, when the nighttime brings the moon and crabs and loggerhead turtles.  You know the secret and though you try to share it, others prefer sleep.     Soon you must leave the crystal coast of North Carolina.  No other beaches in the world will compare.  There is simplicity and elegance in North Carolinaâs crystal coast.  There are very few trappings of fancy dwellings or pools seamlessly flowing into the ocean.  There are just beach houses, many are old, and some are new or just well kept.  But the house isnât important, itâs the beach the matters.  Itâs the weather and the sand and the promise of good shell hunts.  Itâs suntans and bathing suits and rinsing off before you come inside.  Itâs a morning swim then lunch then back again then dinner out.  Itâs beach towels draped over the deck at the end of the day.  Itâs the dayâs catch on the pier or at the surf.  Itâs floppy hats and sun visors and sunscreen and big umbrellas.  Itâs rafts and buckets and shovels and sandcastles.  Itâs enduring the grit of the sand and the stickiness of the water.  Itâs the oldies station on the radio and itâs your family all around.  Itâs the beach in North Carolina and part of you doesnât ever want to leave.
A rental for a week for your family, but a house to someone else.  The evidence of the family who owns the house is all around.  The selection of beach reads on the bookcase in the hall, a small sampling of games with missing pieces in the living room, pictures of the grandpa who worked his whole life to buy the house, artwork from local artists, and the choice of curtains that donât match the furniture.  You enter a rental house like you enter a hotel.  You know it is not yours yet you will treat it is such for the next week all the while ever thinking about the family who calls it âour beach house.â    There have been houses that donât lock things away.  The fishing pole of the grandpa who bought the house when he retired hangs on the wall beckoning you to use it.  So, youâre father does and on the first cast into the ocean he breaks it.  Itâs too bad the original grandfather is dead or your father would have apologized to him.  Your whole family is a bit embarrassed, but your motherâs friend who rented the house said we were free to use the poles so your guilt is lessened a bit.  Still, too bad about ole granddad.  There are the houses that seem to want to share the experience with you.  They leave out a guest book and brochures about the area.  You glance at them.  There have been visitors from as far away as Ohio or as close by as New Bern.  Your brother calls the travelers from New Jersey and New York Yankees.  You call them Yankees too, but not out loud.  They tell stories of their weeks, how much their family loved the house, the good weather they were fortunate to have, and they note their favorite restaurants.  You wonder why they choose to write what they write.  The guest book is quaint, but you are happiest about the tide chart on the bulletin board, now you can start your vacation.    Exploring the house, you canât believe that people share their space so openly with others that they will never meet.  The coffeepot and spoons and beds and pillows and sinks and bathtubs and deck chairs and lamps are all communal property.  There are fragile things about and when your niece knocks over a lamp and it shatters feel sorry for the family again, but then you think that the ownerâs expect these things; beach houses are for children too.  You wonder how all the house was stocked.  Did the ownerâs really like the dark, dense fabric on the overstuffed couches or was the whole ensemble on sale?  Did they pick up the appliances at a thrift store or are the leftovers from the family 1970s orange kitchen?  Your family discusses the flaws in the house, in the decorations.  They have ideas on how to make it better, what to paint or how to arrange the furniture.  You are quick to remind them that it is better than any of their beach houses.  Oh yeah, they donât have beach houses.  No one is amused.    Some houses have a washer and dryer and this is a luxury.  You do a million loads in one week, more than if you were at home and partly just because you can.  You go home with clean clothes; this you realize is quite nice.  Other houses have a linen service and beds are made for you and towels are provided.  You feel a bit pampered by this, but youâd rather have the washer and dryer back.      There are houses with air conditioning so strong you end up with a stuffy nose going from hot to cold to hot to cold.  There are houses where your family breaks the AC and has to have the unit replaced midweek.  You are again a bit embarrassed, but realize you are just helping with the maintenance of the place.  Then there are houses with no air conditioning at all, just ceiling fans and the hope of good ocean breezes.  These are your favorites.  These remind you of camping in childhood.  This is what the beach feels like to you, heat cut by cool breezes off the water.  Days when there is no breeze you thank God for the invention of ceiling fans.  It takes a good day to get use to the heat and the breeze, but when you do, you donât ever want air conditioning at the beach again.  You sleep in little clothing and one sheet, you like the simplicity of this type of house.    In your mind you are always building the perfect beach house.  It is oceanfront with enough bedrooms to house you immediate and extended family.  It is not new, it is old and well worn, and there is a lot of wood.  The oceanfront deck is partly covered and partly open to the elements.  There are rocking chairs and a hammock.  There is a table for eating and playing cards.  A walk stretches to the dune where just before the stairs begin there is another small deck with seats built in and a shower hose for rinsing off.  The house has most of its bedrooms on the first floor.  Upstairs, at ocean view and deck level, there is a family room and kitchen and dining room in one space.  There are many large windows.  The dining room table is big enough to sit 12 and there are folding tables for extra company.  You want your whole family here and you create a space that allows for it.  Couches in the living room turn into beds.  There is a good stereo with speakers throughout the house and the deck.  Oldies beach music is always on.  Every bedroom has a well-made ceiling fan and can be closed off to the rest of the house so that windows can be opened at night.  There are beach chairs on the deck and in the garage, waiting for the sand.  They are wooden with cloth backs.  There are rafts and lifejackets and paddleball sets and kites and bachi ball.  The house is always full of people.
They wake up early in the morning to play together.  They are little girls with smocked dresses and bows in their hair.  They run around with high-pitched voices learning to share the toys they have brought, to the beach, to a family vacation.    Little girl cousins are a special thing.  They are automatic playmates and best friends.  They share genes and are beginning to share their lives, their growing up.  They clamor to the beach with all their might, they play in the sand for hours, filling buckets, dragging water from the surf, and hunting for shells.  They are adorable in their bathing suits and their skin tans easily even through super strength sun block.  Their fathers or mothers take them into the water and hold them safely from the waves.  The tidal pools are a perfect depth.  Rafts are their best toys, but sometimes it is just their hands and the sand and saltwater.  They get dirtier than they have ever been and never seem to notice the grittiness, the stickiness.  They donât want to go into the house even after hours of playing, but they love to rinse off with the hose, a semi grown up shower for a little girl.    Watching your nieces you relive your cousin time at the beach, at Salter Path Family campground, on the Bogue Sound.  Your playground was the sound and your favorite things were floating on a raft on the calm water and clam digging.  You and your cousins where obsessed with shells.  You hunted them tirelessly throughout the days on the beach or at the inlet at the north end of the island.  At the end of the shell hunts, you surveyed your treasurer.  You memorized the shapes and names, the olives and whale eyes and baby cradles and cigarettes.  It is years later that you realize, browsing through shell books that some names were made up by your mothers, sisters.  The next morning, you woke up early to set up shop.  You took boxes your mothers had packed in, turned them upside down, and laid old towels on top.  You set out your shells by the side of the road in the campground.  You sold seashells by the sound.  You were thrilled with every purchase.  After a few days of selling, you and your cousins and mothers would walk the path of the campground to the real shell shop near the main road.  You were amazed with the polished shells.  You bought cleaned sand dollars and gold-rimmed hermit crab shells and rope bracelets.    Your cousin still loves shells and houses them in glass jars in her home.  You donât need them around you anymore, but when you see shells or revisit the beach or see little girl cousins playing, you wish for the days at Salter Path, for the shelling and sound.  You wish for you cousins and you hope the new cousins will long for their beach days and each other when they are older.

Letâs just see how much actually gets done.  And no, I have nothing else in my head to write about.  Sorry.
â urlLink Stuart Weitzman  .  OhMyGod we have to go in.  Theyâre having a sale.â  I say to K.    Poor K has no idea what or who Stuart Weitzman is. âSure,â she says and we enter.  The store on Rodeo is small yet two salespeople greet us at the door.  They actually talk to us and welcome us and tell us about the sale.  We have just come out of Ralph Lauren across the street where I found, but did not buy, a pair of purple leather mules on sale for half price at $495.  I knew Stuart could be much more affordable in department stores, but I expect the Rodeo store to have sales where shoes were still $200- $300.  I am wrong.  Every shoe on the sales rack is $75.  âHot damn,â I think âI just might buy something on Rodeo Drive, baby.â    K and I try on several pairs.  I find some fabulous black satin high heels with an impossibly cute bow covering the toe.  K finds some strappy white heels that she considers for her wedding day.  We each buy nothing, coming back to the reality that even at $75 a pair; we donât live a Stuart Weitzman life.  We leave, the salespeople shockingly bidding us a good day.  We are tired by this 2nd hour on Rodeo.  We have seen JosÃ© Eber outside his salon, a woman clutching her toy dog in  urlLink Chanel , huge canary diamonds at  urlLink Van Cleef & Arpels , a rail thin blond model standing as a bored yet beautiful greeter at  urlLink Dior , and the back, private entrances to  urlLink Armani  and  urlLink Gucci .  We are heading toward the car, parked in the sun in a free space in front of someoneâs small bungalow and perfectly manicured green lawn.  I am thirsty, having downed my bottle of water noisily in Gucci while walking among the fur trimmed dog beds covered in Gs.    We think we were done with the pseudo shopping and the mouth gaping staring and then all of sudden we walk across Plexiglas ovals in the sidewalk.  Below the âwindowsâ were human size ant holes with manikins ironing or just posing.  There are three of them, two girls, one boy.  âWhat the hell,â I think.  K and I look above us and there is no sign, just a massive metallic rectangle as big as a Mack truck above us.  People are milling about in the opening to this, store?  The entrance is set back and it is all open, there are no doors, but there are two huge human sculptures with no heads resting just under the ceiling.  They seem to be holding up the second floor yet they donât quite touch it.  K and I walk in, we donât know what else to do, we are transfixed.     Inside there are concrete walls and before us a massive staircase that spans across the room leaving narrow âhallsâ along either side.  We walked down the left side and set into the wall there seems to be a concierge of sorts, a young brunette manning a phone.  âIs this a hotel?â I think.  Just past the conciergeâs window there are low tables and set into the concrete walls are lit shelves at hip level.  Things are strewn about.  Bags, shoes, just stuff covering everything, but with no sense of order.  I look closely at one of the bags and see the distinguishable triangle with the word PRADA.  I turn, âK, weâre in  urlLink Prada ,â I gasp, my face looking quizzical and amazed at the same time.  K doesnât say anything.  We keep walking.  We come around to the back of the room and there is another set of stairs mirroring the ones in the front yet opposite so that the staircases make a large triangle in the room.  We decide to go up, but have to navigate around shoes and the legs of manikins with no torso.  âWhat the hell,â keeps running through my brain.     At the top of the stairs we turn left and enter a room that runs like small hallways just above the space below so that on the right and left are narrow halls and in the front and back are slightly wider rooms over the stairs.  The walls are green and look like swiss cheese.  But, there are no smooth surfaces on the walls.  There are only holes.  I donât understand it and I follow Kâs hand to the wall.  Itâs plastic, green plastic swiss cheese, âWhat the hell?â    The rooms are created with the swiss cheese walls on one side and glass on the other to keep you from falling down the stairs.  There are metal racks of clothes along the swiss cheese walls with exactly 5 items on each.  Thin, tan, bleach highlighted men in black walk around carrying an item or two.  They are barely noticeable in this room, the fade, into theâ¦air.  When we turn the corner and hit the larger front room I spy the dressing rooms on the right side, above the stairs, I see two little girls playing inside, through the glass.  I think, âI know Prada is weird, but who tries on clothes behind glass, in front of strangers?â  Then, one of the girls hits something on the wall and the glass goes frosted.  âWhat.  The.  Hell?â    After I touch some $1500 mini skirts, we leave.  K and I donât understand what we have just seen.  Was it real?  It will be the topic of many conversations with Kâs fiancÃ© that week and it will be the first story I tell friends when they ask about L.A.  Iâll say, âIâm going to tell you about Prada, but you wonât understand.â  And when Iâm done telling them about the swiss cheese walls and the frosted glass theyâll say things like âWeird,â or âAre you kidding?â  And Iâll tell them that âyes, it sounds weird, but you still donât understand.  You really have to go.  You have to experience it.  Go to Prada on Rodeo.  Itâs worth the plane ride.â
I used to collect quotations.  Iâd culled them from quotation books or magazines or friends or even the daily email from Oprahâs website.  Iâd write them in a flowery printed journal in my best handwriting.  I wanted to the believe the lines like âKeep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow,â  but, Helen Keller never saw a shadow though she lived within one.  I wanted her words to show my how to not only look at the sunshine, but surpass it and become it.  She did, why couldnât I?    For years my favorite quote was âWe are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.â  When I found it I thought Oscar Wilde was my soul mate, that he understood my plight.  I even wrote it in fancy scrawl across a painted wooden board that held a curtain rod and hung it over 2 different bedroom windows.  But, looking at the stars does nothing for trying to reach them and if you donât come out in the daylight, the gutter must be a hot and miserable place.  âYou must do the thing you think you cannot do,â wrote Eleanor Roosevelt and she was right.  You must in fact do the thing you think you cannot do.  She was strong and brave and I trusted her words.  She was the original Nike slogan, âJust do it.â  These words pulled me through many papers and exams in college, but nothing, nothing in college or life could prepare me for what lay ahead.  My first years teaching I was energetic and naÃ¯ve and ready to take on the world.  I loved what I did and felt absolutely called to do it.  I thought that my teaching kids with autism was who I was.  I thought it defined me and that everyone should revere me for the work I did.  Those first years threw me into a tailspin of hatred and anger and bitterness and disappointment and fear and illness.  I complained constantly and to anyone who would listen, but friendships and life were slipping away.  Quotations and words of wisdom wouldnât pull me through and there were many nights I just cried and prayed.    I finally sought help and through a counselor learned that my life was full of unhealthy patterns and that I was the only one in control of what could happen in my life.  I didnât believe her and for 3 years cried and complained about all the things that happened TO me.  Then I began to use her advice and let the control go.  I had to learn to let go and forgive.  I had to learn to let life take me where it would.  I had to learn to do the thing I thought I could not do.  I faced the shadows and the gutters and Iâm still learning to leave them where they are, in the past.  You canât see the sunshine or stars clearly until you face their opposites.  And no one and no quotation will help you truly get there.  They can point the way, but you, you have to do the digging and nail biting eye to eye combat with all the bad things before you finally appreciate all the good ones and let happiness if not land, at least aim, at your doorstep, everyday.
Well, this is a stretch for me- Mrs Tech-Challenged 2004! I must be out of my mind to start this, but then again I have been called crazy more than once in this life! I don't know how much I'll have to share so bear with me! I know that I will try not to be unfair to any person in my scope of friends- and will not spread gossip or slander anyone ! I only hope I will have something meaningful to say on occasion. WISH ME LUCK!!!!! KC in Fla
Once again- for your giggle gene- My Friday Funny. Have a laugh my friends, it's better that a pill ( & this I know a little about lol) &nbsp;&nbsp; As &nbsp;I &nbsp;Mature........ As I mature I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just assholes.  &nbsp;I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.  &nbsp;I've learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better have a big willy or big boobs.  &nbsp;I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think.  &nbsp;I've learned that you can keep vomiting long after you think you're finished. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first, the passion fades, and there had better be a lot of money to take its place!  &nbsp;I've learned that 99% of the time when something isn't working in your house, one of your kids did it  &nbsp;I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away. &nbsp;&nbsp;Pass this along to 5 friends...trust me, they'll appreciate it. Who knows, maybe Something good will happen. If not...tough shit.  &nbsp;P.S.&nbsp; Thanks &nbsp;Janine! Have a great Day- Love KC
My day off, which means house work. God, I hate it!&nbsp; I usually work until 10:30 on Tuesdays, so the Hubby is home alone with the kids. Which is all right, he's great with them- but more often than not the house winds up getting trashed, while he is watching CNN in the bedroom! Then I have to clean up the 'aftermath' GRRRRR! &nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think that it's fair that the one day off during the week, that I would normally use as 'my time' I.E. web-surfing, gardening, reading , errands etc. should be taken up with cleaning the house for the second time in the week! ( Sunday is my cleaning day- top to bottom) I work all the rest of the time. I just did this shite 3 days ago! There are 5 people in this house damn-it! Why am I the only one that thinks toys all over the livingroom and 10 dirty glasses strewn around are upsetting??? Socks everywhere and HEY- a pair of size 4 toddler undies under the coffee table??!! Jeez- what happened last night? Or do I want to know????  &nbsp;&nbsp; What is that old comercial- 'Calgon- take me away!!!!............ lol !
All right, I know it's been a few days since I've been here- the truth is I didn't have anything of interest to say. That is, until I logged on last night and read the news..... &nbsp; A new man is now at the helm of Island records. At first I thought- so what? Just another corporate wonk to annoy all of us Lep fans. But after reading the article ( 3X, might I add) I've come to some conclusions. ( agree or disagree in my comments, I love a good debate!) &nbsp; 1- He seems to have come up the ranks from D.J.&nbsp; to Boss. This to me says he is a 'music lover', as opposed to a Businessman (accountant, paper-shuffler - you all get my drift, right?) &nbsp; 2- The fact that of&nbsp;ALL the 'established' artists that are managed by Island, He specifically mentions DL in the article makes me have hope!  &nbsp; 3- The release of LLWTG- FINALLY! Better late than never, perhaps. But if he liked the song alone- wouldn't he have released Lionel Richies version? After all, that would be promoting a record which has just been released- as opposed to one that has been concidered ' dead in the water' for a while now. &nbsp;&nbsp; Now I know that I may be 'blowing smoke' here, but I can't help feel that this is a good sign for the days to come. and the fact that our beloved guys are eligible for the 'R&R hall of fame' as of 2005 ( you all know how I feel about THAT- and if you don't , see my tag line on the forums!;-) ) Having someone like him at the helm of the ship may just mean smoother waters ahead for our band.&nbsp; JMHO- And you'll forgive me if I hope that I'm right on this one! Cheers all, KC :-)

I know, I haven't been here lately- but I had a good reason. Lightening hit the power pole in back of my house, which took out our power &amp; cable. I&nbsp;got the power back within a day, but the cable ( and my internet) took longer. There are times I wonder why these essential services are still above ground, and not in buried cables. After all, between hurricanes and Florida being the 'Lightening Capitol' of the U.S., it would make sense,Huh? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just when I thought things were getting back to normal, #2 child ( Andy) comes to me this morning with an earache. So off to the Dr. we go!! $20 at the dr. , and $50 dollars for the drops for his ear!!! I guess its P.B.&amp; J. sandwiches for me 'til payday!!  &nbsp; Hope you all are well, and I did manage a little time to get the links fixed ( sort of- lol) I'll get this web- crap eventually! Be well! KC
Just a quick post before work to wish a fellow ' 40 and Fab' club member a very happy birthday! Have a wonderful day Kim! Have one on me Sweetie!! ;-)
OK, after blowing off some steam, I though I'd try to get some links up. Well, they are not right again! though 3 of them are showing,I put in 6, and if you move the curser over one of them- 2 web addresses show up! GRRRRRRR! I really need to take a computer course or something. Any advice would be appreciated, since this is my 100th attempt, and I don't see anything wrong with what I put into the template. Ok, I'm gonna get off this thing for awhile- before this moniter winds up being a lawn ornament! Tata for now!
Or Pissed or whatever! I got home last night from work and immediately my Hubby got in my face- ' why didn't you make the car payment??!' I did! I mailed the frigging thing Friday,the 2nd. Well, they haven't got the darn thing yet!!!!  It was due last saturday ( at the latest) and I mailed it the day he got paid!    This bank I have my car loan through is supposedly a highly respectable institution, but the problem is they are based in North Carolina- NOT Florida! the closest branch of this bank to me is 2 hours drive. They have a web-site, but no payment options ( unless you have an account with them ) and you can not make a phone payment either ( unless your pymt. is 10 days LATE!!???). And this is the bank that the 3 biggest car dealerships in this area use for car loans!WHY!?? I can pay any of my other bills on line/over the phone with no problem. Even my local water company will take payments over the phone ( po-dunk town that I live in!) BUT NOT this upstanding institution!    So now, after talking with the rep from said bank, I will wait until this Friday, and if the check has not been recieved, they will call me and THEN take my payment over the phone. And I will have to pay the $30 fee to put a stop-payment on the check I sent, or end up paying twice ( which I can not afford!) Jeez- this Sucks! Off to throw a few pillows or something to vent! KC     P.S.- I am still tying to get you all linked up- I put the link section in, but the sites I have entered are not showing. Give me a little time to figure it out- I will get it done!
Today my eldest is turning 14. Though mothers are supposed to love all their children equally ( and I do!) this one holds a special place in my heart. I know, you all think- she's your first, that's why. But no, that's not it. You see, a mother gives her children life- but Becky has returned the favor.      ( flashback) 12/27/2002- 9:30 pm. I had just goten home from work. Tired, but no more so than any normal day. Becky was up and asked if she could have ice cream. I remember saying that if she could get it herself, she could have it. The next thing I saw was some strange lady washing my hair. I was in the hospital, apparently having just had brain surgery. An Aneurysm that would have ended my life except for 1 thing. BECKY. She was there, and I have since learned, called 911, her dad, and gave me her breath to keep me alive. I would not be here if not for her. I love my daughter.      Hug your child ( or anyone's child- they're all special) It might be the best thing you do! Happy Birthday Rebekah Leigh Fine! I love you! Mom :-0
One good thing about working  at the same job for a long time is that vacation time increases. I get a total of 4 weeks a year, and this is one of them! Tommorrow I'm off with my kids to Ocala, Fla- home of my good friend Janine. She's the one who put up living with me ( no easy task, I assure you!) in College. That she still thinks of me as a good friend after some of the lame-ass bull I did in school is truly a testament to what a great person she is! I hope that I have matured enough to make me more bareable now! Maybe I can get her to take a pic or two to put up later. And maybe I'll show her this blog- she'll be the first! And maybe she know's how to get the comment system working on this blasted thing. Michael tried, but the instructions are in tech=speak, and I am clueless as usual! Oh, and one more thing- Congrats to our favorite singer, on his upcomming nuptuals! He's picked a good day ( if the news is true ) I aught to know- It has been my wedding anniversary the last 20 years - Lep love, KC
Well, Independance Day is upon us, and I wish everyone a fun, safe holiday. I'll be working, so I will probably not be back here until Tuesday morning. BBQ something up for me, would you? And try to use those firecrackers wisely, not like some roadies we know lol! KC
A talking frog goes into a bank and approaches the teller. He sees right away from her window nameplate that her name is Patricia Whack. (He can read, too.)  'Miss Whack, I'd like to get a $30,000 loan to take a holiday.'  Patty looks at the frog in disbelief. In staying with the bnk policy pertaining to customer relations, she kindly asks him his name.  The frog says his name is Kermit Jagger, adds the fact that his dad is Mick Jagger, and that it's okay to give him a loan because he knows the bank manager personally.  Patty explains that he will need to secure the loan with some collateral. The frog says, 'Sure. No problem. I have this,' and produces a tiny porcelain elephant, about half an inch tall, bright pink and perfectly formed.  Very confused, Patty explains that she'll have to consult with the bank manager and disappears into a back office. She finds the manager and says, 'There's a frog at my window who says his name is Kermit Jagger, he claims to know you, says his dad is Mick Jagger, and wants to borrow $30,000, AND he wants to use this as collateral.' She holds up the tiny pink elephant.  'I mean, what in the world is this thing?'  (You're gonna love this).....................  (It's a real treat)......................  (Masterpiece)..............................  (Wait for it).................................  The bank manager looks back at her and says......  'It's a knickknack, Patty Whack. Give the frog a loan. His old man's a Rolling Stone.'  (You're singing it, aren't you?!!! - I knew you would.)     Just a funny to end a long day! Thank's to my cousin Patti for this one! Have a good one! KC in Fla

If I had a band I'd call it 'Boy Rogers,' in reference to the Bob's Big Boy/Roy Rogers rest stops in Jersey...  'cause they suck...  and so would my band.
Well...  I hate to say it, but life is getting back to normal.  This is not to say that I have forgotten, but life must go on.  We need to repair.  And I am doing this by trying to get some finances in order.  We all know, the best way to deal with things you can't controll is deal with those things that you can.  And we all know, I suck at finances.  But Microsoft Money is my new best friend.  I just stare at it.  There must be a law agains having hours of fun looking at different pictoral representation of the same information... my debt. but it makes me happy.  It's sad...  I'm such a loser right now.  The highlight of my day is entering my credit card purchases, and itemizing my paycheck.  Damn I need a boyfriend.  Well, maybe later, now it's money for me.  I mean... a boyfriend doesn't graph my expected net worth over the next decade... a boyfriend doesn't figure out how much of my Amex payment goes to principle...  a boyfriend doesn't keep you warm at night... wait... nevermind.  Maybe I just need to hook up with a cute accountant.  So also on this weeks agenda was the acquisition of a certain CD.  Ben Folds' new album came out last tuesday and I didn't feel it was responsible of me to go buy it when the country was in turmoil (actually I plum forgot, but now I didn't).  It rocks.  I love that boy and his wacky narrative lyrics.  One of the songs (seen below) makes me so excited for when I'll feel those things he talks about.  It kicks my ovaries into overdrive... wait... nevermind.  Damn! I need a man!  THE LUCKIEST  I don't get many things right the first time.  In fact I get told that a lot.  Now I know all the wrong turns and stumbles and falls brought me here.  And where was I before the day I first saw your lovely face?  Now I see it every day.  And I know that I am...  I am...  I am...  The Luckiest What if I'd been born 50 years before you in a house on a street where you live.  Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike; would I know?  And in a wide sea of eyes.  I see one pair that I recognize.  And I know that I am...  I am...  I am...  The Luckiest I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you.  Next door there's an old man who lived to his 90s then one day passed away in his sleep.  And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days and passed away.  I'm sorry I know that's a strange way of telling you that I know we belong.  That I know that I am...  I am...  I am...  The Luckiest
How do we move on now?  How do we live?  We must endure, and we know we willâ¦ but how?  I believe that the majority of us feel that some sort of war is eminent.  Maybe so, but where does that leave us civilians?  How do we support our country in our greatest capacity.  I work in a part (albeit small, but vital) of defense.  But being such a new member to this group, am I better suited for a military position?  I spoke with a friend of mine and she shuttered at the idea, although understanding my reasonsâ¦. I mean how could you not.  Our beautiful country is hurting, and she needs help.  I only hope that I will step up and help her in the most productive facility in my power.    So I have pondered whether the Army corp. of engineers is the place where I could do the most good in backing our great nation.  I am not the most physically adept person, but I consider myself fairly intelligent, and resilient.  Donât get me wrong, Iâm not running out tomorrow to enlist, but I am considering it, not as a career, but rather as an aide to America in its time of need.  How could I not?  When children are afraid of visiting grandparents, and grown men are afraid of whatâs around the corner, action needs to be taken, and, as weâve been told, it will be.    I only hope that theyâll take meâ¦  I wonât deny my sexuality, but I do wish to help my country.  Iâm sure many homosexual Americans agree with me in saying that we are hurting just as much as the rest of America (contrary to what Falwellâs recent interview on the 700 club may have referenced).  Obviously the future weeks will shed some light on this.      I attended a candle lighting vigil tonight at the Lincoln Memorial, and it was breathtaking.  To see all those people grieving was incredible.  To see thousands with candles is powerful enough, but to see them with our Nationâs capitol and most beloved memorials as their backdrop was immaculate.  It was inspiring to say the least, drawing upon those long since dormant feelings of patriotism that we put in drawers for days marked on the calendar marked with starsâ¦  Well every day is marked with a star; it just took a little pointing to notice themâ¦     Well, the stars are out tonight.
Humor is my primary tool for dealing with various circumstances, but it seems that humor fails me in response to today's events.  I, as all Americans, feel saddened and enraged, but simultaneously guilty for having these feelings since neither I nor any of my closest friends and family members did not perish in these incidents.  I have lived, or in the case of northern Virginia: still live, in all of the areas that were unfortunately ravaged, and continue to have ties with their residents.  Thankfully my loved ones are accounted for; I grieve for those who are not.  Perhaps the most frightening thing about the occurrence as a whole is the horrific beauty in its execution and efficacy.  The poetic nature of the elements of the attacks chills me.  Todayâs date, 911, already a pop culture siren of fright will ring more poignant in subsequent years.  While use of United and American vessels as tools of destruction will forever seem oxymoronic, for to me they will always mean peace and love.  Throughout the course of today I choked back tears mulling over how our dearest value, freedom, was literally and metaphorically removed when air travel ceased, and as Americans our wings were clipped.  It is times like now, and during tragedies such as this when I deplore my lack of faithâ¦  But then I realize that I have faith, not in a higher power, but in my country, and in the nature of its occupants, my fellow Americans.  Faith that I AM living free and just, no matter what transpires.  Faith that, as an entity, our reaction will be swift: and faith that it will be just.  I gain comfort in the fact that we shall endure, and await the time when humor returns as my staple coping mechanism, but until then I just donât feel like laughing. My love to all of youâ¦  If tears could only repair the damageâ¦
Warning: If you know me and are friends with Erica, this is nothing new. (This is something I wrote for my friend Erica's site.  But that was before I had one of my own...  Ehh, shuttup I'm starved for material.)  Do you ever come up with something out of the blue... find it funny... and then analyze the crap outta how your brain made that connection? Well, I do... All the time. Okay I'll lay it out for you.  I have a problem with money... well, it has a problem with me. I mean it hates me. Soon after I make friends with the dead presidents, they file for divorce and go live with another, semmingly more fiscally responsible chap. And the main source of our irreconcilable differences resides on the street. See, I have this car... a nice bloke (Sargent Hughes is his name)... but he's about 2 or 3 times what I can actually afford. I catch a lot of flak from people about this. Maybe I deserve it, but I just joke it off.   So when people ask me if Mommy and Daddy hooked me up with the aforementioned cherry ride, I respond with, 'No, it was an impulse buy... I went in for milk and came out with a TT and a Chunky.' They quickly get a perplexed look in their eyes and laugh nervously.  But, the point of all this is the strange neural connection. Impulse buy and Chunky. So I got to thinking. Why don't people ever run to the store to buy a Chunky. Every once in a while you'll get an 'I need a pack of Cinnaburst,' or the occasional, 'Can we stop for Kit-Kats,' even those 1-1/2 calorie Tic-Tacs get representaion. So, why is it that the Chunky falls into the role of the red-headed step-child of the confection world. I mean, if you smell it does it not engulf you in a chocolatey euphoria? What do Milky Way and Snickers have that poor Chunky does not? Perhaps it's the name? Would more people go out of their way for a 'Svelty' or a 'Scrawny' bar? Maybe it's fear of that age old proverb 'you are what you eat.' In this age of perpetual dieting maybe there's no room for such sweet morsals. God Damn you, Dr. Atkins!  So next time you're in the express checkout lane behind some jackass who put both shitake and portabello mushrooms in the same produce bag in order to bypass that ever-so-strict '10 items or less' rule, look over at the Chunky but don't buy it. Instead, go home and write it on next week's grocery list in big block letters... I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. That square 2-by-2 package is cooler than the other side of the pillow. Just some food for thought... Or is it a marketing scheme? *cashes check for next car payment* PS... Does anyone even know what Chunky tastes like? I never had one of those MF bars. At least I know what my next pity purchase is.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Put down that Krackle and pick up a Crunch bar you Commie swine!  My previous foray into the politics of candy bars has led me to another of the industry's most heated debates. Krackle: Hershey's answer to Nestle's ever-so-successful Crunch bar, or Red propaganda aimed at American youth culture?  I heard at a party once that Krackle was the most popular candy bar in the Soviet Union when it made its debut in 1978. (Actually, I think I heard it from me, I was in the Mr. Knowsomestuff stage of intoxication, but since then, too many coincidences have augmented my concern) I don't mean to get all Joe McCarthy on your ass, but all I'm saying is 'if it looks like a duck... and talks like a duck... it must be a commie.'  Here's a little history lesson on the subject of the beautiful merger of milk chocolate an puffed rice. Nestle (the premeire confectionist of perhaps the most historically neutral country on the planet, Switzerland) introduced it's Crunch bar in 1938. Since then this texturial fusion of silky brown and bumpy white (sounds like a personal problem to me -e) has taken the bar candy industry by storm.   September 14th, 1978... Hershey shocks the nation with their new treat. The timing here is key. The subversive Reds would have observed a new generation. A guardless generation to which the 'Red Scare' of the 50s was nothing but a beddy-time story, and indulgences such as Disco and the Hula-Hoop were waning in popularity, making way for new guilty pleasures. The success of this bar was nothing remarkable to say the least, due to the late entry into the market. Krackle could not overcome the brand loyalty that 'Crunch-ers' (as they prefer to be called) have developed over decades. But did they care? No.  Since its inception, Krackle has cornered two niche markets that target American youth. The first of these is Holloween miniatures. What better way to distribute propagnda. The genius of this plan not only is exhibited by its success, but also in the lack of the public's understanding of their role in the spread of communism in North America. It's as if the Archbishop of New York was distributing fliers for 1/2 price beer night at a Chelsea gay bar, while filled with a sense of warmth that he brought happiness to the public. The second market that Krackle leads the way in is the coveted puffed-rice-and-chocolate-grammar-school-sales-contest market. Need I say more? Now, let's talk packaging... Upon first look, the red wrapper with white type may not seem too objectionable, but it provides for the strongest of all arguments on the subject. It's a little known fact that the original design for the wrapper had the word 'Krackle' in yellow, but this was thought to be too obviously likened to the Soviet flag. The broken text of the word is in itself extremely anti-establishment. Coupling this fact with the blatent disregard for the arduous process of teaching youngsters to recognize the hard as well as the soft uses of the letter 'C,' rather acclimating them to the Cyrillic alphabet's lack of the aforementioned consonant's versatility, exhibits the coldness of their plan.  Even with all this convincing evidence, Hershey spokespersons continually refute these allegations and deny the existence of the scrapped 'Workers of the world. Eat Krackle' advertising campaign. So, do with this information what you wish, but keep your eyes and ears pealed, for Halloween is just around the corner.
...Our Program already in Progress:  Hello friends. I guess this first of all posts should begin with a little about myself. That's easy, the name's Travis. I'm 21, on the brink of 22-dom. I currently reside in the DC area. I've been here for about a month and I think I'll keep it. I'm an engineer and I'm gay. I stand by my opinion that gay engineers make cool engineers, whereas straight engineers make dorks...  That's not meant as a dig to any of you. Making fun of others just makes you feel better about yourself. No seriously... There are some kickass not-completely-devoid-of-social-skills engineers out there. Of the 14 on the east coast... I'm friends with 12.   A little background, you ask? Okay... Born and bred in suburban Connecticut. Had your normal childhood. Shitty at times, lovely the next day. I just had that one thing that made me a little different than all my friends. That one thing that I couldn't talk about for most of my life. But then don't we all. I don't mean to depict my sexual orientation as a sob story by any means. We all have our trials and tribulations and are stronger/wiser for having experienced them. And don't get me wrong I had a loving supportive family, conservative and religious at the crux, but subsequently (and possibly hypocritically) supportive during my coming out.  I had two older siblings, the kind you love to hate, and hate to love, again typical. They are two of the most amazing people I know. I looked up to them so much in my life my neck is still sore. At times I couldn't stand them, at times they'd make me cry, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  And now on to my final family member, my secondary caretaker... TV. I have this long standing opinion that nearly everything I know I've learned from TV. If you yield the power of that beautiful glowing box for good, the world is your oyster. Well maybe not that much, but as Martha would say 'It's a good thing.' Early in my childhood I discovered (no not men, that came a little later), movies. Thank god I was born when I was, 'cause the VCR shaped my life. Look upon this as you wish, but I believe it was genuinely good  Whenever you talk to a gay person, well at least most of the time. They always say, 'I always new I was different.' Which is our way of saying even before I got erections from MTV's 'The Grind,' (Go Eric) I knew somethin' was up. So in order to escape those alienation feelings I entered what I have since dubbed 'my celluloid closet.' Was it healthy, maybe not, but it got me through a lot of years when I wasn't ready to face myself. People often wonder why they didn't know. To a certain extent so do I, but I sure as hell didn't want them to figure it out. Is this why there are so many homosexuals in Hollywood? Is it because we all grow up as actors? Well I played the part well. I didn't go as far as to submerse myself in athletics, but I have gotten to the point where I can't tell if things I like are mine, or my cover's. I'm like Charlie Baltimore in 'The Long Kiss Goodnight,' or am I Samantha Caine? Take music for one: Do I really like Metallica, or was that just my psyche trying to compensate my seemingly feminine 'condition' with more masculine characteristics? Well I am 1 year+ out of that closet, and this sort of self discovery is going to continue for a little while.   Maybe that's why I'm starting this... but I highly doubt it 'cause I predict that the majority of the posts will be of a random nature as an outlet for the funny that courses through my veins.
So here's two for ya... and they continue to be bad.    Your blessing is no more than being safe and sound for the whole lifetime.    You are cautious in showing your true self to others.    So not only am I restricted from giving blood, but I am boring and fake as well.  What a catch... line up fellas, I start giving numbers at noon. I have to stop eating Chinese food.
If you could live anywhere in the world where would it be?  Me, I'd live in Mike Greybeal's pants... oh no, bad thoughts at work... BAD THOUGHTS AT WORK!
I had a lot of fun this weekend.  On saturday a coupla friends and I went to a DC101 (radio station in our nation's capitol) holloween party.  It was pretty cool, we didn't dress up or anything, but we all wore leather pants... I mean there's really no occasion otherwhen in the year to encase yourself in treated and dyed animal flesh, so you gotta take the opportunity when it arises.  Anywho, It was fun and I got trashed... naturally.  But I was Ferris Beulering everything.  I few hours into the party we were on the dance floor and some guy was carrying chicken to the VIP room.  I made and 'ooh, ooh' noise and pointed... so he stopped came back and let me swipe a piece.  I don't know who that kind soul was, but I was never the same after that moment...    ...And then I thought things couldn't get better, I had just scored some comp-fowl and there was a disco band that was really kickin'.  I was wrong.  I go up to the band to try to request some Jackson five (a Jender and T-$$ staple when dancing), but struck out 'No Motown he says... Try the DJ he says.'  Well it was a big neg from the DJ too (actually I think he said yes, but I didn't hear it, 'cause... well you'll see why).  So I'm  on my way back to my friends when I see Giligan trying to get into the VIP room, and the bouncer stopped him.  Meanwhile I look all official coming from the DJ booth and everything, so I call out 'No, that's Giligan let him in.'  In the wake of my thrall the bouncer bends to my desire... then I just walk in.  Now I've already had 5 beers at this point and there was free shit in VIP, bad combo for the T-ster.  So I try to contact Jender via cellular technology, but nothin', thankfully they came in a little later when the bouncer stepped away for a pee break.  Meanwhile I'm sitting around with all these radio people, and I see Giligan and he's like 'Dude, you got me in.'  and I'm like 'Go me!'      So I end up talking to Diane from the Elliot in the Morning Show for like and hour.  It must really suck to be them, 'cause they live hours of their lives in the public eye, and it must be taxing how everyone they talk to thinks they're like bestest frinds 'cause they ease the morning commute.  But back to me I down like 5 more beers, and Travis is kicked.  So I pile up a plate of wings and we head for the Metro.    Now this is where I forget everything.  I remember vaguely getting on the metro and making a fool of myself while I was on it.  I was told that I was telling everyone to get off ''cause Swank was too sexy.' Thank god for Nordstroms 'cause I strapped the handles of a shopping bag on my ears like a feed bag and yakked all the way from Vienna back to Jender's.    All in all I had a blast, until sunday morning.  but all y'all know what that's like. Late...
Well I eat too much Chinese food:  You make people realize that there exists other beautise in the world.    Which to me means 'You're gonna die alone you ugly bitch, and drive all hot men into the arms of other hot men.'  I think I should stop reading these things, 'cause Autumn pessimism is setting in.  'Cause I can make anything sound bad like if I get - 'You're going to come into a large sum of money,' I'll translate it to 'You're gonna die alone you ugly bitch, and the only thing that will have sex with you will be cold hard cash.'  Just kidding, I'm not really this bad... usually
Fortune Cookie: Our first love and last love is...  Self-love.    My sister tried to convince me that it meant; 'You love yourself, and in doing so better yourself in order to love others,' but I believe it meant 'Your gonna die alone you ugly bitch.'  You be the judge.
Hungover at coaster kingdom.    So I got trashed this past friday at my friend's.  It was monster night.  We watched old monster movies and carved pumpkins.  I forgot my pumpkin, but I'll get it tomorrow.  Anyway it doesn't matter it looked like Marv Albert.  Jender's was kick-ass though.  Solely because of the mouth.  which was my Idea. (just saving face 'cause even the cute dimple on mine couldn't salvage the gourd as a whole)    Anyway the next day She and I, and a new friend Swank went to Six Flags in MD.  It was a lot of fun, and a beautiful day.  But I wanted to hurl the whole time.  We were in line for the Batwing, right, and Swank was all 'I don't wanna go on.. hear the people screaming?'  So Jender was like 'They're just happy,' and I was all 'They're screaming for Charo.'  It was really funny, at least to me in my diminshed brain cells state.  So after dropping a Jackson at random games around the park I won back to back roll-a-balls and acquired a stuffed Aligator named Charo (coincidence... there are two things I don't believe in... Coincidence and Gay Republicans).  Come to find out Charo is actually a transvestite and his real name is Ken Adams, how's that for twilight zoniness?      Well Incubus' new cd comes out tomorrow, so pick it up.    have a TT-rific day...
I tend to order a lot of Chinese food, so I've decided to put up my favorite Fortune Cookie wisdoms whenever I encounter them.  My sister got this one last week, and I assure you this is verbatim, complete with exclaimation point:  Alas!  The onion you are eating is somebody else's water lilly.
So birthday wishes to me.  It's 10 o'clock and I've already received calls.  I'm just hoping that nobody calls tonight during Buffy.    So I'm doing nothing today.  Just a quiet night.  Damn I really have to get on the ball with this apartment thing, but I just like having a little cash on hand ya know.  But then I need to make friends.  Damn I'm flippant today.      So I tend to start every paragraph with 'So.'  That's what I do when I have nothing of import to say.  You'll be happy to know that my gum wrapper chain has gotten longer, and I fortified every link with a little piece of gum so that it is stronger.  These are the things I tend to do when bored at work.    I hope that I can edit this later 'cause it's sooo dull.
Forgive me friends for I have sinned... It's been so freaking long since my last confessional.  Just a little bit of my Catholic upringing reering it's ugly face.  It so weird how infused it is into my life, being that I'm like Mr. Religion-can-bite-me guy.    Anyway... I was having a personal problem last week... I couldn't find my deoderant.  I knew it was around somewhere 'cause it's not like you pick it up and walk around the house with it.  Ya know you use it and put it right back.  It's like misplacing milk... It just doesn't happen.  Well I was in my room yesterday and I saw my Life insurance policy on my table, and it hit me... Maybe it's under there.  Sure enough... Boy did I feel dumb... I was like 'Salt and Pepper my face 'cause it makes the egg taste better.'  But the funny thing is since I've received my Policy I've been more at ease that my loved ones will be taken care of if I... ya know... kick it. (and by loved ones I mean my car)  So deoderant was not as necessary.  I just marvel at the poetic nature of the snafu.  But now I'm fresh and smelling nicely...  So take comfort in that.    Later pease-blossoms
Why can't the desire to fuck be transitive?    I was pondering this on the shitter...  oops crapper... today.  Since there is a mirror right there.  I was looking at my new highlights... and I quite like them now that I've showered.  I'm mean one of the benefits of being gay is that I'm my own demographic.  I was like:    If I came up to me and hit on me I would be receptive.  Therefore it goes to reason that I would hit on me.  (I think I achieved fourth person there)    So lets take a for instance... Mike Greybeal (grrrr...  he's this dude that was on undressed for a few episodes, a major beauty on the hot scale)...  So on a given day, lets say Tuesday, I'd have sex with him.  Now if we couple this with the above, 'I'd have sex with me,' then geometry would dictate that he would have sex with me.    But then I got to thinking; you throw in a girl who has bisexual tendencies who is attracted to me, then I'd have to want to have sex with her... and this just throws a wrench in the whole rigmoroll.  So I have tucked the 'Transitive-Fuck' theory in a drawer with my other thwarted thoughts like: 'I deserve to be wealthier than the crocodile hunter,' and 'with all the Grape-Nuts in the world why is there still hunger?'    Well bye now.    PS.  I had this weird dream last night, and I'm pissed that I can't remember the Haiku that was in it... 'cause it made me laugh... well as much as a sleeping person can laugh.
I haven't put anything new up here in a while.  Soory.  I was watching TV last week, and I hit rock bottom.  FOX showed the ever-so-enthralling 'Who Wants to be a Princess?' It sucked...  and I was stupider for having watched it.  Well, there was one good part.  When they were modeling and it showed their likes and dislikes... Everyone's dislikes were like: 'Mean People,' 'Ignorant People,' 'Dishonesty,' but this one girl's was 'Moth Ball's and Hyper Dogs.'  I wanted to jump in the screen give her a big smooch and hand her the crown.  I mean how real...  I laughed for like 10 minutes solid.  But then I saw the prince, and I was like 'I'm glad she didn't win... what a troll.  I'd rather hop on Benjamin the results giver,' or as his resume would say 'Special Liaison to the Judges.'  So that's it... I think my funny went on vacay...  Maybe it's the highlights.  DAMN YOU SALAZAR!!!
I am sooooo tired today.    I mean add to the fact that I'm sick, I got like 5 hours of sleep.  Which for me is like none. I'm a sleep lover.  If sleep had the right equipment I'd sleep with it daily.  Well I guess bed thoughts kinda supplanted sex thoughts today though, maybe I am getting better.  eeeehhh... no... bad thoughts continue, but now they're all taking place in bed, whereas before they were everywhere... ya know locker rooms, prisons, atop the Seattle space needle, the usual.    The embassy was fun.  Jender and I just basically shot the shit all night, and made fun of (or more rarely complimented) all the attendees.  One woman was the undeniable reason that agoraphobia was created.  The beer lady was a trip though... she was funnnny with a capitol fun.  I liked her glasses.  Oh yeah and I got the play the didjeridu, which was an experience.    well I'm off to feign interest in my work as I contemplate my hopeful christmas gift of 600 thread count egyptian cotton sheets.  Betty so better be on the ball with that.  I mean have you ever heard of such a thing.  they are the bomb, and not just like the cherry bomb or the smart bomb, they are the H-bomb.  My sister already got hers, and I'm green with envy... or maybe that's nausea.    late...(can my goddamn nose just stop running!!!)
E-gad!!!    It's been forever since I updated this chippy.  I'm sorry I'm quite delusional right now.  I'm sick, and kinda run down.  I'm just sitting here at work waiting for my tea to steep so I can down a coupla dayquil.  But the thing that sucks (for me... well if I don't stay home) is when I'm sick all I can think about is sex.  I'm not sure if any of you suffer the same byproduct of sickness, if you do, let me know so I don't feel like such a perv.  So it makes work that much harder, so to speak.  I sign out of yahoo mail and I see that eDiets guy and I'm gone... an hour later we're living in a townhouse with two puppies and a cockatoo (his, not mine, I tried to convince him that damn bird wasn't worth it, but he's one stubborn fag).  And so it goes... all day.  It's not so much of a one track mind, but more of a one station mind where all tracks meet.  AND to top it all off I didn't win Powerball last night... These are the things I have to deal with, I mean how much can one person take?  I'm like two seconds from writing the Lottery commission and saying 'hey... If I don't start winning I'm gonna stop playing.  How do you like them apples?'  Look at me the little sicky weilding the iron fist.  I mean how else are you gonna get results?  A vague disclaimer is nobody's friend.    well off to whatever...  Austrailian Embassy tonight... I hope I fell better and don't puke on any diplomats.
Who am I????    I hooked up with some kid last night.  I think it was all about making myself feel better.  I just returned to my alma mader and I'm all feeling old and shit.  But I hope to have a fun fun weekend, I just hope butter buns doesn't give me too much flak.  God I've never done that sorta thing while other people were in the room, visiting from outta town.  that's so skanky.  That's it I'm officially a skank.  I'm off to eat some really good chinese.
I think I angered my Brother-in-law yesterday...    Ok, my bad totally, my room is getting a bit messy.  Well, up until last night, when I cleaned... majorly.    So my sister called this morning and was like 'Thanks, it looks great.'  and I'm like 'huh?' great, I just cleaned my room.  It's not like I made a chess set carved out of white potatos and sweet potatos that have been fried, so that as you win you can eat french-fried bishops and rooks and pawns.    It's not like I did that... I just cleaned my room.
I drank like two pots of coffee this morning.  Consequently I thought I was going to puke so I went home after lunch.  Ironically I felt better once I got home, what a kick.    So I popped over to Pier 1 'cause there was this blanket I wanted to get, and over to Suncoast to get a cheesy homo pic.  I never thought a movie could be this bad, but enjoyable.  I mean once you get throught the horrible story, vomit inducing acting, choppy editing, and sickening soundtrack... it bit, but the lead was HOT, so all is forgiven.  I'm such a sucker for a pretty boy.    Well off to nap my half day away.
So here's the latest cookie talk... it's like you need a decoder ring to understand it... or you can be like me and excel at piss-poor english.    Wish you a good health!    I don't even know where to begin... at least it's not bad.  Of all the fortune cookies I've ever read this is by far the most recent.
I'm bored at work.  I don't know why offices that don't have constant turnover (like stores, or factories) have to be open.  I think I'm totally not comming in tomorrow.  There's like nobody here.    So I made some changes to my template.  I like it better, I robbed some code from e, 'cause I've become HTML ignant.  But I can't find this freaking roll of film that I want to use as pictures.  I'm pissed.  But whatev.  I guess I'll just have to take some more.    God I have no funny stories.  I'm dull today.  My sister was telling me that yesterday she was riding the elevator with one of the partners of her firm.  This guy's like 50 and a partner in one of DC's largest law firms.  He was talking to her about the weather, and she was saying how it would probably not snow.  So he was like:    Partner: 'Do you ski?' Sister: 'I used to, but now I just really like sledding.'    As if it wasn't enough that my sister's barely knee high to a puppy and looks about 12, now her favorite pastimes include sledding.  Last night she was kicking herself.    Fel-lator
This is a dream I had last week:    It was a nice day at the races.  Dog? no, Horse? no, groundhog? yes.  So it was the finals of the national groundhog races and the favorite, ButterBuns, was up against the underdog, Nicky.  I wanted Nicky to win 'cause I had a nickel on him.    There was a little confusion 'cause Nicky wasn't high in the polling system, but he had won all his matches, so a challenge was extended on ButterBuns' behalf, but the Judges ruled in favor of Nicky.  BB was dressed in a Bumble bee outfit complete with fuzzy antenae.  An obvious crowd favorite to Nicky's black jersey.    And they're off!!!  ButterBuns took an early lead at 50m, but Nickey pulled it out in the last leg.  So I took my 5 g's to the victory party and got completely smashed.  It was a good day.  Even Punxatawney Phil came out, but stardom has really gotten to him, and he's been hitting the H a little too hard.  So he just sits around and waits for February when the spotlight is on him.  That prognasticating fuck, he's nothing more than a glorified coin toss.    Calc-u-lator
Well I'm back at work.  Fuck all you who aren't.  I hope everyone had a nice holiday weekend.  I did.    Holiday traditions are weird.  I don't know why.  Okay I come from a Catholic family, but I'm an Atheist, so I constantly have a battle of what i should do.  What is the least disrepectful to my family, and what is the least disrespectful to their religion.  I simply choose to abstain from most of it.  I go to Christmas eve mass, but I don't participate.  I basically just sit there and look around, usually checking out boys, but then I check myself 'cause that's not the place.  But then there's grace, and all the family talking about how nice the service was.  And I'm like 'ehh.'  It's painful.    But then we go to my cousins to eat.  This is my dad's side of the family, very Slovak.  It's fun, but 'Holy Supper' as it is called, is very shiny.  I don't know if you know about Slovakian food, but it's all cabbage, potato, and lots and lots of butter.  Every year we sit down to a meal of saurkraut soup, boiled potatos, perogies, cabbage and noodles, kielbasa and kraut, etc.  Lard basically.  But I love it.  Then Christmas day is when we get turkey and other American things.    I scored some pretty good gifts this year.  Got the Sapranos 1 & 2, sheets (only 440, but ehh, I can't stay mad at my mom), Dr. Zhivago, Rogue Leader, two pairs of shoes, a Gamecube case, and some other stuff.  Damn I'm spoiled.  I'm like 22 and I still get lots of gifts.    I talked to my Grandfather this weekend on the phone for like 20 minutes.  It was strange, I've never talked to him for more than 5 minutes, and even then it would be about computers.  But this time it was about everything.  Apparently he has a girlfriend.  Well that just pulls my cork (I don't know what it means, but my Nanny said it this weekend, she so funny, she's 85 and quite a firecracker), I can't believe my 78 year old grandfather can get a girlfriend, and I am boyless.  But anyway, he asked me if I had a girlfriend, and I'm like 'ehhh, no.'  It's not like I think that he wouldn't approve or anything, I just don't feel it's necessary to tell all the old people until ya know I'm in a relationship that last longer than a week... erm... end.  I was psyched though, I got off the phone with him and I turn to my brother and I'm like 'I'm his favorite.'    My brother was really funny this weekend though, we got drunk yesterday and apparently he wants to be on Saturday Night Live.  I'm not sure if he's up for it, but I think we come from some pretty funny stock.  We talked until like 3 in the morning.  It was fun.  I get to meet his girlfriend when I'm in NYC for New Years.  I'm psyched.    Then before I hopped in my car to return to the Nation's Cap we went over to my mom's side, very Italian.  But the ass grabbin' didn't last that long I had to get on the road.    God I'm boring today.  Recounting my holiday isn't much fun for y'ins.    In the words of my baby cousin: 'I don't wike tickows'
This is not so much of a now epiphany, but a remmberance of epiphanies past:    When I was like 4 or something my parents, like many warm, giving Americans got sucked in my Sally Struthers and Save the Children.  So we sponsored this little girl, her name was Pinky.  (Which coincidentally became the name of my first goldfish, making my porn name Pinky Washington.  With a name like that I'd have to do porn as a tranni)  So for the longest time, which was probably like a few months I thought that Pinky was actually my sister, and I couldn't figure out why she didn't live with us.  I was such a 'ron of a tyke.    Also for a while I thought that the term 'rents' (as in 'I'm living with the rents') was in reference to the fact that you should be paying rent, not a shortened version of parents.  For a smart guy I'm so dumb.    Fish and Chips and Chips and Fish Fish and Chips and Chips and Fish Fish and Chips and Chips and Fish Oh what a delicious dish!    (I hate fish and chips, but that just poped into my head, for no reason.  I'm drinking coffee for peeper's sake)
So I had sushi for lunch today and I was thinking.  I gotta find a new thing to eat, 'cause sushi (although quite satisfying without the clogged pore/enlarging thighs feeling of a BigMac) is so last year.  It's somewhere between '5 minutes ago' and 'out' on the Shaw Report.  I mean as far as food fads go it's pretty good, but when are we gonna have another bad-for-you food fad.  Why can't  Ben and Jerry's  come back into style?..  Well without all the hemp accessories and plaid.    In addition, I believe I may have ended my boycott of artificial sweeteners.  I'm drinking a Diet Coke (oops, I corrected it, but that 'coke' was originally a bad word... or rather a great word).  Finally I feel like I am actually comming into my own as a gay man.  I mean who among the human race enjoys men, and drinks exclusively straight up soda.  I mean only heteros like sugar in the can.  We prefer (a)sper(ta)m(e).    Anyway, I'm just a big goof today.    Venti-lator
Well I hope everybody is having a good Happy Stacey Day.  It's a day we invented 'cause my sister finished her last final (3rd year law school) last night.  Her name is Traci, but I call her Stacey sometimes...  'cause I have a bad memory.    I had my first Krispy Kreme doughnut today.  I can't believe I've been a KK virgin for 22 years.  It was awesome.  There's about a dozen more in the break room, but I don't want anymore, I think I'd be ruined for life, not to mention this afternoon.  Last night I forgot to eat, so I'm betting some time around 11 It'll be go time, and the more greasy the food is I eat the less pleasant the experience will be.    Tomorrow I head back to CT, the land of commuters and bad beaches.  But hell I love it.  I can't wait to see all my friends.  Then it's back here on tuesday, and back to manhattan on friday only to come back here the following tuesday.  I'm just a ping pong ball and the Delaware Memorial Bridge is my net.    Well a Happy Happy Stacey Day to you all.    Perco-lator
My new favorite thing to do is pull up at a light next to a car, turn up really loud music, like System of a Down, or Linkin Park, and make like I'm dancing to Shiney Happy People.  People look at you so strangely.
Okay so I got to thinking you all know about my thoughts and my life, but what about my subconscious?  So I decided to start this new segment call... (cue dramatic music)    NAME THAT CHILDHOOD TRAUMA!!!    It's about dreams, and if you have theories on what my dreams are about let me know.    Okay so last night I had this dream that I was at a Naval Academy graduation, not as a graduate but as a spectator.  So I come up into the stands but I'm on the wrong side.  (sidebar: I also had an ability to jump really high)  So I whip out 2 umbrellas, one of which is inside out and pointed down, and I jump really high and drift slowly towards the other side of the bleachers.  It took about 4 jumps and every time I landed on a soon-to-be alumn I realize that they're all people I knew from high school.  So I finally get to where my family is and the Admiral who is giving the key note speech said 'GOOD JOB!!!'  Then the whole stadium erupted in applause.    I have no idea either...
I have no idea what is up with people today.  Elliott in the Morning (DC101's morning show) was a veritable conucopia of nut jobs.  For 30 minutes they talked to a 60+ year old Barber in Rockville, MD who likes to wear a bra and fake 44 D's while he cuts people's hair.  So this fella, Luis, dressed up and became Luise, I felt bad after a while 'cause they were going a little far, but it was funny.  But they were also pressing him about being gay even though he said he wasn't.  I mean there is a difference between cross-dressing and homosexuality.  I thought that we all figured this out with J. Edgar.    And then afterwards some people in traffic called in and said that two girls with a camera were hanging out on the side of the road with a sign saying 'Show us your twins.'  People are so nutty some times.  I don't know if people actually obeyed their wishes, but I'm sure it was a site to see.  I wish that would happen when I'm in traffic, 'cause I get so damn bored.    Anyway, I think I'm now in love with Nick Hexum from 311(drool).  I'm gonna go fantasize now.    Oh yeah, and if anyone has a life that they can spare I'll give ya 50 bucks for it.
So for lunch today a coworker and I went to the mall 'cause he had to get a present for his little cousin.  While there and walking down the aisle I hear a punk kid (when did I turn 65?) say 'Hey there goes the faggots.'  I look around to see who he was referring to, come to find out he was talking about some uniformed military personnel.  I was a little peeved, I mean c'mon.  Especially with all the crap going on, show some respect.  Not to mention his use of the f word, I mean when my friends say it to me it's kinda funny, 'cause I know that they love me, but saying it in public.  Okay that's enough moral outrage, that's not really what this site is supposed to be about.    Well anyway I bought the new 311 CD, 'cause I like 2 songs.  I have got to stop doing this.  I mean, I just got the System of a Down CD too, and I only knew 1 song.  But whatever, I think the 311 dude has a really sexy voice, so I'll probably enjoy the rest of it.    I think I mainly pick my music 'cause I like the guy's voice.  I mean I rarely listen to female vocalists, sometimes, but not nearly as much as the fellas.  Is that wrong?  I ask you.  I mean it doesn't have to be rip your clothes off sexy, even just cute sexy.  Here's my CD changer line up right now:    1: Mix with Dave Matthews, Disturbed, etc (soon to be 311) 2: Pete Yorn 3: Gorillaz 4: Incubus 5: Linkin Park 5: System of a Down    I mean and look at my past favs:    Metallica Travis Coldplay REM Ben Folds Alice in Chains Soundgarden Tool The Beatles Limp Bizkit Michael Jackson Supergrass Billy Joel Finger 11 ...    Not a hoo-ha in the bunch.  Do I have a problem?  Maybe, but whatever... Shut up.
So Atlantic city this weekend was a lot of fun.  Although I did only spend (or waste) what I had allotted I still come away more affluently challenged than last week.  But I think it was worth it.  On the trip up Jender was a worthy companion:    (While driving through Baltimore) Jender: Look at the cruise ship! Me: Uhhh, honey... That's the Coast Guard    With conversations like that the trip was quite entertaining.  It was a little chilly though walking from the hotel to and from Ceasar's, my balls were brick-ass frozen.  And along the Miss America walk of (f/sh)ame watching Jender do the 'elbow-elbow-wrist-wrist-wrist' wave was a hoot.    But back at the Sheraton bar we had a blast.  Broke and busted we whipped out the plastic and charged up a tab.  The two bartenders were hot (one with and one without a peeper) and a lot of fun.  And the live entertainment was at a perfect volume, loud enough for you to be able to sing without bothering anyone, but quiet enough for you to converse.  Throughout the night Jender was requesting (aka screaming) 'Mr. Big, Mr. Big!!!'  But it never came, but there was some good Journey, Billy Joel, etc.  I was all 'ugn scht, ugn ahh,' during Allentown.  14 drinks and a hot-as-hell order of chicken fingers later we ended the night.    The drive back was eventful.  I caught holy hell when, BOTH of us I might add, missed the exit for the turnpike, so we ended up in Philly.    J: Should we turn around T: Um I think we can pick up 95 in Philly J: YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE T: Hey we both missed the exit and we both drove here, but I know 95 goes to Philly so I'm pretty sure we can pick it up J: PRETTY SURE, WE'RE LOST YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE T: YES I DO, THERE'S PHILLY, if we don't hit 95, we can turn around J: JUST 'CAUSE WE CAN SEE PHILLY DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE T: CALM DOWN J: DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN, WE'RE LOST (Lo and Behold we come up on 95) T: See we're okay. J: (laughing) We fight like a married couple.    So we made it home actually faster than if we didn't go through PA, 'cause we didn't hit any stop lights.  All in all, a successful road trip.
Dear readers I brought my car in for service today.  I think the guy was a little peeved that it's like 7k past due.  He got the 'mommy/daddy bought that for you ya brat and you can't take care of it' look on his face.  Meanwhile I'm scrimping and saving to make the payments (shuttup).  And I'm like 'Um...and...um...I got a dent...and if you get a chance could you check it out...um...'  I'm so not forcefull.  I have no power.  I can't remember the last time I had any power.  And I'm not talking sexual power, or conversational power, 'cause I've had that, I'm talking social status power.  Oooh, ooh, I remember:    Picture it, Connecticut 1989.  My brother's team just won the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA and I'm feeling a little unattended, if you will.  So as I enter the fifth grade I obtain the most coveted position an elementary school student could have:  Bus Patrol.  [CUE EERIE MUSIC]  Not only did I get the fashonably blinding orange belt/Miss america sash, but I got a badge.  Okay I don't know about your neck of the woods but in our precinct the badges worked like this:    No Trim: Patrol  Red trim: Sergeant (Walkers) Green trim: Lieutenant (1 per bus) Blue trim: Captain (2 per school)    So me and one of my friends (who was my grade nemesis to my parents, but I could give too shits about grades, I haven't come too far) were the Captains.  Captain Horton and I ran the monthly meetings.  In addition I had carte blanche for 20 minutes a day 'cause I was the first bus stop in the morning and the last in the afternoon.  And at any time I could boss people around or even...  SIT IN THE BACK!!!  It was like the holy grail to single digit peeps.  I loved it in the rear (I definitly haven't come too far).  But as a fair an impartial emperor, I joke I mean captain, I joke I mean RULER! I invoked the Magna Carta of Bus #13 agreements (okay Lietunant Cohen helped draft it, I couldn't spell well, damn I'm like the same person as I was 12 years ago, just with better fashion sense, and without the two inch lenses warping my NOSE FOREVER... I'm bitter).  This agreement was an organized schedule that placed the 6 patrols in pairs (A, B, and C) on a weekly rotating schedule for sitting in the front, middle and REAR.  This way if any of the yungsters had problems a patrol would be within 4 seats and also a patrol would always be in the emergency exit row.    So as my brother was getting free trips to Yankee Stadium, Shea and Fenway I was taking my anger out on 4th graders.  Especially that kid, something Weiner, he was such a cock.    Oh to weild that sort of power again...
Okay I'm starting a new recurring entry type today.  It's called Epiphany.  It's for when I discover that I've been stupid for years thinking one thing when it's completely false.    Here's a warmer: I Never knew that there was no such word as 'reoccurring'.  I tried using it in my earlier entry and checked my spelling and lo and behold, not there.  I'm sure e is like 'Finally, that fucking moron makes my ears bleed every time he says it.'  Yeah I know how you are.    And here's the real one: Okay, just a few days ago I realized that on the Monopoly board those are not ghosts in the Community Chest, they're bags of money.  I always thought they were demented little ghosts with their beedy little eyes.  Now it makes sense, I've always preferred Chance, and every time I'd pick up a CC card I'd be filled with a strange fear. check it out a see if you can see how my fucked up brain Rorschached  this .
I think I have a tapeworm... again!  I'm freaking hungry from the word go.  So I have moved into my antiparasitic mode.  Smoke, starve, etc.  anything to get rid of it.  (I'm actually kidding here I don't actually think it's true)  So water only for my uninvited cohibitant.    Last night I had a dream that I was at a concert and my baby got hit.  Sgt. Hughes was all banged up, I was quite distraught.  I never actually got to see the Moody Blues.  That's a recurring dream for me.  Going to a concert and not making it out of the parking lot for one reason or another, but it's usually 'cause of drinking, drugs (which I don't even use), or other debauched activities.  I wonder why.  At least it's not teeth falling out, I hear that's about anxiety, and it only makes me more anxious.    So I bought Pikmin for GameCube yesterday.  It's actually a lot of fun, but kinda involved.  Those little guys are kinda cute, and the little space man is awww-dorable.  We'll see how it pans out.    I hope AC goes well.  I think I'm gonna buy a powerball ticket too.  I read that it was my golden month, so I'm hoping I can score big.  Actually e read it to me.  It was in some summer issue in Jane.  But it did say I'd get a job in August (which I did), and get some lovin' in October (well my skank activity was in November, but I'm a late Libra), so maybe.  Or maybe it means that I'm finally gonna buy ABBA Gold (that's what Jender and I are gonna listen to on the way to Sodom... I mean Atlantic City).  Well either way I'm happy.    Tonight is the finale of The Amazing Race, and it has been a trip, let me tell you.  It seems like such a cool show to be on, even if you lose you at least get to go to some cool places and do some cool shit.  I don't know who I want to win though.  Team Guido is way back (thank god, they give homos a bad name).  So it's between Rob and Brennan (the hot lawyers), and Frank and Margarita (the separated couple),  I think my vote is for F&M 'cause it looks like they may be able to patch things up and there's a kid involed in that relationship.  I just hope those crazy kids can work it out.  Well it would help if Frank would stop being abusive, which, to his merit, he seems to have turned it around lately.  But now that Kevin and Drew are outta it I don't care too much, those guys were a laugh riot.    I'm hungry, or rather my flatworm cohort is, but I think I'm gonna stall him until 1.  Sorry for the randomness of this entry.
So did you watch 24 last night?  WOW.  That show rocks.  This is what my life has been boiled down to.  Doesn't it suck.  No really, I'm just kidding.  I think I'm just getting my interholiday bumms.  It happens every year.    Well I'm really looking forward to AC this weekend (that's Atlantic City to the laymen [mmmm...lay-men, yes sir.  Sorry]).  I'm planning on winning about 50-grand...  I mean give or take.    Ooh, ooh, I was thinking this the other day, I'm always so positive when gambling.  I'm all like I'm gonna win powerball, I'm gonna rock at roulette, Ed McMahon already has my number, that eDiets guy shops at my grocery store and we're gonna get it on.  Ya know stuff like that.  And then I get stuck with people comming up to me after asking how it turned out, well low and behold I'm empty handed.  So not only were my dreams dashed but fuckin' people rub it in.  One of these days I'm tellin' ya, I'm gonna win and nobody's gonna believe me.  I know what you're thinking: 'loser.'  Well how 'bout I pop off one of your antennas and throw it across the yard.  Then who's the loser, you or me?    But anyway I'm hoping I'm gonna be able to stick to my 'I have this much to play with and I can't lose any more.'  'cause I think I'm highly susceptible to the fever.
So I was peeing in the urinal yesterday when it hit me.  I prefer street shopping in the winter.    Why you ask?  Well here's my reason.  In the winter when you street shop the natural light is dim, making for highly reflective glare free store windows.  And we all know about the expansive and contractatory (I made up that word right?) properties of glass.  So when the inside tempurature is warmer than the outside temperature it makes the inner plane of the window slightly larger than the outer plane, thus creating a slightly concave surface.  This makes you look thin and beautiful.  Generally panes of glass are taller than they are wide, if you are walking past a store where the pane is wider than it is tall, look away, it will only make you look short.  Conversely in the summer you look fat.  This is a variation on the hall of mirrors attraction at amusement parks.  Be forwarned that this is not always the case as some new windows are installed more snug than others to allow for settling and foundation frost heaving.    I know what you're thinking, 'Damn that was a long pee.'  Well your right, I think I drink too much coffee in the morning.    So then I shook it twice ('cause any more and I'd be playing with it), and went back to my desk.
So I think I'm getting stupid...  and it sucks.    Some time last week I was on the phone in the back yard smoking, when I finished my cigarette I proceeded to come inside.  The sliding door was open so I just walked in...walked in is right...right into the screen door.  My brother-in-law still busts on me for that.    A few days later I take another way home right, to avoid traffic.  So I'm driving down the street (in the opposite direction from what I usually do) and I notice that there are a lot of cars parked.  So I pick a spot between two unfamiliar cars thinking maybe someone's having a party.  Parallel park effortlessly, it was great.  Then I get out and approach the door, finally it dawns on me.  'Where's the huge mound and trees?'  I was about a block short of my house, so I stood there for a few minutes trying to decide weather to move the car or just walk, finally I decide to move it.  So I walk up to the door, put the key in, and guess what... it doesn't turn.  I got all embarrassed and pissed, then I realized that I just didn't put it in far enough, so I went inside defeated.    On a completely different topic I was watching Trading Spaces with my sister this weekend and Vern was painting a room red, the walls and the ceiling, and my sister and I got to talking:    Traci: Vern likes Red. Me: Vern really likes Red. Traci: Red is Vern's favorite color. Me: Vern loves Red. Traci: Vern really loves Red. Me: Vern's gonna marry Red.    I really think some good points were brought up in that conversation so I thought I'd share.
Okay it's been a while since I've put some of these up, but I was waiting for some good ones.    Well first off when I was in Pitt like ages ago (if you recall this was the skank day) I went out to eat with a coupla friends.  And strangly enough we all got the same fortune:    Prejudice is the child of ignorance.    At least it wasn't bad, and kinda informative.  Also the Pitt delt me this one:    What makes an Apple fall to the ground?    Well I'm no physisist, but this doesn't strike me as the brain buster it's portrayed as.  Finally this weekend I got what experts believe is the best fortune ever:    You are almost there.    Shortly after reading this I DID in fact arrive at a destination.  WOW, isn't that creapy!!!
So I was going to write today about how I'm getting stupid, but that's gonna have to wait 'cause I am a GENIUS.    I'm sitting in work trying to figure out something to do and I get some coffee.  It tastes really bitter and strong.  So I'm like 'I wish someone could combine the manly bean flavor of coffee with the smooth leaf flavor of tea.'  Well someone can.  So I steeped tea in already strong coffee.  The bitterness was removed.  I can't decide whether to call it Coffeete or Teaffee.    I'm telling ya this thing is like the closest thing you can get to opium (yeah whatever like I'd know).  I'm so high on caffiene right now.  SHUT UP LITTLE LEPRECHAUN MAN I'M TRYING TO TYPE!    Anywho, I emplore you all to give it a whirl, but only if you don't have to drive for at least 6 hours.  I think it's gonna be the trademark drink at 'The Daily Grind'.    Oh shit...gotta run...comming down...    UPDATE:    Okay nevermind.  DON'T TRY THIS.  There is no way I'd get FDA approval.  I almost puked a little while ago, and my heart is beating at an unprecedented rate.  I need a valium.  These DTs suck.  I'm through with Teafee, I'm glad I got that monkey off my back... On an unrelated note I'm looking forward to a weekend of drinking and debauchery.
Okay so I was walking in Georgetown this past weekend and I was thinking.  I should open a coffee house... I'd call it 'The Daily Grind.'  Get it?  I think it's cute in a quarky way.  Once I get that inexhaustible source of income I'm set.  Then you all can take a break from your daily grind and stop in for some coffee.  I wouldn't be there though 'cause I'd have so much money I wouldn't be friends with the likes of you anymore.    Well, here's to wishing I'll never see your ugly mug anymore!!    Just kiddind... Ta-ta
Someone remind me never to drink tea in the afternoon.  Especially when it's useasonably warm outside.  God it's like I'm having hot flashes...  Oh shit... maybe it's menopause.  Great like I need to have another reason I'm not going to have kids.  Like keeping my cell phone in my pocket near my buddies and smoking aren't enough reason.  Not to mention the fact that all ovum are banned from sexual encounters involving me.    Well back to my desk.  It's cooler in that corner of the room anyway.
So I really need to do something about how this looks huh?  Well I'm lazy.  So screw you!  But anyway, I haven't put anything up here in like a week.  I can't think of anytrhing funny to write about.    Well yesterday bit...(commence bitch) I had a swift 2 hour commute in the morning - BLAHHHH!!  Some 18 wheeler bottomed out...  It was like someone took the two ends of it and snapped it, like a popoid (remember popoids, I used to make popoid cars and pilot them with my weebles).  So that was a pain in my tushie.  Then my evening drive to Tysons to meet Jender for a lovely dinner (Thai) was trafficky too.  And there was an accident on the way home from the mall.  I completed the beltway in one day yesterday and it only took 4 hours in the car ARGHH!  But I think it was worth it, 'cause when we were in the Gap I was like 'I like those jeans,' and Jender was like 'I like that Mannequin's ass,' I about lost it.    Well I think that's it.  Later.
So I'm thinking (this just means passing thought, not definite) of getting a nose job.  I snore okay.  I would like to fix that... well that and I hate my nose like huge-time.  I surfed for a bit to see how much it'd set me back, and they only run like 3 grand.  Maybe next year.  I just don't know how to explain the time off, or the different nose to people at work.  Am I incredibly vain?  Well of course.  Aren't we all. What do you think?  I mean I don't really think it'd be a waste of money, say I'm gonna live for like at least 40 more years, that's just pennies a day. (wait lets calculate: 3000/(40*365.25) = $0.21) It's totally fiscally responsible.
Pull up a chair and mainline the ginko it's time for last night's dream:    I'm at home with my sis and her husband about to watch a movie, so we dim the lights.  All of a sudden the wind seems to pick up and a tree flys by the window.  I'm like 'Look that tree has many trunks.' And then the wind began to switch the house to pitch and suddenly the hinges started to unhitch just then the witch, to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick thumbing for a hitch.  So we high tailed it outta there and headed for the beach, which as we all know is the only safe place during times of hurricane.  I dimly recall how I saw in a movie that if there's a hurricane and you're on the beach head south since hurricane's travel north.  But since we were on the west coast it was reversed.  To get a better view of the situation my mother (um, hi mom, when did you get here) suggested that we ride the ferris wheel.  From that vantage point we could see what remained of our house and the fact that the winds had died down.  So we two step it back to the neighborhood hoping there's something left...    On the way we run into my sister's friend, she and her husband were okay, but it seemed that the 'cane had swallowed up their dog Josh (which is sad 'cause I love Josh, he's like the only dog I've really liked.  I told Jender that I liked dogs with people names and she's like 'what like Margerie,' and I'm like 'I said dogs not bridge partners.').  So I'm totally bumbed out by this Josh is gone thing, so I go out with some high school friends...    We running-man up to the top of a really tall building.  I'm like 'Hey my house got blown up by that 'cane.'  And they're like 'really.'  I was pissed that they didn't care more.  Then my friend Steph is like 'look at this ad I saw in the Catholic Journal.'  And it's a guy with his hand on a balcony pulling himself up.  It's like a anti-suicide ad, and the caption said 'When you're holdin' Your golden.'  It was like even when you've jumped it's not too late to grab onto anything.  It went on to say that it's okay, all you need is a good grasp, because then the hair products you use will get cought by the wind and carry the  majority  of your weight to saftey.  Unfortunately our hair product booted us over the edge.  As we fell we grabbed onto the 1st floor balcony and were saved.  I was still upset from the apathy of my friends so I was like 'I'm going for ice cream'...    I get the the ice cream counter and the cute attendant slips my a dark chocolate scoop for free.  Then this girl Amber sits next to me and I proceed to hit on her and successfully pick her up, which is funny 'cause I don't like chocolate ice cream.  She didn't get what she wanted either so she complained.  Wackyness ensued and we get chased outta there by this b(i/u)tch woman.  We end up switching ice creams, it was sickenly sweet a spectacle.  How hetero...    We go to see a movie and back to her place for some drinks, meanwhile I'm like 'what time is it.' She's like '6 why?' I'm like 'I was supposed to catch some gay porn on VH1 at 11, but I guess I missed it.'  After a few drinks she start kickin' it into high gear, and I'm feeling all experimental and I'm like as long as my pants stay on I'm not straight.  (I don't get the reasoning either)  So I was all about pleasing her and did some things I will not go into, not because they're graphic, but because I don't want to remember that. ever.  Regaurdless I was all about pleasing her, which is weird 'cause I'm selfish in bed (hehe).  So she was happy...    The next day I go to work as a waiter in this upscale bar.  As I'm waiting the tables I see Amber and she calls me over to where her friends are.  It turns out that she's kinda a professional woman.  Not like a ho, but rather a girl who hangs out with hot guys who have money so they don't have to buy anything.  She turns to her friend, Shoe, another golddigger (what the hell kinda name is that), and is like 'This guy knows how to treat a woman,' Shoe: 'He's that good.' Amber: 'Def.'  So Amber goes to town on Shoe while Shoe is licking my eyelid, which I don't know if it feels this good in real life ('lick my eyelid' is not really in my pillow-talk repertoire) but I was likin' it big time...    I bolted up from unconsciousness with pink eye and thinking 'am I a lesbian?'
I spent so much money yesterday, and more to come this weekend.  I bought a new down comforter, pillow, and mattress.  I can't wait to hook it all up, with my 440 ct sheets, I'm never gonna wanna get outta bed.  WOOHOO!!  I'm gonna get the mattress delive-d on tuesday.  Hopefull by then I'll already have the bed frame and desk I want.  I'm so 'cited.    Do you ever listen to music and it brings you back to a time forgotten?  Recently XTC's  Dear God  has been taking me back to last spring.  I guess it's in part due to the fact that it's fucking hot out in the District.  But it just reminds me of when I was moving out of Pittsburgh and I was cooking everything in my freezer.  I'd make like 5 meals a day.  I think one day I made burgers, perogies, two kinds of rice, two kinds of pasta, and pork chops.  That was fun.  I was like pouring olive oil on everything.  I guess that's the guinea in me (is that how you spell that?  or is that like a country?  I'm not sure, where do you even look up the spelling of racial epithets?).   Offensive Slang  . Used as a disparaging term for a person of Italian birth or descent.  IT IS!  Go me... get funky... it's my birthday!
Guess what I saw on the way to work today (a perk of living in the Nation's Capital)?  Now don't quote me on this 'cause I have other theories too, but I saw what I think was a Harrier Jet.  I was driving along and I'm like 'that jet is moving really slow.'  A little later I notice that it prety much wasn't moving at all.  I mean I could be wrong, 'cause I was in traffic and delusional.  It was either that or a jet shaped baloon, or maybe a jet on a stick.  But then again it was green wheras in  True Lies  it was grey.  Do you think the Harrier Jet comes in more than one color?  I'd like to get one in sky blue, 'cause I'd be virtually invisible to people on the ground.  Oh the possibilities...
So I checked the MTV fantasy thing, and unfortunately e kicked my ass! (something like 268 to 170)  BITCH!  Just kidding, I won't know the break down until tonight, I could only check out the total score.  'Paging Mr. Bigfatstupidloser?, Mr. Bigfatstupidloser your mother wants you home by 9.'    Other than that I have nothing to say today.  Ehh.  Fuck it.  I'm having a blah blah day.  But tonight is new  Buffy , so happy Trav.    I love you all, but d'ya know what I love more?  No, not anonymous sex.  Nicotine.  Off to smoke.  Late    PS.  I think someone got here by searching for 'thalky' on google, I hope they weren't looking for my bro or sis.  I should've picked something less confusing.  I'm stupid.  But in college people would call me 'Alky Thalky,' 'cause I'd drink like a horse, and it just kinda stuck (well in my head at least, nobody really calls me that anymore)
So my new, or revisited, obsession right now is the Real World.  and with MTV doing the fantasy challenge for the battle of the seasons I'm giddy (and more than a bit pathetic).  I encourage all of you to sign up and make a team, then let me know what your name is so we can compete, ya know... like losers.  I already made e do it.  But today is the last day.    GO HERE   if you wanna have fun too. Or just waste some time.    I think I want to apply again (want to again, not apply again).  I've always just put it off.  But I think it'd be fun.  I'm such a waste of space sometimes.  I just want adventure.  Maybe I should just get lost in Jersey again.    Whatever, happy monday, and good luck with your teams (I know none of you will actually do it, and I say fuck you... I'll be having fun, and what will you be doing?  HUH?  Yeah that's right, nothing.)    PS 4 days until moving (well maybe 5, but 4 sounds better)
Happy friday to all.    I think I'm gonna check out today at 3 'cause it's happy weekend, and the earlier I leave the less traffic I hit.  I'm in a good mood, but I just got to work, so I wonder how long that will last.    My sister was so moody and funny last night.  We were sitting and she was whining about chocolate, so she wanted me to get her a cookie dough Slim Fast bar (Okay, is the concept lost on me, or are those things supposed to be for lunch, not a post dinner snack), so I kept going to the kitchen and firing back the wrong ones.  Apparently we have like 4 types of bars in the house.  But she couldn't catch (maybe it's genetic, oh wait my brother can catch, and she's a girl and I'm a fag), so it hit her in the eye.  For the rest of the night she's like 'Am I swollen,' so I got her mind off it by saying, 'No, but one of your eyebrows is like an inch lower than the other.  You need to wax.'  I know it's not the nicest thing to say, but she was annoying.  Then a game of cards solved it all.
I got really angry at my hair last night 'cause it's kinda long.  That bitch didn't cut it short enough.  Seriously I was like an inch from being sent to that island ( see last entry ).  So I whipped out the scissors and started cutting.  Don't get me wrong I wasn't like sculpting, I mean I'm no Edward Scissorhands.  I just thinned out the burns and cut a little off the back so it wouldn't curl under, it usually buys me a week and a half.  But now I have a bald line through my right sideburn.  I'm all sheepish.  But if anyone brings it up I have the perfect homo cover:      Person : What happened to your hair.  Me:      I know.  See I was trying to save some money for this new Kenneth Cole jacket so I went to Supercuts.  Big mistake.  I will never do that again.  There gonna hear from my lawyer in 2 to 4 days.  I should have known.  From now on only Dominique touches my hair.  She's a miracal worker with my roots.  I'm sorry I have to jam.  I'm off to Saks to pick up a new hat to cover this mop.     Whatta ya think?  Do you buy it?
Boo!    Did I scare ya?  I'm cold right now.  I always get cold after lunch.  I guess it's 'cause it's the only time during the day I drink cold beverage.  God that was neither informative nor entertaining.  So I was looking through EW this week, and I came across an ad for  40 Days and 40 Nights  and I have to admit I'm intrigued.  I mean the movie is gonna suck, big time, but I'll probably see it.  I mean Josh Hartnett forgoing all forms of sex for lent.  It must be fraught with sexual tension and inuendo.  Fun, Fun.  I on the other hand have never, nor will I ever, give up anything for lent.  I don't get it.  Even for religious folk.  How is that 'proving yourself to god' or some such shit.  I would always mock give up stuff like: Homework, or taxes, or better yet women.    Did I tell you guys...  wait I'll do a little search.  I guess not.  I work with a Tom Jones.  I think that's so funny.  I told someone this the other day and they started to laugh, so I'm like 'It's not unusual.'  In addition to that I work with a Brian Wilson, and it's fun fun fun, just like lying in bed.  To top it all off I think I heard a page once for a Dennis Hopper, but I'm looking into that.  Sorry for the pittiful puns.    Come on 5 o'clock... Come to daddy!
I forgot my phone again today. FUCK!!!    But regaurdless, I think I'm moving next weekend.  I just gotta give the complex a call and make sure I can get a parking space.  Woo-Hoo!!  I'm psyched.  You can't see me, but I'm doing the running man right now.  God I wore out so many shoes and stubbed so many toes in the early 90's with that.  What in god's name were we thinking.  I mean dancing is supposed to be sexy (to an extent) or at least beautiful.  When was the last time you said 'WOW!  Look  at that guy, he can run in place for hours while making ear-piercing noises with his Chuck Taylor's.  That is HOT!'  Or the cabbage-patch, I used to have a friend that was all about the cabbage-patch.  I would never dance with her 'cause she was uncoordinated and I got bruised.      So we made up our own, hot-hot dance moves like: Picking-up-the-change, climbing-the-wall, locking-the-door, and other daily activities, seemingly mundane, but foxy when the envelope was pushed.  Who am I kidding, it was just to make eachother laugh.  Getting 'sexy' outta those dances was like getting water from a rock.    Well I'm gonna go back to my silent desk and dream about furniture.
Okay yeah I know I already updated this once this afternoon, but I have something to say now.    I don't know about the rest of you, but when I go out for a smoke I want a peaceful time to be with my thoughts, I DON'T want to make small talk with air-filter-replacing-mullet-man.  I mean what am I supposed to say 'when are you gonna wake up and smell the 'mullets-suck'.'  I mean, to some extent, they're beautiful, like all nature.  But like other critters they are to be observed occasionally for entertainment in their natural habitat, such as monster truck shows, wrestling matches, and country bars, not thrust into our world causing confusion and upheaval.  I was almost tempted to say, 'Honey, we don't talk to the help.'  What is a person to do when confronted with raw nature in an otherwise baked environment?  Do we A) nod and respond with short/noncommital phrases, or B) whip out the sheers and conduct displacement experiments?  I chose A, but B was eating away at me.  Maybe, to ensure the safety of everyone, especially the children, we should put them all on an island.    Well at least I was out there long enough to see cute firemen in uniforms.
I'm not sure if this is a valid feeling.  Yesterday they came around with a card for a gift for one of my coworkers who had a baby.  This happens quite frequently.  I get kinda irked.  I don't know why.  Originally it was because I was here for a very short time.  Actually I saw the first one of them on my second day.  And since then there have been like 3 or so babies and 2 or so weddings.  I'm not made of money.  I know it's not a lot to give.  I can't figure out if that's the reason or it's just me being jealous of things that I will never have.  Go figure.  I could be that someone came by with a happy birthday sign and some candy for me yesterday.  It's not my birthday.  There is another Travis who started like last week, I guess it was his.  I didn't know they did such things here, since in my third month of working here my birthday came and left with no peanutbutter cups.  Can you still see me?  oh wait... you can't.    Sorry I'm in a funk, I think it's 'cause Im trying to get a heads up on the crest white strips 'cause I'm not gonna be home Friday, so I doubled up.  And man do my teeth hurt right now.    AC S-later
I had a very interesting weekend.  Psha.  I did absolutely nothing.  I think the highlight of it was playing Egyptian Rat Screw with my sister.  I'm such a loser.  But she's so wacky sometimes.  She was really getting into it.  After ever game she'd be like 'I'm getting all swetty.'  She was a slapping fiend.  But I did get to watch  Newsies  and I almost cried, I would have if I didn't think Traci would get on me for it.  I just love that movie.  Maybe it's all the cute boys (okay, a good portion of them are of legal age, the others, well that's just sick) singing and dancing, and fighting.    Also I got quite a lot of QAF in.  I'm finally to episodes I've never seen.  I've come to the realization that it's not as bad as I had originally thought.  Strangely enough the lesbians are the best actors in the bunch, and are a large part of why I continue to watch.  Okay all the naked men contribute.  But I have a HUGE problem with the whole this is Pittsburgh thing.  I mean I lived there for four years and it's not that cool.  And they talk about the Susquehanna, okay dude there are three rivers in Pittsburgh and that is not one of them.  It's like 100 miles away in Harrisburg.  They also bring up my car: 'The Audi TT is a fuck machine, the guys who drive it usually aren't.'  Well... They just haven't met me... err... yeah that's it.    Well I'll hit you back when I'm awake later in the day.    By the way, is anyone else at work, I mean it's MLK day, show some respect.  I wanna go home.
I think this is why I'm in such a good mood:     Let's do it     Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money  So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey  Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'  I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'  Introduce myself as Loc she said 'You're a liar'  I said 'I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire'  Took her to the hotel she said 'You're the king'  I said 'Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing  Wild thing  Wild thing     Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy  I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly  She looked at me and smiled and said 'You have plans for the night'  I said 'Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight'  So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other  I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother  I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string  She said 'Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing'  Wild thing  She loved to do the wild thing  Wild thing  Please baby baby please     Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype  And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type  Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine  The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine  Took her to the limousine still parked outside  I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride  Couldn't get her off my jack she was like static cling  But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing  Wild thing  She wanna do the wild thing  Please baby baby please  Wild thing     Doin' a little show at the local discotheque  This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck  She want to come on stage and do her little dance  So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance  So when the show was finished I took her around the way  And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say  We was all alone and she said 'Tone let me tell you one thing  I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing'  Say what  Yo love you must be kidding  You're walkin' babe  Just break out of here  Hasta la vista baby  Wild thing.
It's almost the weekend.  I'm working hard (strangely enough), but ecstatic.  I've changed modes from listening to music just at my desk, to wearing my earphones all around the office.  I get weird looks, but it makes me a happier worker.    I'm listening to that Carbon Leaf song.  I've been talking about it way too much this week.  Sorry. No I'm not, I have to put up with your shit like all the time, the least you can do is humor me for one goddamn minute!    I can't wait to do absolutely nothing this weekend.  I'm gonna watch the rest of QAF and Buffy, but that's about it.  I'm not even going to do laundry.  Oh shit I think I have to cook dinner for T & J this weekend.  Just in case I leave my sister's like you better cook for us.  I think I'm just gonna brown some chicken breast in olive oil and make some pasta.  Hell I like it.  And maybe throw together some Italian wedding soup. yum yum, bubble gum, in my tum, 'gimme some!'    I'm in such a weird mood today.  I don't know if it's 'cause it's such a nice day, but who the hells knows.  I surely don't.  I kinda wish I had a digital video camera 'cause the birds were around again and I wanna show y'ins 'cause it's really cool.    Oh they were talking about Heinz field today on the radio and how some of the players from some other team were told to 'mark their territory.'  So they peed on the field.  I only wish that I had peed on it when I broke in 'cause then I'd call the station and be like 'well I already marked it.'    Well that's about it right now.  (I have to fight the urge to do a cartwheel down the halls of the office.  Does this happen to anyone else?  I just can't help grinning today.)
I'm thinking of making up a faux excuse to go home.  Here's how the conversation would go:    T: I have to go I have an Appointment Mr. Boss Man, Mr. Big Boss, Mr. BOSS MAN BING!: With whom? T: Um... Errr... Um... My... Chronologist. BMB: Why are you seeing a Chronologist? T: He puts my life in order *rim shot*    Then the harp I stole from Scrooge McDuck start singing; 'You are fibbing, fibbing, Fiiiiiibbiiiiing.' and Flintheart Glomgold swipes my stud finder, as the Beagle Boys make off with my car, and Magica DeSpell turns me straight (ewww.), and Launchpad and Doofus continually trip in the corner while Webby plays dress-up with Bubba.    What was I talking about again?     Life is like a hurricane here in Duckburgh Racecars lasers airplains it's a duck-blurr might solve a mystery or rewrite history
I'm getting so sick of  Creed .  I mean it's not like I don't like the music, but c'mon.   My Sacrifice  is no second comming of Christ.  Actually right now, I think due to my long commute, Im sick of quite a lot of bands, here's a short list: Creed Lenny Kravitz Red Hot Chili Peppers Jane's Addiction Smashing Pumpkins Dave Matthews Band    This is not to say that I don't like any of this music, it's just lay off the repeat.  And what is with Duncan Sheik?  Since when is  Barely Breathing  in heavy rotation?  I think I was on the East-Bumble-Fuck station.  I mean you just have to save a little of your fame for later use.  I mean we all know what happens when you overplay.  Any one of these could be you: Hootie Cranberries Spin Doctors Hanson (ewwww) TLC    Forgive me if I put any one-hit-wonders in there, I was going for one big album, one ok album, than jack.    I don't know what this rant was about, but whatever.  I can't wait to get DSL, 'cause Amazon alone has all these downloadable  songs .  Especially  The Boxer , I have no speakers at work, so I can't.  But if you do, give it a listen.  Or at least the sample.
I'm like a zombie right now, and I've been sitting in a strange position for the past 2 hours so my butt's kinda asleep.    This morning I loaded my phone up with Travis song, so that's what I've been listening to.  But I'm feeling kinda losery 'cause I keep getting  Baby One More Time  in my head (Travis made a version of this, that's actually pretty good).  Well less than an hour 'till I get to go home.    I'll leave you with a song:  Kookaburra sits on an old gum tree Merry merry king of the bush is he Laugh Kookaburra Laugh Kookaburra Gay your life must be   ALL TOGETHER NOW   Kookaburra sits on an old gum tree Eating all the gumdrops he can see Stop Kookaburra stop Kookaburra Save some gums for me   ONE MORE TIME!   Kookaburra sits on an old gum tree Counting all the monkeys he can see Stop Kookaburra stop Kookaburra That's no monkey that's me     I don't know about you, but that woke me up.    ONE MORE TIME!
Hey did anyone see the AMA's I didn't, but everyone (I mean radio) is talking about  urlLink Carbon Leaf  and I've heard one song on the radio.  It's big into the Irish thing, which I know is a little passe, but it's pretty darn-tootin' good.  But they're not really signed, so you can only get there CD in Richmond, which I'm not treking out there for a CD.  I'll just scour the web, when I get DSL.    So as the days progress I'm approaching definite on this apartment.  The deal is just pretty hard to pass up.    I was in Best Buy yesterday (there's a fuckin' surprise) and I got a little nervous due to my purchases.  I don't think I'm completely comfortable wearing my sexuality on my sleve, and that kinda bothers me.  I mean the way I dress it's a definite, but...  I don't know.  I just made the gayest purchase.  I bought Buffy Season 1, Newsies, Queer as Folk Season 1, and Moulin Rouge.  I mean I might as well been wearing capris pants and a midrif.  Am I a bad fag, or is my trepidation warranted?    But now it's work again.  I don't want to be here.  Just 8 more hours.  Well off to waste my youth and beauty at a computer.
My last entry got me thinking:    Would you rather be smart, like us (only my friends read this and I'm not friends with stupid people.  Except...  well I don't want to get anyone mad at me) and pretty, like us (only my friends read this and I'm not friends with ugly people.  Except...  well I don't want to get anyone mad at me)...    OR.................................    Be dumb, like Melissa Rivers, and gorgeous like Mike Greybeal (or Jessica Alba for the ladies... actually she a great example, 'cause she's shit-rocks dumb)?    That's the big question, and I don't have an answer.  I would instinctively say 'I'd like to be like me,' but I would like to test out being ultra pretty.  Just for a month.  Can you imagine the ass you'd be able to get?  And maybe those stunads don't realize what it's like to have thoughts about the future, the world, politics, global warming, mandatory waiting periods for firearms acquisition, etc.    As Thomas Gray says: To each his suff'rings; all are men, Condemn'd alike to groan,â  The tender for another's pain, Th' unfeeling for his own.  Yet ah! why should they know their fate, Since sorrow never comes too late, And happiness too swiftly flies? Thought would destroy their paradise.  No more; where ignorance is bliss, 'T is folly to be wise.     And as Jessica Alba says: HUH?    Speaking of dumb my sister asked me for a review of fractions.  I started laughing at her: This comming from the girl who got one of the 2 A+'s in Criminal Procedure, I mean incredibly intelligent, but she wants a mult/div fraction lesson.  I told her to just use a calculator, and she's like 'I was going to until my friends were talking about the final saying how they couldn't believe how some stupid people brought calculators to the exam.'  She was sheepish, it was cute.
Go me, I'm 3 lbs from my target weight.  I just checked this morning, but I don't know how reliable one weighing instance is.  'cause sometimes you havn't eaten in a while, or you drank a lot of water, or you took a really big shit, what have you.  So I hope it's for real.    My morning and evening routines have gotten longer.  I'm back on the Crest White strips.  They're the kick.  I think my teeth are currently at an acceptable level of whiteness.  (they were pretty bad before I did them in November)  Now I have a week and a half left.  So that twice a day.  Then I have like 6 new facial products to use, whereas before I had 1 (if that).  Also I shave like daily now, 'cause I don't want to put all crazy skin shit on my hairy faccia.  All in all I think it's working out, but my eyes are getting more easily tired.  And thanks to Jender and Swank for recommending Bumble and Bumble.  I like the styling creme.  (WHAT A FAG!)    And with my target weight almost accomplished I think that I may be ready to start working out.  (I have an easier time losing fat than transforming fat to muscle)  I can start with a blank slate (wait, it's clean slate, blank canvas.  I'm such a dumb-ass)    I just want to be pretty.
Gee-Whiz I am sleepy.  I was up last night watching the Sopranos with my sis.  That show is the bee's knees.  I'm so psyched to have HBO if I move into that place.  And MTV considering the new season of Real World starts tomorrow.    I had a Hitchcockian moment earlier today.  I go outside for a nic-break right, and there are like 200 birds perched on the other building.  Then they swoop down into the trees that line the sidewalk in like a steady stream.  It was pretty cool.  I just wish they were louder (like crows not like chirp-chirp) and it was night.  I love having 'Birds' moments.  It's so spookey and fun.  But they were gone the next time I went out.    I forgot my phone again today.  I'm such a lame-ass.    Knob-it,
So I checked out that place, and I'm gonna give it a favorable review.  Not because it's so rad, but because I'd have money to have fun with.    It'd save me like 5 C-notes a month.  And we all know how I like to spend.  So I'm jazzed.  Speaking of which I'm all about this line of Crate and Barrel shit.  I'm looking for some pics to link to.   Desk  and  Bed  Do ya like it?  There's also these  shelves     And my sis showed me this crap she got at Target, like desk accessories etc. that would go great.    Well I'm off to think about moving.    Oh shit...  I just noticed, the 5 shelf shelves (redundancy) are no longer available, I should go back to the store and snatch a coupla those bad boys up.  Maybe this weekend.  This would also separate some of my furniture into different months credit card bills.  And stave off my compulsive instant gratification desire.  THE REASONS ARE THREE-FOLD!!!
Tonight I go look at that place I was talking about yesterday.  I hope it's cool.  I have nothing much to say today.  I've been a little nervous, 'cause I want this to work out.  Smoking a lot.  I hope he's normal, and not ugly, but not too attractive.  (Is it weird to have stipulations about how the person you live with looks?  Well I guess not so much weird, but shallow)  I don't know, It's been like 3 years since I've lived with someone I didn't know.  I just hope the age difference doesn't show too much, 'cause I still want to be able to watch cartoons and play video games.  Look at me running off at the mouth when it's not even definite.    Whatever, I need a cigarette...
To begin today, a little update.  Oral-skank still hasn't gotten back to me, but I did get a response from someone else.  Now tell me what you think.  $625 (excellent), all utils including DSL and cable (right on), parking etc.  Sounds too good, well it may be.  He's 32 and his screen name involves the numbers 69.  I'm a little concerned about this.  Maybe he's just juvenile enough to think that that number is funny or something, but didn't we grow out of that in like 6th grade?  Well I mailed him back and asked some questions.  Move-in would be mid-Feb.  And on the map it looks really easy to get to from the east.    Okay on to a new subject.  My sister brought this up last night.  On Jeopardy they just say 'in the form of a question,' and they don't really expound on that, so she was like 'If I got on Jeopardy instead of saying 'What is Jupiter?' I'd say 'Is it Jupiter?''  This went back an forth until we got a little out of hand, here's some possibilities for Jeopardy answers:    Old Way: What is... an American Bulldog? Where is... Milan? Who is... Elizabeth Taylor? What is 'On Top of Old Smokey?' What is... Pizza?    New Way: Did I just run over... an American Bulldog? Do they have whorehouses in... Milan? Does anybody really care about... Elizabeth Taylor? Have you ever had sex... 'On Top of Old Smokey?' Do you throw up from eating too much... Pizza?    See the improvement? I do. Stimu-lator
Today's getting better.  I'm making myself laugh.  Also I went to Wendy's for lunch in memoriam.  When I got in there  Travis  was playing on the sound system.  I was like 'Even from Heaven, Dave Thomas, you have wonderful taste.'  But then the guy charged me 50 cents for some BBQ sause.  Snot-nosed-older-than-me-yet-working-at-Wendy's ASS!    Looking back on today I think I would do things differently to be funny.  D'ya ever do that?  It's kinda annoying, 'cause you're like 'Damnnit, I coulda been funny, but instead I was a sniveling mule.'  This morning when the police officer was waving me over (he was on foot), I should have just looked at him stupidly and waved.  Pretending he was just being cordial.  Now that would've been funny.    And at Wendy's today, when that guy charged me for some topping that probably cost 30 pesetas I shoulda been like 'Dude, show some respect.  Dave Thomas died today.  Now you gotta ask yourself: What would Wendy's founder Dave Thomas Do?'    Ooh, that's a good bumper sticker, WWWFDTD.  Maybe not, it either sounds like a web site for flower delivery, or something you'd find on  Sunday Smackdown .    Well at least I'm feeling a little more up.  Maybe that's because I've decided not to stay late today, maybe not, who the fuck am I kidding, of course that's why.
Today SUCKS!!!    And it's only 9, I can't wait to see what happens later.    1) I forgot my phone so the only way I have music to listen to is if I go outside to get my CDs out of my car.    2) I got a ticket this morning, 44 in a 25 (School Zone).  Fuck that, I swear I was going 35, I was still in 3rd gear.  I'm going to do some internet research into the efficacy of Laser in adverse conditions.    3) I haven't heard back from the Dentist Bitch (I'm sure she's perfectly nice).    4) I may or may not be allergic to some of the skin care products I've been using; I can't stop sneezing.    5) I can't think of number 5.    6) I'm going to Jender's tonight, and without a phone have no way of letting her know what to order from Red Pepper (If you're reading this just pick something that we wrote 'good' next to)    7) Dave Thomas, Wendy's founder and friend to all grease lovers, died.    So Have a Fucking Good Day!  I know I won't.    PS. Hey I think I may have come up with some sort of general idea for a script, but I have to flush it out in order to see if it would make a good flick.  Hey it keeps my hands occupied, otherwise there'd be a party in my pants every hour on the hour.
I am a marketers wet dream.    I saw this little piece in Entertainment Weekly (my bible) about a line of skin care products for men.  So I decided to get some.  I've never really used any, and I'm entering my self-betterment phase of the year, so I bust out the plastic and head for the mall.    The only place I could find them was Saks, and I must say I was not really pleased with their service.  I guess the 2 foot shelf for men's skin care is not really a money maker, but honestly.  I was browsing the shelf for Zihr for like 20 minutes, and not a single querry about how my search was going.  I go to check out and the woman was helping someone else while taking my credit card, so I didn't get to ask any questions.  Meanwhile I was borderline going to buy the shaving gel if I could've gotten a price from her, but nothing, so I said no.    So I get home after dropping a sizable load of cash, and that night I wanted to use the stuff, so I had to shave first (weekends are usually razor free for my lazy ass).  My sister flipped out when she heard the water running so long, she's like 'You're shaving at midnight???'  So I started using.  I bought the undereye cream (I'm such a mo), 'cause I have a genetic predisposition for black bags (and I don't mean Prada).  So I think I have to call one of my lady friends to see how to use this stuff.  I got bottles galore each with it's 10-words-or-less instructions so I'm kinda confused.  And also I'm curious about how long before it kicks in.  I mean if you start using moisturizer is you face instantly gonna stop producing oil, or do you have a coupla days with too much?  I hope I continue to use 'cause if not there's a Benjamin down the toilet.    Also I may have found a suitable place to live.  I gotta see if this 26 yr old Dentist chick responds to my e-mail.  Cross you fingers!
I feel off today.    I was all swervy on the road this morning, but now I'm all in the zone at work.  I'm designing my ass off.  Well not really just improving on some things I half-assed earlier.    So last night I went to Borders to get an oragami one-a-day calendar, but they were out, so I bought a Screenwriting book instead.  It's interesting, I didn't realize how structured the process is.  Now all I need is to come up with an idea.  I hope it comes to me soon.  But until then I should read the whole book before I foray into that process.  The woman at the store was like 'oh, are you a screenwriter?'  and I'm like 'no, I just needed a hobby for this month.'  I fly through things so quickly.  I'd be surprised if I'm still interested in this come The Buffy Season 1 DVD release (Jan 15th, mark your calendars).  But I like to dabble in lots of hobbies, 'cause this way I get to learn a little about a lot of industries.  It makes a well rounded person, or at least a good Trivial Pursuit player.    Well that's about it.  Later
I don't really feel like writing today.  Sorry.  I just don't feel funny, and I hate mediocre entries.  Sue me.    Oh last night I had an awesome dream.  D'ya ever have one of those love dreams.  Like full on chick-flick love.  Complete with sidestories, annoying secondary characters, and melodrama (the gays love their melodrama).  It was awesome.  I didn't want to wake up.  Much more satisfying than a sex dream, I mean I can much more efficiently handle  that  in the waking hours.    Here's to thinking about my dream man.
Shit...    Back at work after a kicking New Year in Manhattan.  I had so much fun.  We went out like every night hang bummed all day.  But not much of it is funny beside the New Years party itself.    Well first off, do you know that there's this channel in NYC that plays  ads for porn?  It's great, but they wouldn't let me watch it.  Girls can be such prudes.  Oh and Friday night I run into an old friend from College at a bar in Union Square, I hadn't seen her in like 2 years.  NY is a lovely yet strange place.    Anywho, So we went out to the  China Club  at arount 8:30 or so.  It opened at 10, and there was no line so we went to a bar across the street for a round.  (meanwhile I had half a dozen beers at Netsie's place)  Get back in line about a half hour before the doors open, and it's FREEZING.  There was a girl in front of us smoking and I thought she looked cold, so I offered to give her one of my gloves.  So we all started talking and her other friends showed up.  One was from Birmingham, and I'm like (in my head) 'Alabama?'  But then he started talking and he was obviously from England.  So he asked us where we were from and I'm like 'Originally, Connecticut.'  Well it turns out he's staying with people from Fairfield, right near my home Trumbull.  So Glove Girl was like 'Do you know Ellen Tollman?'  and I'm like 'Yeah, I touched her breast in 6th grade.' I was off the hook.    So we get in and have a lot of fun drinking and dancing.  All of a sudden I notice that there's nobody on the Stage, so I jump on and start dancing, draging a friend with me.  So a little while after that I'm up on a block on the stage and I lose my balance.  I face-plant on stage.  Bam Bitch went down.  I was craking up so hard    Then a friend of mine wanted to go, so I made sure she knew how to get home and let her go.  Okay not my most chivalrous act, but it was like 12:30 and I wanted to partay!  About an hour or so later another one bites the dust and boots on the floor (and a little on my new shoes I might add).  So Netsie packed her up and headed for the coast.  So we were down to 3.    3 am rolls around and I can't find any of the remainder of our crew.  Finally we hook up and take off.  By this time Times Square (which we had to majorly bypass to get to the club) was now kinda empty making it a straight shot across 47th.  We make a quick stop at McDonalds.  I order a double cheeseburger meal.  When it shows up I get all pissed and am like 'There's only one!  I have two patties and one bun!  What the hell am I supposed to do?'  Well it turns out I really wanted the two cheeseburger meal, so I could share, but I was too gone to think straight.  (I have the same problem with Twin and Double beds, I can never remember which is which)    So the next day I get up at 9:20 and have to walk 12 blocks to meet my sister at my brother's place.  But with some new bruises a strained shoulder and a kicking new limp.
I had a weird dream last night about acid rain and the Looney Toons.  Sylvester's umbrella dissolved and his hair fell out.  But that's all I can remember, maybe I saw it on TV?  Maybe it wasn't a dream at all?  Hrmmm...    It's the little things in life that make you happy.  If I get into work and there's already coffee made I start beaming.  But I always have to feel the pot 'cause sometimes it's just yesterday's afternoon coffee. (that stuff is just raunch)    Still no word from Femme-DDS.  I'm starting to lose confidence.  You've done nothing but study swordplay?  Eeh... More a pursue than a study.  Have you ever considered Piracy?  You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.  Sorry got a little Princess Bride on the brain.    I'm gonna pay my ticket over the phone, I don't think VA transfers points  .  I hope not.  How funny would it be if I had to find a job in the city and couldn't drive my car 'cause I got dropped from insurance.  Well not really funny considering It's hard to find Engineering jobs IN cities.  And then my beautiful baby would become like a hemmorrhaging abscess on my bank account.  (dictionary.com just got like 3 hits for that one)    But all-in-all things are looking up, and settling down, after the money suck that was the holiday season.  Friday I look forward to tons-o-fun at Swank's swanky new pad.      Oh, did anyone catch the Real World Chicago thingy that was on last night.  Well it sucked, but I have a new love.  Chris the gay guy from Mass.  He's lovely.  But a recovering alcoholic, so that wouldn't really work out.  But I look forward to some hot man-on-man action this year.  Hopefully it's not lame like last year.  It's kinda sad that I still watch this.  I'm 22 you'd think I'd have my own life.  Now I have to feed vicariously off 7 losas.  Well maybe this year 6 losas and a hottie.    Off for more Coffee... Annihi-lator
So as the day rises anew I contemplate the efficacy of my rapport with the human species.  Have I lost all propencity for serious thought?  I find myself have trouble going 10 minutes without crackin' wise...  OH MY GOD! Who was that?  It wasn't me.  Well tonight I get to go out.  WOOHOO!!!  I put myself on a $100 stipend this week, 'cause I was running low on cash (realistically I didn't think I could do it).  But tomorrow's pay day and I have $89 buck in the wallet.  Go T$$.  I know all of you are probably like 'thank god.  That dude's been dull since he hasn't been hungover.'  And believe me I'm with you.  I'm only really funny when I'm in incredible discomfort.  But I'm still gonna take it easy tonight.  'Cause I'm still gonna watch a little must-see-tee-vee.  Well that's good.. um... yeah... good times... Well feel free to type a little su'in su'in in the tagboard, it makes me feel loved.
Well I finallly got arount o doing something with this site.  I think it's looking better, but there's always room for improvement, but I'm busy right now, so I can't write any more.    Later Lovers,  yeah you wish...
So I kicked Netflix into high gear.  But today has been boring, I've been staying in all week, and I'm ready to go out, but I'm gonna wait at least until Thursday.  I'm not really feeling particularly funny today, or interesting, or even awake, so I'm gonna keep this really short.  Well I'll catch you guys on the flip side. (it's Wednesday... here's hoping for omelettes tomorrow)
A few things today: I was listening to the radio this morning, and some people are nuts.  On  WHFS  (who I think is trying to get a little edgier) they were at the Grammy's talking to porn stars, and there was either taking pictures of unclothed women or oral sex, I was switching during the commercial.  And, in the spirit of  Grand Theft Auto ,  Elliot  was talking about a game he wants to get backing for, where you're terrorists who take over the Olympics, which I think is a little too out there.  Reguardless of wether or not it's fun, I just think it's too reckless.      However I came up with a game that has edge, and also is less politically offensive.  It's called  Homeless  or maybe  Grifters  but the latter is a little more restrictive.  I'd like it to be a rags to riches adventure where it begins with some simple panhandling/pickpocketing/mugging then progressess to grifting/prostitution/robbery and from there to cock-fights/drug-trafficking/pimping and finally to wetworks/heisting/kidnapping.  And along the way your personal concerns will change as well.  In the beginning your only goal will be securing hootch and rinsing out your only pair of socks, but by the end it will be setting up an offsure bank account in Grand Cayman, and buying a mansion in a non-extradition country.
Well here's another dream, it didn't come last night 'cause I woke up every 10 minutes for some reason, but rather yesterday napping in the noontime sun.  (Check out  White Stripes  -  Fell in Love with a Girl ... That's good punk)    So I had this dream where I went to my distant cousin's house for a funeral.  I was walking around talking to people, and noticing that there was a lot of inappropriate touching between men for calling hours (Is that even what it's called?).  So I'm on my cell with e ('cause that's like all I do lately).  I drop the phone and go to pick it up, but I can't hear anything anymore.  Then I hear a little 'hello-hello' comming from my water glass.  I just kept running up to people laughing and saying 'hey my friend's stuck in this glass.' - 'Say something to this woman Erica.'  Then I realize that both the microphone and the speaker of my phone are rolling around in the glass.  I shut up 'cause I feel stupid now.  Meanwhile back in the funeral of inappropriate fondling, clothes are kinda comming off and I'm perplexed.  I turn to my friend and am like, 'I'm getting the feeling that this is not so much my cousin's house as it is a gay brothel.'  I guess I got the address wrong.  Ooops.    Meanwhile back on earth.  I think I either have a food alergy or a gum inflamation.  I'm not happy with it.
I have seen the face of god, and damn that boy is fine.  No really, I went out last night and I have about 30 nightime don'ts for you.  So after I stupidly forgot to get tickets for the hypnotist and Jender went home I went out a bar (yeah, news to whom?).  I want to appologize to everyone I called last night.  Especially e who got a call at like 3, or as I like to call it 90 minutes into my walk home (hang on I'm getting there).    So I'm out at a bar that's playing the gayest moments in movies, or some such shit.  Like the funeral from  Steel Magnolias  the first performance from  Sister Act  etc.  I see the hottest person in the world (my fucking luck, he was a bartender, Mike... Mark... Milk...  It's not important), so I go talk to him.  Long story short I make friends with 3 really hot guys (him his boyfriend, and a friend from NYC).  At least I got to see two really hot guys kiss.    So they invite me to a club, it was fun, but I'm not sure how frequently I can take that.  This was like the hottest selection of guys I've seen in my life, but shallow like a fox.  I need to work out, 'cause just losing weight makes my skinny, but not hot.  These guys were all shirtless and gorgeous, and meanwhile I'm like 'I've had 5 hours of sleep since thursday, gimme a break.'  (So I pretty much fell asleep 4 times on the dancefloor).  Okay I think were ready for the don'ts, this story got boring.    I think the best part of going out is checking your pockets the next day... It's a veritable who's who of crap.    DON'T: 1. Don't go Out to a club with ppl. you've known for like 30 minutes, even if they're hot, 'cause they don't have your back. (okay like 2 hours is okay) 2. Don't call your friend for confirmation of your prettyness on Saturday, 'cause they ain't home, and they just get really worried and call you later when you have no idea who they are and when sequins came back into style. 3. Don't call them at 9 the next morning either, 'cause they're just mad. 4. Don't go to a club on no sleep, 'cause you ain't looking pretty. 5. Just because you see the Washington Monument does not mean you can walk home. 6. When thinking about walking home, call a cab, it's easy to romanticize but 2 hours later when you have the beer shits from the previous night it's not fun. 6. Don't question black earwax... it's just happens sometimes. 7. When your on an exodus walking home and you come across train tracks, find another way, don't hop the fence and narrowly dodge an approching train. 8. Don't 'balance-beam' on a railing 30 feet above traffic, while tango-ing with an oak. 9. Don't go out when you're still hungover, 'cause the beer shits catch up to you while you're walkin' past the Smithsonian. (worth mentioning twice.)    Okay Peace out. Live it Learn it Love it.     Note: preceding event have been exaggerated for humorous effect, I was really not in danger, even e thinks so.
Yeah, I'm messed up, I just spent the last hour and a half staring at a chicklet,  So much has happened since last we talked.  Well I sent out my tax stuff to my dad (okay lame start, but I'm saving the good stuff for later), and instead of a return address I put:  Jo Babbydaddy He knows Where!  It made me laugh, I'm gonna have to explain ebonics to him though.  So I went out last night.  I think there's a conspiracy against gays in that people are trying to keep us drunk.  'cause when I was straight I never went to bars that had whole nights where beer was free.  I mean how spiteful can you be.  So I was there with Spark and I went to 'buy' the next round.  I find out when I get back that Goodyear asked him if we were up for a threesome.  He's like 'No, sorry.'  But to me he's like I wanted to pull out a little Karen and be like 'Tubby I don't think so.'  Me I was like I wanted to pull out a little Karen and be like: 'Aww, Honey, why don't you head over to Bob's Big Boy and pick up a leg a wing and a biscuit.  There's a threesome, that's more your speed.  HaHaHa, I'm even funny with the rabble...  I'm Chris Rock.'  Spark was cracking up and was like: 'Oh yours was much better.'  He's right you know.    So later that evening, (yeah I missed MK skate, but I'm glad I would have cried) I hit on some boys.  Most of which had boyfriends... or lovehandles.  But this one I was givin' the hungry eye to was cross room flirting.  Nothing became of it, so a few hours later I approached and was like 'I'm doing some market research.  Why didn't you respond to the eye?'  I'm totally not kidding.  I'm such an ASS!  I was T-Ravis-Rashed.  But I gathered some good info on his demo, and got a few nice compliments.  But that sucked... compliments don't play the piper.    So I get home at like 4-5-6.  Honey, I don't remember, I was too tired.  And I wake up at like 10.  All last night I was professing how I was gonna call in sick, but I didn't here I am at work.  So I drive in and I'm all about getting McD's breakfast (hungover happy).  So I pass two Don's in the Disctrict, and make my way to Annap.  I get to the one here at 10:45 and I'm like 'Are you still serving breakfast.'  The guy laughed at me and was like 'No, we stop serving at 10:30.'  I wanted to be like 'Dude, you don't have to laugh, it's 10-freakin-45, it's not like it's 3.'  So I go to pull out and low and behold little Ms. Hunchback with a dog backs into my Sgt. Hughes.  F'that.  I need to get work done now, I'd be rippin' mad if I wasn't so funny.    So I had this excuse all prepared.  'cause everyone else at work uses their kids to get outta stuff (yeah like I buy that Timmy needed to go to the 'doctor').  So I'm all ready to be like: 'Sorry, Janey had a dentist appointment and the little one got an earache, but what are you gonna do?  at that age, you just can't get mad at them.  Even though you just wanna hit them and take away their walking privledges.'  But I didn't have to use it since I got into that accident.    A coupla new things.  My favorite thing to say now when people bring up current events that I'm not familiar with is to say, 'oh I'm sorry, I don't watch straight porn.'  That and I started answering the phone by saying 'Go ahead caller, you're on the air.'  Also, and this is the best one.  I slipped up and said: 'That is so sugar.'  Instead of sweet, I think I'll keep that one.    Pop-u-later
I'm so bored that I'm playing a rubber band rendition of  Mr. Sandman :    Bum-bum-bum-bum, Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream Bum-bum-bum-bum Make him the cutest boy I've ever seen Bum-bum-bum-bum    What time does Michelle skate tonight?  'cause I may wanna go out.  Go Kwan, go Kwan, get funky.  I was talking to Tim, and I'm like wouldn't it be funny if my deal was that I shot people with rubber bands, but right before I struck a pose?  They'd call me  The Rubber Bandit  and my sidekick would be  Paper Clipto .  We would rob from places like Staples and Office Max.  Hehe, I'm insane... no really.
So something in the hall is making noise like a wind up toy.  I'm so tempted to run around the office saying 'Is somebody playing Scategories!!! I want in!'    I think if I win Powerball tonight I'm gonna rent a little old lady to come in to work with me tomorrow and set up and omelette station.  I could go up to everybody and be like: 'Hey have you guys eaten, 'cause Edna here makes a killer omelette.  GET BACK IN THERE BITCH!!! YOU'RE ON THE CLOCK AND WE'VE GOT SOME TAKERS!'  Nothin' says share the happy like an omelette made to order.
I know I just posted an entry, but I needed to get this off my chest before I forgot.  My officemate is just  on  today, he's been making me laugh all morning.  When I told him about my  Daily Grind  idea (which, after a discussion with Jender last night, has incorporated personalized catalog shopping, sound cool?  Send money and I'll get it on it's feet) and he's like 'Ooh, like  The Peach Pit  and   The Peach Pit After Dark .'  Hehe.  but better yet is what just happened.  See, lately I've been havin' a hankerin' for a McD's breakfast (a BEC 'scuit to be exact), and I was talking about how they should delive.  Then I went on to tell him how someone I was talking to live in a place where they had McPizza and they dilivered.  So this is how it went down.  Keep in mind I was trying to say 'Test Market'.  (Look at me, it's like I'm setting up for a blooper.  I'm Dick Clark introducing a Carol Burnette flub)     Me:  So I was talking to someone and they had McPizza in their area, I think they lived in... ah... What's that called?  Tim:  Um... I don't know... The Czech Republic?    I cracked up.  I hope that translated well, but I'm not sure, it was one of those timing thing, Like Jender's 'Haa cha cha!!!'  this weekend.
So did you catch Michelle Kwan's performance last night?  It was pretty good.  I was torn 'cause that was on at the exact same time that the UCONN game was winding down (FYI: they were down by 5 through like the entire 2nd half, they just couldn't protect from the 3's and giving up a lot of boards [geeze you'd almost think I was straight], but somehow things turned around when Michelle was skating, she's done so much for me [okay not too straight]).  I think I OD'd on parentheticals.  I don't know why I like Kwan so much; maybe it's 'cause I think that she's a good role model, a good symbol of America, or maybe it's because she's really my mother.  And a good showing by the other Americans going 3-4.  Woo Hoo.  That stupid Slutskaya ruined the 1-2-3.  I don't trust that girl.  She once gave me a breath mint, and I woke up 4 days later in a onesie in Georgia with a  South of the Border  sticker on my ass.    Damn I'm wierd.  I'm becomming one of those crazys (thats what we call my cousins from West Virginia).  I'm thinking of going to see a hypnotist this weekend.  He was on the radio this morning and it seemed like a lot of fun.  I'd like to participate, 'cause I think that I'm funny anyway, so maybe under the influence, I'd be a laugh riot.  People at work probably think I'm very strange, I'm chair dancing right now to  Basement Jaxx  -  Where's Your Head At , it's funny 'cause it's true.    Last night after watching a very homophobic  Blossom ... erm... I mean  Real World  and a new ep of QAF, I was flicking and put on  Darkwing Duck .  Spark got a weird look on his face, and I'm like; 'That's okay we can put something else on, I'll just watch it in 10 years when nostalgia is in.' HAHAHAHAH!!! I'm cracking up, but not because of that, that was kinda lame, but because of the onesie joke before.
So I'm back on a dream of days past ( see past ).  I've been thinking a lot about winning powerball and opening  The Daily Grind .  But now it's expanded to be a coffee shop/bar/bowling/pool etc.  (ooh, ooh, and maybe it could have like a neon strickthrough and the word Nightly, so at night the name changes)  The best part is I'd sell magazines.  Y'know how it is when you're like: 'Hey let's go get some magazines.'  And your friend is like 'Wicked idea, but where do they sell those?'  Look no further.  But it wouldn't be very successful 'cause I don't like stress, but I wouldn't mind 'cause I'd have my PB winnings.  God, why can't  I  have a failing business.  I'd also have  Trivial Pursuit  cards all around, 'cause I was at a place where they did and I thought it was cool.  What else, oh yeah, boxed wooden matched only.  Can't you picture it?  I'd call you up and say 'Come on down to  The Daily Grind ,' I'd say, 'It's half price  Corona  and  CondÃ© Nast .'    Gotta go; I just choked on my own spit, damn I'm a moron.
Good Morning, Good Morning, we've talked the whole night through, good morning good morning to you.    Not to me, I'm beat.  I got in late, but it's president's day, and I for one think that nobody should be working, let alone me.  My excuse was that since schools are out I had to find an appropriate day care for my kids.  Like I'd ever have kids.  I dried my sweater way too much.  It's tight.  Even for me.  I guess people at work will just think I'm even stranger.  I guess it doesn't help that my jeans have big cuffs at the bottom 'cause I have to wear them low to accomadate the tattoo.  Hey when it's all better I'll put a nice picture up of it.  It's zzzexy.    I'm so pathetic, just looking at those z's made me tired.
So it's sunday night and I'm trying to decide what position I will play in this new society that I have become a member of.  I have to get past my shyness, but I fear that I may go too far.  I don't want to become the slut, or do I?  It's also a valid position, but I'm not sure what's for me.  I've realized that I'm young, and hot, and pretty much, I can decide what I want.    Is it lots of sex with people I don't know, or is it something more?    I don't know
I had a dream that I came home and there were a dozen boxes of  Harry and David  pears on my doorstep.  Why am I subconsciously getting fruit delivered?  Maybe it's 'cause my mom hasn't ordered me any  Omaha Steaks  in a while.  I'm such a spoiled brat.    Okay so last year my brother got me these  Deisel  jeans and they're awsome, but I was fat then, and they're about 3 inches too big in the waist.  So now I look at myself in the mirror, and even though I'm swimming in these puppies I look fat.  But I'm done losing weight, and I can't aford to get another pair.  So here's my idea.  Do you think I can call my mom and ask if she'll pay for it?  I mean it's for my health.  Maybe not.    I was listening to the radio this morning and they were talking about fights at supermarkets. This pharmacist said that some guy came in with a forged prescription and he refused to fill it.  A few minutes later he was beaned by a can of  Ensure  I had to laugh, I can just picture it: 'To your health Fucker!' (Whooosh - Boink!) Hehe.
Happy freakin' Valentine's Day to all you.  Every year I think I should be all depressed on this day, but for some reason I'm not.  I mean I've never really had anyone on this day, so I guess I don't know what I'm missing.  I guess when it comes down to it, I'm gonna get depressed about not only this day, but the other 364 as well.  I guess it doesn't help that my hair is looking a little...  well lets not get into that... I think I have to go see a doctor about a certain... shit I don't wanna talk about it.  It's not like it's getting bad, but I've just talked to a few people who are like 'nip it in the bud.'  I mean my bro has had his share of difficulty with it, and he always warns me, not to mention my trick this weekend said something about early action.  (yeah like that wasn't embarrassing)    This is fucking great, now I'm in a spectacular mood.  Why'd you have to bring this shit up.  Thanks a lot!    On another note, I think I am done dieting.  I looked at myself in the mirror and I'm like: 'hey, you're skinny.'  And not just straight skinny, that's easy, but gay skinny.  So I can eat what I want now.  I think I'm still gonna stick to diet coke (damn Freud will not let me type that word cleanly) 'cause I don't wanna rebound.    Okay I'm in a better mood.  And hey you gotta be happy when you only have one day left of your moneyless week.    Hey check out  Phantom Planet  -  California  it's really good
How 'come cartoon pigs all have stutters?  Porky, Piglet, I'm sure there have been others.  What is it about the pig that we find it is necessary to impede their speach.  Is it 'cause they are so cute in drawn form we must even the score so the other barnyard animals don't get jealous?  It was just a general wondering-ment I was having.    Geeze I'm ready to go home.  I'm so tired.  If you were to ask me to pick up a brick right now I'd say: 'Fuck no, pick it up your own damn self.'  Did I mention I was cranky too.
Damn it's hump day.  I was listening to the raadio today and they were talking about this event they're having comming up called Kegs and Eggs.  It's a party from 8am-noon.  It sounds like a lot of fun, but it's on a friday.  It seems kinda messed up to take a whole day off just for a four hour party.  And it seems like the think that you may stumble home from not walk.  But Carbon Leaf is playing.  I'll think about it, it's a month from friday (2 days prior to Jender's Birthday).    On another note I just ran out of money (I mean until friday).  I kinda flipped out yesterday about it.  Then I realized I have another check before next rent.  It's just with these alimony payments now, I have to rebudget.  Yeah I know that's a lie, but I thought it was better than I spent $300 on a blanket and a pillow.  Sometimes I just have to give myself a knowing look and say: 'Where's your head at?'
So I've been watching the Olympics a lot.  I love it. But last night was heartbreaking.  What happened during the pairs free-skate (long program).  It was Canada hands down.  The the Canadians were like 'This is horseshit... you call this a sport... We skated our asses off.'  Oh wait that was DB Sweeny.      Then I caught the end of the US men's curling match against Canada.  Not pretty.  We conceeded at 9-3 in the 9th.    But I guess I couldn't be too upset with the men's halfpipe sweep by Americans.  That was awesome.  Single-handedly put us back in the medal run lead with Germany.  I love that shit.  I almost cried when I saw all three American flags going up.  It gets me.  Kinda like that commercial with the guy who takes a picture of himself sleeping and writes 'wish I was here xx,' on it.  It melts me.
So I'm thinking of getting another tatoo.  Well I've wanted one for a while, but here's my reasoning.  I want to get it on my tummy.  For one I think it's sexy, but also I think it may deter me from getting fat, 'cause I wouldn't want to stretch it.  It would also detract from my less than washboard abs (or maybe it'd accent them, who knows).  So what do you think?  I'm not sure if they'd let me since my navel is pierced, maybe it's like a cart before the horse sorta thing.  But I don't know what I'd get.  The first one I had planned for a while, so I knew what I wanted, but this one, I'm not sure.  If you have any suggestions  urlLink guestbook  me.  I know I don't want any living things like dragons or lizards (I don't do that tounge thing...) nor birds of prey.  Plants?  ehhh... I think I like designs.  Well if I get bored today I'll doodle.    Pinches for all-
I'm officially the stupidest person in America.    I was doing laundry today while talking to e.  I get back to my place and realize that I locked myself out.  Okay lets set the stage.  I did a little drinking last night (and got a little lucky too) so today I have those pesky beer shits.  So I'm locked outta my apartment with no shoes, and none of the maintnance people are home... 'cause I'm that unlucky.  But what I could do was finish my laundry (read silver lining).  Wait I can't finish this right now I need to shower I still have sex on me.    Okay clean as a whistle.  And one of my neighbors was singing really loudly.  I took that time (I was given the gift of time) to catch up on my correspondence (there wer too many  Friends  quotes in there).  So then singer/songwriter with a clay mask came out and tried to help me locate someone to let me in.  Finally I had e scratch up my roomate's cell.  So I give him a call.  He's in Baltimore.  An hour later I realize I have my emergency plastic key and I can go get cigarrettes outta my car.  I go down into the grage closing the (locked) door behind me effectivly trapping me in the garage.  Luckily when I finished the cigarrette my roomate drove in.  I was soo happy.  He was carrying a big box so he threw me the keys, and as a good gay man I missed them.  They hit my square in the right nut.  A perferct end to a perfect day.
I am officially - borderline - alcoholic.  I woke up this morning at 7 on my bathroom floor covered in vom and with heavy boxers.  I've never shat myself before, I guess there's a first time for everything.  I'm so embarassed.  That's why I'm telling all you's guy's.  I have to go shopping for our party soon.  See this is the shit that happens when I hang out with my brother.  I'm just glad I wasn't in bed, 'cause I have expensive sheets.    I think I danced with Annie last night.  You know the little orphan.  Dog by the name of Sandy.  She's okay, but really cheap.  She claims she's had a 'hard knock life' and I'm like take a number sister, I just crapped myself.
CAN YOU FEEL THAT? AW SHIT OOOH-AH-AH-AH-AH!    It's friday.  And if anyone can't tell I have DSL.  It's like I've been freed from a 4 year prison of slow transfers and drop offs.  I don't even know when I went to bed I was having fun looking for... um music... yeah.  If you wanna talk to me I'll be on IM a lot more.  I'll still be away all day at work, but at nights.  It's the kick I d/l'd like 8 songs before work today, including Disturbed's  Down with the Sickness  (which explains the intro).    I think my brother is comming to town today.  Which means one thing.  Wasted friday.  I gotta find out soon what we're gonna do 'cause we have that party tomorrow night.    Do you know what today is?  It's day one of the 19th Winter Olympic Games.  I'm so psyched, but the only thing on today is ski jumping.  Well everyone enjoy their day I know I will.  And here's a little playlist to think of:     Carbon Leaf  -  American Tale   Disturbed  -  Down with the Sickness   Hoobastank  -  Crawling in the Dark   Social Distortion  -  Ball and Chain   Jimmy Eat World  -  In the Middle   Remy Zero  -  Save Me   Phantom Planet  -  California
Sometimes I'm not the brightest bulb on the chandelier.  I'm trying to hook in to pre-existing DSL connection, and I'm not to sure about the things I'm gonna need.  I hate networks.  I don't know if it's me, but I'm not sure if my deoderant is working.  I think a certain Old Spice is gonna have to buy a certain someone a stick of his old stuff.    Tuesday when I was out, I was playing pool.  I had a few drinks so I was shooting really poorly.  I actually used the phrase 'well, at least I'm pretty.'  I think it shows a lot fo personal growth.  I hope I'm getting past my poor self-image thing.  I mean listeng to someone's self-mutilating banter is about as fun as listening to two bluejays at a Melissa Etheridge concert.    So I guess I'm off to drop a few bills this afternoon too.  Shit, but as I always say: 'You gotta spend money to watch porn.'
Someone just googled to me by searching for: 'Communism in North America.'  Boy were they dissapointed.  Well I'm just assuming, 'cause I didn't actually talk to them.    I've been thinking lately about people that were once in my life that I lost touch with.  One in particular.  She was my best friend from like 2nd grade 'till 8th grade.  I haven't talked to her in like 5 years.  Whenever I run into people from THX I ask them about her, but I never seem to run into her.  I guess part of me just kinda misses her.  I mean this is the girl with whom I organized apple sauce straw races in elementary school.  (Which is how I still eat the stuff, and where I got my fondness for sucking stuff.  Sorry, that was both disturbing and ill-timed)    Well I guess I'll never talk to her, but maybe next year at our 5 year.  Damn I need a date.  Oh, but you don't really show up to 5 yr's with a date, that's more of a 10 yr sorta thing.  I'm kinda curious to see who else from highschool is a rough rider.  I've only heard about like 3 people comming out.
I just read my horoscope today and it said:  'Don't even think about working today, you have no focus.'  And man is it right.  I'm psyched I have an out now.  If they ask me to do something I'll just be like.  'Sorry can't, I got orders.'      Whack! Smack! what was that? Darkwing Duck is on the attack. This is where you'll find him at. Fighting crime like a maniac.    Does anybody else remember that commercial?  My friend Tine and I in 8th grade had a little dance to that, it involved slapping, jumping, and some tush flailing.  We'd do it in school all the time.  FLAME OUT!
I'm back.  Unfortunately.  I got my mattress yesterday and it rocks my boxers.  If any of you reading this are cute boys feel free to come over and check it out.  I went out to a bar around the corner last night with Spark.  After Buffy, he's like do you wanna check out neighborhood bars, and who am I to pass it up?  It was kinda fun, but kinda dead 'cause it was Tuesday and everything.    2 days 'til Olympic Fever!!!  It's a disease, I'm gonna print out a pretty schedule when I'm through with you brats.  Oh shit I think I found a lump in my luging ankle, the Olympic Fibrosis is already starting, stage two is Curler's Wrist, then the dreaded sequining of my clothes to be like Kwan.  I may just go get the bedazzler to make it easier.    BE LIKE KWAN!!! BE LIKE KWAN!!!
I just got my delayed hangover, I almost booted in the bathroom before.  This sucks, I don't understand, I was doing so well this morning, wakin' up on time etc.  Damn!  It's like a Kevin Costner movie, you wait so long for it to come, and when it finally does you're pissed that you were born.    (I gotta give a shout out to my coworker for that one.  I came up with the analogy, but I was constipated on who would be a good actor to name so I asked Tim)    I think it's the six pack of Amstel and 4-5 glasses of red trying to tell me something.
I forgot to mention, I think the funniest one liner last night was made by Pawn.    The Bud Light commercial was on where the girl was preparing the room for sex.  And she's shouting down to her husband that there's candles and satin sheets and finally Bud Light then he runs up while stripping and dives on the bed but slips out the window.  So we're all laughing 'cause it's pretty funny and Pawn was like 'It's funny 'cause it's true.'  I couldn't take it.    My best showing was probably in the car when we were talking about the show I dunno I think it's called Elimidate.  So Pawn was explaining the rules and he's like 'so there's like a guy and 5 girls...'  and I'm like 'oh, I've had that nightmare.'  Timing was perfect.    Well I gotta go now.
I am sated.    It only took me like 35 mins to get in today.  WOOHOO!!  And it only gets better, 'cause I had to walk to my car this morning.  But that in and of itself was great.  I live in a city now, and walking around at 8 in the morning people are everywhere.  It's wonderful.    I had a blast yesterday.  I went with my new roomate Spark to his friends' place.  It was just cool hanging with other gay dudes.  I was cracking up the whole time, they were really funny, and I was on as well.  Not to mention that the superty-bowl was awesome.  And the couple whos house it was loved football.  Which I found cool, I like well rounded asses... I mean homos.  Every time someone would come on screen we would shout out 'hey look it's...' and then put some weird name in.  Which was really funny drunk.  The Rams coach was called everything from Wilfred Brimley to Dame Judi Dench to Marky Post to Rerun.  Add in some 'tight-end' humor and drooling over Tom Brady, it was a laugh riot.    We were talking about valentines day and if Spark should get his boy of 2 months a gift.  Pawn suggested that it not be too relationshippy.  I started cracking up 'cause I'm like 'you should get him the pro-trim, and you can be like I saw how your eyes lit up when we watched that commercial.'    Well all in all I am happy about the move.  I think I'm gonna go get my computer today and my mattress comes tomorrow.
Happy friday!    I'm happy, and also in possession of certain keys to a certain apartment.  Woohoo!  Now I can go anytime I want, it's like I live there already... wait I paid rent, so I do live there.  Took some measurements last night, and it looks like the bed frame I want is OUT.  I'm upset, but I'll get over it.  I'm probably gonna have to do the bed in a corner thing to get the desk in there, and my sister was like 'You don't want to close it off any more with a footboard, it'll make it look even smaller.'  Fuck her for being right.  But it does save me like 4 large (is large thousand or hundred? I think it's thou, but I mean hun).  So now when I get board today at work I'm gonna cut out little shape for furniture and play puzzle with graph paper, or possibly go to target to look for plastic (I want to make this shower curtain out of 4'x8' plastic rounded rectangles that are connected with loops.  I'm thinking green with a strip of blue at the top, and one second from the bottom.  all in all it comes out to 8 rows of 18 columns.  It's like 144 pieces and 414 connections.  But I think it'll look kick-ass.  I think I'm gonna have to cut up folders or something, it's impossible to find sheets of plastic.).  Well be in good spirits, and have a blessed weekend. psha!
This week has been insane at work.  It the end of year for us on Friday and I need to get all this stuff done.  But I still steal a minute or two to move over some more old posts.  If you notice to your left there are some posts archived by month.  Have fun.  Other than that.  Did you catch 24 last night.  I was IMing with some guy so I wasn't giving it my undivided attention, but it was good.  Well I hope that these posts pick up.  Where'd the funny go?  I guess beat out of me by work.  But Crew Class starts Monday, so that's cool.  I hope it's fun, and helps me keep in shape.  Late
Hello all, I've been itching to get back into the Blog thing for a while.  It's been a 2 year vacation....  We'll get into that shit over the comming weeks.  I guess I should introduce me.  I'm a 24 yr. old gay guy in DC from New England.  I've been here for just under 3 years.  I love it and think I've found home.  So I'm thinking about moving all my old Diaryland posts over, but that's gonna take a while.  Some day maybe you can check them out.  (I was thinking about neglecting to move the self-important, or self-loathing, or otherwise embarrasing posts, but that's not real)  Also the template is under construction, and I don't really know my Blogger shit so it's gonna be handicapped for a while until I get into the swing, so bear with me.  Enjoy!
Awesome, it's a four day week, then a four day weekend, then another four day week.  Wahoo!  I can't even think about working right now.  Blah blah, I'm so not into it.  I was laying in bed last night and I couldn't fall asleep, I thought these damned cicadas were only suppoesd to make noise during the day.  I guess that was a false.  Well I gotta get back to work.
I was on the Connecticut Post's site, wondering about the recognition of Massachusettes' marriages in my home state.  The I came across the message board.  I was so angered by everybody's use of 'god' in defining civil law that I needed to respond.  This is what I said;   Let's not stop at denying same-sex couples the right to marry. Let's deny all people the right to marry under the law. If marriage is such a time honored religious institution then the government (state or federal) has no place to recognize it. Let's establish civil unions, blind to race, gender, etc. to establish stability in household and the rights and privileges guaranteed to present day married couples. Then the church can have its marriage; thus averting the apocalypse that so many people have been referring to. And the religious right can continue along its morally superior, discriminatory, path to save us all. Religion has no place dictating the lives and lawful actions of those in a society founded on the principle of religious freedom. That it is already ingrained in our everyday lives is not a sound argument for perpetuating it's presence. The only purpose it serves is to alienate those who do not believe in the Judeo-Christian establishment, thus infringing on their religious freedom. Government should be secularized and god should be removed from the public sphere.
Hey guys.  I have had this  urlLink song  in my head for a few weeks.  listen and enjoy.  Things have been going cool here for a bit.  I finished my rowing class and met a lot of cool people.  I start for real in June.  Um, I'm almost finished transfering all my old posts.  only 100 left.
So I get my LSAT scores back next week, and I've been all over this forum where people are talking about admissions etc. and mainly the LSAT.  On the site people have been recounting their testing experience and trying to remember any question they can.  Through this I think I have built a false hope that my score is good, since I always seem to get the answer ppl on the forum think is correct.  Which is cool, but now I'm nervous.  To top it off (and not in the good way) I have heard from numerous sources that they hod gotten their scores early.  This kinda frightens me since I was prepared for them showing up on the 6th.  Oh well, we'll see. Cross your fingers and hope for Travey.
I'm finally home, well at work.  After a grueling weekend.  I'll lay it down for you.  Firday I do (almost) a full day of work.  And get a ride to the airport at about 8 (car).  This I hop on my 35 minute flight to Newark (plane; yeah I know, it was dumb, but flyi.com doesn't start flying to JFK till next month or something).  After taxiing and everything it took about 2 hours.  Then I hop on a shuttle to Grand Central Station (bus), the Jersey transit system , in their infinite wisdom, decided that only one lane was required for entrance into New York City.  So my 35 minute bus ride took 2 hours.  I get to the train station and look for the next train, well this was convenient, there was only one left.  I had missed the 11:22, and the 12:22 so it's the 1:30 for me.  I don't know if any of you have taken the 1:30 outta GCT, but unless you're intoxicated it's not fun.  It's like the drunk tank at county (does anyone know what county is?  Just sounded like somthing Perry Mason would say, or better yet, Matlock).  To top this off there was a Phish concert in NYC.  And if you know anything about me, you know I don't like Phish.  So me on a train with a bunch of drunk and high kids.  To top it off, the 1:30 makes EVERY stop through to Connecticut, so my 45 minute ride (train) took 2 hours.  Finally I roll into Trumbull at 3:30 and get to sleep.... 'till 9.  Saturday was nice, the wedding was pretty and stuff.  I really wasn't feeling the Catholic sercive, although who does. 'Honor' this, and 'serve' that, and 'make him a cheese sammich woman.'  The reception was cool, very Italian, but I ended up making friends with a cousin of mine that I haven't seen in like 8 to 10 years.  She's cool.  Danced like a fucking freak, caught holy hell for that the rest of the weekend.  But 'sall good, when the three of us (Todd, Traci and I) get together it's in good fun.  Went to bed at like 2... 'till 6.  Sunday was really cool.  Went to the U.S. Open, not really a golf fan, but the weather was incredible and it's just overall a cool experience.  Kinda bummed that Phil doubled the 17th, but ehh... there was some good golf played.  This is a conversation I had with my brother's fiancewhile whatching some guys put on the 16th green.  Meg: Where's the hole? Trav: Megan you gotta remember these thing, jeeze. Meg: Do you know where the hole is? Trav: I got a couple ideas.  We got outta there at like 7:45, crammed 4 people in the back of my sister's Pathfinder.  And started a horrible trip through long island.  4 hours later (and about 50 miles), we roll into Manhattan and drop off Todd and Megan.  Then we trade off and each drive a bit.  My shift came on at 1:30 and was the last leg.  I was so tired, being in the sun all day and all.  Finally roll in at about 3:30.  All in all, horrible trip, but some perspective; it still was shorter than my trip up there... and I flew.
Felling Good   Nina Simone   Birds flyin' high you know how I feel Sun in the sky you know how I feel Breeze driftin' on by you know how I feel Its a new dawn, its a new day, its a new life for me yeah, its a new dawn its a new day its a new life for me ooooooooh AND I'M FEELING GOOD  Fish in the sea, you know how I feel River runnin' free you know how I feel Blossom on the tree you know how I feel Its a new dawn, its a new day, its a new life for me And I'm feelin good  Dragonfly out in the sun you know what i mean dont you know Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean Sleep in peace when day is done that's what I mean And this old world is a new world and a bold world for me  Stars when you shine you know how I feel Scent of the pine you know how I feel Yeah, Freedom is mine, and I know how I feel Its a new dawn, its a new day, its a new life for me (Free styling) OH I'M FEELING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD.
I took the LSAT monday.  The culmanation of a 2 week blitz study session.  I don't want to go out on a limb and predict my score, but I think that I'll be at least comfortable with it.  The testing environment was much better then Oct. '02 when I last took it.  This time I think I'm ready to make the plunge, hopefully I can get in to the schools I want though.  But I have 3 weeks to obsess about how I did, and you know me.  I've already established a Y! group to try to compile everyone's memory of the exam so we can see if we got questions correct.  So far I've gotten most of them right, but I'm not sure about this one about 'Health Education' and Propaganda.  Anywho, that's all I got to say about that.  On another note I've been talking with this really kick guy on IM (but he know's about this site, so I won't go into detail about this...  if you want the skinny you can contact me ;) ).  Also I've been really blah at work, an I'm going to Connecticut this weekend.  I'm really hoping to slow down for a bit next week.
So I was sitting on the john the other day and it was all rocking back and forth.  A few months ago the landlord changed our toliet 'cause it was leaking and causing problems int he apartment below.  Since then it has been a little less than stable.  So while I was using the facilities the other day I reached into my '5th' pocket on my jeans and pulled out a nickel and a penny.  I was able to shim the nickel in the from and the penny in the back.  Now it doesn't rock anymore.  Also I got my LSAT scores last week.  99th percentile... not bad.  Also, 6 days until I go on vacay to San Fran, I'm wicked excited.  PS.  I hope all y'all e-mailed your Senators this week.  I've been watching C-Span all week on the FMA debate.  Later
So I found this site in a gay magazine.  urlLink ratemyschlong.com  I love it... added to the fact that there's some NICE dick on it. It's a great waste of time. I posted one of me... heheh... but it's pending.  My friend from CMU is comming to visit today. I'm psyched 'cause I haven't seen him on about 3 years and I've never seen him gay. Well I guess he was always gay, but I didn't know until last year. Oh yeah and he's super cute, but that's besides the point. I hope we have a lot of fun.  well have a blast on RMS, it's hella-addictive
Master Seaworld(Pictured above with willy)is the town hero and if anyone thinks different then prove it. And the town hero needs a fanclub so...this is it boys and girls.   ~~~~MEMBERS OF THIS FANCLUB~~~~~~~(SO FAR) 1. DANIELLEâº 2. CAITLIN 3. John Reed 4. Wilson! 5. Jen   6. Jonathanâ£
Until i can figure out how to put my pics up this website is well dead. but i wanna give a halla out to every one, have a good spring break.
After complicated research and many nights awake so many questions trying to figure out just where exactly did 'Crotch Goblins' come from...but I finally figured it out.       Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey... Of course! How could I be so blind for sooo long. Its obvise. We must put an end to this terrible creature. But how do we do it... that is a good question mate...But      Jessica being so fucking retarded  we can just lower her in by giving treats and lead her to a bear trap and WHAM chop her head off.         Now nick being the intelligent one of bunch we presade him by telling that John Reed is in his bedroom, Nick will be very excited  then run to his bedroom and then we take a gun and shoot him when he enters.     We the people are the only possible source with the technology to stop this awesomly bad things... Join me my friend into elimating these critters. Thank you for your time for this imformation. Thank you and good bye
ONCE APON A TIME----THERE once was a very angery kid named JOhn Reed. JOhn was always angery about the dumbest stuff. one day he disobeyed his parents and turned on the t.v.(john wasnt alowed to watch t.v b/c it made him even madder.)so he turned the t.v to station 8. POKeMON was on. John got soo mad at the charaters,plots, and pokemon. he got so mad that he got up and got this dads golden gun and went down stairs and then he got so mad that his special ablity, transportation, came upon him. he was then transported to the world of pokemon. creepy. so he went around the 'crazy forest' and short wild pokemon. SO then 3 days latter,john, was getting pretty fed up of eating pokemon so he went out of the forest and desided to find Ash(the star of the t.v series) he found him playing with pikahu on a park bench in the city. he walk up to ASH with the gun. ASH, who had never seen a gun or gold before in his life. Ash asked him if was a fancy mustard holder. John(of course)said,'yeah, of course it is u loser'. so Ash being very hungery took the golden and stuck it in this mouth and shot it. Ash died with a smile on his face-because of his love for mustard.ummm.mustard. so then pikahu sat here laughing-cuz he had always hated ask but just never expressed it. for pikahu was a weed/heroin dealer-and had been slipping ASH huge amounts of cystal-meth ever since they had met. but Ash had become amune to it so it had no effect. so then pikahu said in a deep,big voice-said,'lets get outta here and have the time of our life!'. so john transported him and pikahu out of the t.v in time for dinner. FROM then on john kept pikahu in his closet and made him be his slave rat for the rest of his pokemon life(which is forever)(unless shot.) AT age 101 John was on his deathbed with pikahu chaned to this side(pikahu was cleaning the bedpans)(of course) with the last bit of effort John took out the golden-gun and told pikahu,'i am taken u with me,haha'.Pikahu said'o cccrap..iii' Bang they both died at the same time but he dint even use a bullet. thats because in the door why, stood the secert agent-MR.Linscott!but he had only used one bullet!and they both had been shot. and the romm was like john on bed-picahu on light stand-next to the bed and mr.s standing infront of them both.! the end.STORY OVER KIDDIES!(TALKING BEGINS AND HANDS RAISE) -----------------------------------------------------------------     **John Reed-{raises his had and says},'Mr.LINSCOTT that makes no cents-it would have been impossable.Stop using my name in every story, its getting so old.   **MR.LINSCOTT-{leans back in chair and smiles at john in a gay shorta way)Sweety,IT makes total  cents are u blinded.IT in my NEW book i just wrote, so it must be true'.{wink};)       **JohnReed-Nasty,No my door doesnt go that way.The story it just makes no cents{leans back in chair and begins playing tetris again.       ****DitzyBlondeGirL-tell us another story.How about the tiger story!!!!!please,please. awww come on.    **Danielle-not again, its so fake-make it stop.       **Caitlin-he is such a major crotch goblin.      **Mr.LInscott-have i told u the one about the pokemon.

Danielle wanted me 2 make up a story so here it is...       Once upon a time there was a place without guns...Now this place still wasn't all that peaceful, for the replacement of guns they used sticks instead. Anyways there was very few critters in this mysterious land without guns. This story takes place with a couple crittters named Master Seaworld and Myran. Both were not very bright..but together they equal one brain.  Walking miles though out the dessert Master Seaworld finally reached his destination of his life time... the golden Porta Pot... it was times like these Master Seaworld Charased these moments... So when he got there he took a dump and then left with satisfaction.     When he got back tired and ready for sleepies when he entered his room he found his buddy Myran... ready for action. Master Seaworld being a reasonable man... said 'not today Myran, I'm excectionally tired and want rest'. So Myran got mad and ran away... but came back an hour or two later. MAster Seaworld was still exsosted from his trip... but that didn't stop Myran... he ran up and jumped on his bed screaming 'I want Pan Cakes' Finally master S got up and made pan cakes and slept on the couch while watching he favoritist show ever! Franklin the Turtle on Nick Jr. All of sudden outtda now where Myran ran up with a stick in his sweaty palm and started beating Master S 2 death! So Master S finally died. Everybody was very sad...                THE END Stay tuned for the Series Coming Soon ;) I love D.J :)

These girls we called 'the hillbilles' wanted to know what we wrote on the signs. We gave them a sign. They ran home and told there mom we called them ghetto. So there mom came and yelled at us saying we can't call people ghetto, so we stoped and some day we will try to make a ghetto again!

There once was a baby named Bo Jangles. When he was born his parents were told that he was blind, but Bo wasn't blind. The doctors were foreign, and they believed that he was blind because of this really light colored eyes. While growing up he tryed to convince his parents that he wasnt blind, but they would never listen. So he started to pretend he was blind. The only person that believed him was a kid named JohnReed. Both of their fathers were highly involved in the  MOb.(organized crime) While JOhn's dad was the boss. Bo's dad was the right hand man. So there familys were really good friends.(Like family) One day JOhn was making fun of Bo's blindness by throwing a apple at Bo at a mob meeting. BO,not being blind,caught it.Then john asked bo what color his hair was. Bo was like brown 'freak'. John realized how cool Bo was and they became best friends.  They were kinda stupid.Yeah so they got like lost a whole bunch. So one day Bo Jangles and JohnReed were on there way to the gas station to pick up some tacos. They desided to take a short cut throw the corn field. And geuss what??? they got lost. so they started going throw the corn rows when all of a sudden they spoted a sign. It read dont mess with the crotch-goblins. John Reed siad,'Caitlin Kyle,this girl @ school is always talking about those things.' AlL of a sudden a C-GOB bounced on BO Jangles head and hiss at him. Bo, took the C-GOB and took it off his head and took a bite out of it. 'Taste like some sorta weirdness'. 'I dont think u should have ate that,stupid',said JohnRxxd.'I dont care', Bo said. All of a sudden there was a nosie coming from the corn rows. 'WHAT DID U DO TO MY C-GOB!!' It WAS CAITLIN!! 'Hey caitlin!',said John. Hey john. n/m Which one of u ate the c-gob. did u realize that was the last one left? bO SIAD,'SOrry i didnt realize it.' caitlin runs over to bO and beats him up. Caitlin then realizing that it didnt really matter ask them why they are in the midddle of a corn field. John answers,' we were on a qwest for tacos but we got really lost!!'.'I can i join i think i could help.?',saids caitlin. They answer yes and continue on there mission.Day turned to night and they began to get tierd. THey could barely see anything when they walked rightt into a man. The man was really tall. Bo took out this keyring flashlight and tapped on this back. the man turned around. It was BoB the janitor.WHat the heck?'Mr. bob .What are u doing in the corn field. Very simple,Mr.reed.I am Jeepers Creepers. I am inside of bob, u know using his body!!! 'Really',said Bo. 'Since U have found out my secert i will send u one person to help u'. The 3 kids huddle togther to think of a person. We want       .'O wAIT i ONLY NOW one person. i only have one friend. i meet this girl playing on-line bingo a while ago. i told her i had no friends and she told me that she would be my friend,. i WILL SEND HER to u!'Thanks' they siad. All of A SUDDEN a girl appears and jeepers creepers flys away. 'It cant be,Danielle?',says john. 'Aww, one mintue i am in bed the next in this corn field.'You all have some explaining to do'. THEY expalined all to danielle. 'So i geuss i am stuck with u guys', saids danielle.I geuss its not all that bad.  They continued. After a while they all got disscouraged and begun to believe they were lost 4ever. But while walking through the corn field caitlin tripped over a bar typed object, it was a water spicket. they all took a drink . and then all went to sleep. the next day when they woke up, they figured out that the wtare had been magical! tHey all had turned mult-colored. iT was so weird. bUT the effect wasnt perment. thanx goodness. They continued on there qwest. they found a small shack. they all could barely fit into it. it was filled with cotton candy. There was a little boy inside, he had big bug eyes and he also had lazyeyes. so one eye was on the cotton and the other on the unexpected geust. The boy said in a small voice,' yOU WILL FOREVER re-main in this house for life.' All of a sudden The doors and windows dissappeared into nothing and they all; look at each other in puzzlement'. 'What are we going to do?'said bo. I do know?? 'I know i am eating some of this great candy',said danielle. good idea. they all sit and eat the candy. The boy then explains how he got lost one day and found the house and has been stuck in there for the last 12 years. 'wow' 'that is amazing' 'i guess we will be here 4ever then.' yeah. at least we arnt alone. yeah. 'are parents are going to be freaked'. It will be okay i think. 'I love cotton candy'..,saids danielle. 'yeah',they all said'. 4the next 100 years they ate  cotton candy and played 20 qwuestions. but they did in the end go insane and become addiccted to bark.
oK SO TODAY FOR 3 HOURS. i was biking.(summer gym). so we(me and terra) are riding back from butler. so this kid behind us like savurs and goes in to the woods and crashes. we both look back and then like crash into each other. but we stop and are like'u ok kid', and'u need bandaids'. he siad he was ok, but he was lieing. anyone falls into a forest/ditch isnt ok. metally or phyically. i hope he didnt like pas out and is still laying in the woods. that would be bad. so far i have seen 3 bike crashes.so therefor biking is the unseen danger.  p.s-i added new tag ons to the website-scoll down-!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A LONG time ago. Like 2 days ago. There was this guy named johnreed. johnreed he was a character. hE WAS walking outside at 4:30 in the morning on MARION ave. which is a never-ending road! Well he was walking along the road when all of a sudden a guy in a pink and blue tractor-trailer pulled up beside him and blew a dart of poison into this neck. The man got out of his car and pulled john into the car and took him home. JOhn woke up 13 hours later with a horrible headache. The first thing he saw was the figure of a man wearing a purple suit.â who are you', john still dizzy asked. 'My name,MR. Rxxd, is Sam Kingostopper'. 'But U can call me Kingo, all my closest friends doo'!.John says, now getting jumpy, 'What am doing here'!!!!!! 'This has to be some shorta joke!' 'Where am I'? KINGO replys,'u are in the ghetto.' 'There are no ghettos'!,  JOHN REPLYS. 'That is a ignorant thing to say foolâ, said KINGO. 'Stop playin word games with meee!'Says john. 'IM NOT PLAYIN WORD GAMES WITH YOU'. All of a sudden kingo forces john to lick a poisoness frog. john passes out and hits the floor.Kingo goes back to playing with his pet lobster, named bunny. john wakes up a day later, remmbering what had happened.O CRAPz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'MR. jOHNrEEd u have finally woken up, u had a very long and pleasent nappy-sleppy-sleppy.' john said,' cut to the case, why am i here.' 'its very simple,mr.reed, i kiddnapped you becasue i need your help',kingo says. 'Ok, I will help u just stopp druggin me, it isnt very nice', john reply. 'Alright, just stopp yellin and caring on like a crazy hamster under shock hearpy', relpys kingo. JOHn takes a deep breath and leans back in the chair. 'Ok lay it on me!' Kingo stepps back and sits down on the sofa,'ok i need u to brush Bunny's teeth'. 'WHAT??????', JOHN REPLYS. 'Who is Bunny and why do u wANt me to do that.'  Kingo looks a john and picks up bunny, 'bUNNY is the name of my losbter'.. 'oh ok phyco', repleys john. 'ok stop makin fun of me mr.reed, do u wanna lick the frog again??', replys kingo. 'O no, anything but that, i just dont understand, why cant u do it ur self?? 'very go qwestion, i have a allergy toward toothpaste, kingo says while crying. 'Stop that u look like a pansy',tells john reed. 'please mr.johnreed, (looks and hugs the lobster)bunny doesnt want to get a cavity, do u bunny??!!'. 'fine, after this will u let me go home, i have to watch the si-fi channel, there is a show without guns on tonighT', replys john. 'fair enough, or u could live there!', said kingo getting mighty excited,(jumping up and down like a little girl) ' we can sing NICK NACK PATTY WACK all day long.!!' NO no just let me do this and then take me home', john replys with wide eyes . KIngo hands the lobster to john and a small toothbrush just big enough for a lobster. it only take john about 5mins to brush the lobsters discolored teeth. 'done',says john. 'great job mr.johnreed', says kingo full of gratitude. 'I will take u home know but i must  drug u one more time. i dont want anyone finding out where i live!', kingo says while looking thorugh some boxes. all of a sudden the man takes out a vial of blue liquid, and shouts,'fair larwence lives on 4ever!!!' john looks up in dissbelief,'I will drink it, it is the only way to get away from this crazy insane man!!' john falls to the ground.  Â· 3 hours later john wakes up in the driveway of this home, dizzy. His dad is standing over him. Myron says,'i told u no drugs jon, this is very dissapointing.' .'but dad i didnt do drugs, i was kiddnapped.' 'i dont believe u, why would soemone kiddnapp u, thats why you are taking kun fu, so u dont get taken by anyone.' john stammers out,' but itys not kun fu'!! 'no i dont care what it is , get up stairs u are grounded for the next 3 weeks, and u are going to get spanked  100 times with a seat belt!!' 'great'. john returns to the kichen woundering weather he had dreamed the whole thing or if he really did meet the crazy man named kingo. 'o yeah by the why john,  meet the mayor of mansfield, he needs my help with  his job', says john dad, 'mr. kingostopper'. john turns white, kingos and johns eyes meet and john runs up to his room screaming and then gets into the fetal position and shakes. Back down stairs johns dad explains that john is on cyrstal meth and he screamed becasue that is how he says hello.' Kingo gives a chuckle a takes a sipp of tomato soup,'i dought that, he seemed like a very nice and useful young man'. 'whatever, so u need money, and i am a lown shark, so just tell me what u need'. All of a sudden Mryon is shot in the neck with a poisoness arrow by kingo, and he is dragged away. kingo says with a huge grin on his face,'THE MADDNESS WILL NEVER END,AWAWWWWWW'!!! **BEWARE**** **RED-RUMM** BY:DANIELLE C-2004-fishy isnât it??

I was on my way to my cousin's house ,who lives in Ashland. when I noticed something preticular about this town... the first thing that caught my eye about Ashland there was run down houses, and I noticed something else writing on sidewalks. Hmm Thats when I became very curious. Could this be? Ashland, a ghetto? Only there was one quality missin...the people. Then when we arrived. I saw across the street from my cousin's house... a old man wearing mix match clothes it was Neon Green shorts and a red top!! That made me think. Could Ashland be the second ghetto ,Next 2 Lexington of course. Then I took a look around, then the answer came to me... heavens yes... So I declare Ashland to be the second Ghetto of America.                'I'm not a animal, I don't eat my own crap!'                    -Me                       I'll explain the story behind the quote to you if you want

There  once was an cover up organization kinda like AA or Anger Management. it was supposed to deal  with people who had  cross eyes and who were ashamed of them.but that wasnt the real reason. it was to find out who had murder Fiar Larwence. the group met every wednesday at the the local bar. well the leader of the group was a man named County Paris.CoUnty Paris had the crazyest lazy  eyes ever!. The group was comprized of many tpyes of people but they all had cross eyes and they all wanted to find out who had killed Fiar Larwence.all they really did at the meetings was get really drunk and sing elton john songs. the group would most likely get into fights and claim that raddishes would take over the u.s. so they went to jail a lot. but it was all County Paris's fault b/c he though it would be a good idea to get drunk at the local bar. But in reality county paris just liked to get real drunk,bEAcuze he missed his really old friend, Fiar Larwence. he had been shearching the internet for rumors of he fiars death. AND one night had mad a big big break through. the group was meeting at the local bar and the County was sitting down with this wirerless laptop. he typed the words' i killed fiar larwence' on ask.com. the county had been in luck, there had been a website made that day that had to deal with someone claiming to have killed county paris. 'what a dumb person',paris declared. 'lets go you guys, he is in mansfield ohio.'. 'lets kill him,hahahhahahah!!!' They hitched a ride with a gay truck driver. so it took them 5 days to get to mansfield and when they did they had to find the man who had done it. so they askeda round and round tryed to tap peoples phone. one day they jusrt happened to be on marion ave and there car broke down. so they all walked up the closest house on the road from were there car was. County pARis knocked on the door and a strange friendly guy answered the door. 'ummm our car broke down,good man could you please be a dear and let me use ur phone?''' 'the name is myron,and no u cant because i deep fryed the phone this morning,s o it doesnt work.' 'but if u would like to come inside and have dinner with my family i would be trilled' paris said', ok that is very nice, do u have enough room for all 12 of us?? myron said,'we can have dinner outside.' come in mr.???'.'the name is county paris, no mr.'...'mr.countyParis, what a cool name' myron said. 'Fool, no mr. just county  paRIS/.' 'I asure u that i am not making fun of u,' myron declared. 'crazyeyes'. 'WHAT, no u ddint!',said paris. all of a sudden mr.johnreed walks down stairs and looks that the 2 poeple fighting. 'john go make dinner, we are going to have a picnic!!'.'ohhh oki will get out the tomato soup!!', ummmm, declares john. 'hes on crystal meth he doesnt know what he is saying.', myron relpys. 'ok',wishpers paris,'they u dont know a man by the name fiar larwence do u?' 'I think john might i have heard that name before.'myron all of a sudden ask paris were he got this funny hat at, and paris trys to glare at him but his eyes are wacken out of control. 'i think u need some help with those'!,said myron. 'i know that stupid',says paires,'i think i better have a talk with Mr.johnreed'. paris goes out into the back year were john is making soup over the hot fire.'hey wazz up dude??,says john'wazz ur name?' paris declared,' my name is county paris, i am looking for fiar larwence' u mean the guy that i killed??' 'that guy was so dumb, i killed him b/c he tryed to water my flowers,i told him to stay away but he kept on screwin with them, so i got out my sword cuz i dont believe in gun, and i be-headed him'. its that cool'?? The Fiar was my father and know i must kil u!!, declares paris. paris and john  get into a sword fight. john after a 20 min fight spears paris and then he falls to ground and dies. myron comes out and gives his son a hug and tells him,'i amm sure glad we gave u those kun fu lessons'/. john says,'dad, they are not kun fu lessons how many times do i have to tell u that.?'.. 'whatever,not important.' the point is that u arnt dead and that the gargen wasnt messed up.They burn the body and then they make some tomato soup.'i loove tomato soup',declares john...and life goes on, just a normal day @ the reeds!! the end by danille.c-2004
so there they were in the cotton candy shack. just bo jangles, mr.johnreed, caitlin, danielle, and the weird little kid.ever since they had been trapped in the shack, their brains had been on over drive trying to think of a way out of there. but of course the naughty bo jangles wasnt thinking cuz he was withdrawing from pot and cuz he is dumb. bo wasnt helping at all cuz he kept saying here was like no way out and that they would all die. and all of a sudden out of no where they started to hear the jeepers creepers song, so of course they got a little freaked out, cuz who wouldn't.but danielle assured them that jeepers creepers wasnt going to hurt them, but instead help them. bo jangles, being his stubborn self, didnât believe what danielle was saying. so bo got on the ground and started to gnaw on the bark floors and chant ignorant things. so caitlin went over to him and slapped him silly. so, of course, jeepers creepers showed up and brunt holes into the shack, with his eyes. in no time there was a hole big enough for everyone to get through. but jeepers creepers sensed fear in the little boy and he liked his bladder so he had to the little kid against the will of the others. but jeepers creepers, who was not bob anymore but a Canadian organ grinder. so the group thanked jeepers for getting them out and he flew away into the sky.{bye-bye:(*tear*...} so they returned to the qwest to find tacos. about 30 mins later bo jangles gave out a scream of pain. he had been bitten by a bug. johnreed, being an expert on bug bites, had seen this rare bite before. it was called a boss bug and if it isnt cured it could turn into amy's disease, which john had done a prodject on before. since they didnt have a can of tuna or a cacti they were going to have to let bo go through the horrible disease.so what else could they do, aww yes, return on their adventure. after an hour or so bo became,well to be very blunt, BOSSY. really bossy. he was telling everyone what to do and all of that kinda of stuff. so everyone decide to plot against him and put oragel in this mouth(which would make it num and stop him from talking.) john tricked him into drinking the whole bottle by telling him it was toothpaste and that his breath smelled really bad. being so full of himself he took it all in. after he had done so he looked like he was retarded. so they were still wondering through the corn field, but much faster,cuz bo couldnt tell everyone he needed to go to the bathroom every 10 mins, so he peed his pants a lot. then out of nowhere, in the middle of the corn field, was a tall man, who was about 7' 6 and was wearing a black trench coat and his hair was gelled back. he looked troubled or like he was in shreah for something very important. the group approached the man. they asked if they could help with anything. the man asked if they had seen e.t. , his long lost son. caitlin brust out into laughter and told the man, pointing to john, that john was e.t. john tried to tell him he wasnt, but the man wasnt going to take no as an answer. the man told john that he just wanted to make sure he was ok and that he wanted to make sure that e.t was happy on earth. john said yes. the man kissed and hugged john and then said,'fairwell son, and good day!!' john was pretty weirder out but he passed it off. by time the man had left the numbing gel had worn off and bo jangles began to act like his bossy self once again.but not only was he being bossy, his ego began to grow bigger and bigger. it was the size of a hot air balloon. he started to say that he was better then everyone else. so everyone was getting pretty hungry, and to their surprise in the middle, what would lie, but a meatloaf restaurant. when they walked they noticed the banner above their head it stated that the meatloaf was magical and that it was abundant and free. so they sat down for a wonderful feast of meatloaf, when, u guessed it, bo jangles began to fight with john. saying that he could eat more meatloaf then john. so bo,of coursed, challenged john to a meat loaf eating contest. john accepted because he is johnreed the kun-fu master that will never turn down a challenge. so they had the contest,. bo ate 15 loaves and john ate 3. so bo jangles went around celebrating his victory over john. but soon he got sick and puked out all 15 loaves of meatloaf. everyone started to laugh except bo who started to cry and he had a pity party for himself, nobody else joined cuz:-1. they were eating magical cheesecake and real cherries from the garden outside.and-2. bo smelled really bad. so after the cheese cake and the party was over they continued on their journey.&nbsp; after a while bo was so over whelmed that he fell into to the ground and began to say really crazy thongs about mongooses. so john being john had a little talk with him about his attitude. but bo&nbsp; wouldn't comply so john poked a presser point on him and they left bo jangles to die in the corn field of never ending corn..&nbsp; without the presence of bo jangle the group seemed to be doing alot better then they had been doing. u get the point. as the day turned to night they got tired and made corn beds like the Indians made and they fell asleep. they were awoken the next morning by the screams of john, he had had a bird poop on this face, which was really nasty and gross. but he wiped it off with a cob of, u guessed right, corn! so after a breakfast of creamy corn(by the way john had begun to get a yellow tint to his skin.,lol)they continued on the qwest,it wasnt to long before the corn ended and a street was now in front of peeps. they started to walk down the road when they noticed an ALDI's grocery store. they walked in looking for someone&nbsp; so they could ask where the heck they were. but as soon as they walked in who else would appear but the naughty, egotistic BO JANGLES.&nbsp; everyone was in shock. how did he manage to get to the store before they did.l bo jangles explained that as soon as they leaf him aliens abducted him and did weird things to him, like put silly putty in his brain and dye his liver purple. but that they had to stop and get some raisins .so they let him go cuz they were done with him. besides the fact that no body believed in him. but they were pretty mad at him so it really didnt matter. so bo had a dollar so he bought a bottle of ketchup. because he liked ketchup. and john remembered that he had a dollar in his shoe so he bought a container of&nbsp; mixed nuts that were also meat flavored.(how convenient for john,lol.) so they left the store while the girls were still trying to figure out where they were. but nobody seemed to know. so they left in disappointment while angry drug users tried to sell them street drugs and highway streets. but danielle insisted that they had 2 of everything. so as the girls pushed the crazy people out of the way, they rejoined the guys who were enjoying their treats. bo opened the ketchup bottle and took some in and spit it back out, cuz it was horrible. it tasted like crap. so bo jangles marched back into the store and complained about it to the person in charge. the sales worker took out a pistol and told bo to get out of the store if he didnt want 2 unwanted presents. bo sulked out the store and he shunned the store. he came out while the girls were making fun of johns mixed nuts. john, being an awful nice person, offered to share his new found treasure. but everyone declined, even bo,who would get anything. it made john kinda mad, but the wonderful taste of the meat flavored mixed nuts made him forget about his sorrow.&nbsp; while walking&nbsp; down the long street john decided that it was time for a sing along, so he took out his banjo keyring but bo that it was a ghetto idea and then insulted john by telling him that he was really ghetto. john, not like being called ghetto for any reason, got mad and bit off 2 of bo's fingers and ate them. bo was in a world of pain. not to mention that the blood was everywhere. but nothing could really be done. bo, in a word, was handicapped and mad.(i wounded why??) so danielle and caitlin played doctor and wrapped up bo's flesh wound. but somewhere in the middle danielle went over to talk to john about the word'ghetto'. which didnt make john to happy. soon the 2 were fighting over ghettos:real or made up. but they came to a tie b/c danille changed the subject to bo. john still mad said he was sorry to bo.&nbsp; but bo was still really mad at john for what he had done, so he wasnt talking to him. so what else could they do but continue on there qwest.bo still upset started to sing the song,'stacy's mom.' over and over again. everyone thought it was kinda weird and sick, but nothing else could make the sad boy happy. so then john got mad b/c he saw a pile of rocks and he got depressed b/c he thought even a rock whould reject.the girls tried to tell him different and hold him that he was not acting rash. so then about 2 days passed when they came across a road that intersected with the one they were on. the road was named ocean ave. john got really excited and started to jump and scream and lose control of everything. john finally got control and told his peeps that road ended in his back yard, and it was only about 4 miles, and that they were going to be home by night time. and was good because they were tired of liven in the presence of corn and need to take a bath. esp. bo jangles b/c he smelled of puke and ketchup. so they skipped home. and when they got there all of there parents where there and they all acted like nothing had happened.which was weird. but nobody wanted to ask qwestion. the only person that had gotten in trouble was john b/c all of the parents had come up with this crazy idea that john had kidnapped all of them. so john couldnt watch the sci-fi channel or any other channel(except weather) for a year. cuz he must have seen the prank on some movie. and nobody wanted to get into trouble so they just agreed that was what had happened. so they all made it home safely never to tell what had happened! I think the only qwestion was, did bo and john make up?? well thats a story for another time.  by:danielle c-2004. holla.!!!!! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

Hmm...it's been a while since I ever use a blog again. Kind of lose the last blogger that I used last time. Hehe, never mind. Shall start over again.  Haiz..today is the 'Meet Parents' Day'. And of course, i'm included. (as usual though coz almost everybody else have to go) Miraculously, my father decided to sent me n my mother to school...(it is unusual of him to do that, since he always prefers staying at home and sleep all his want since it is a day off for him as it's the holidays for the students, and he need not teach) Well, it's been raining ever since I woke up. And it only stops until now. The weather is kind of cool...pretty good for time to take a nap...Felt like cuddling up my pillow n goes to sleep..Haha. But alas! I've to go to school in such a weather. And redeem my results slip.  Cool as it is, bright as it seems...but there'isnt alot of students around that time...Guess every other students chooses a time as early as 10 to collect theirs...and only a couple of unlucky teens (like me) choose such a time where everyone is back at home, watching tvs and enjoying themselves...11.45 am is the time.   The first thing i saw when I entered the school...was DT! With 3 other pupils...Yep, all 3 of them are from my class...Dont know what's up with them...and DT...As far as I know, they must have commited something wrong that DT wanted to see all 3 of them. And from their faces, they aren't looking kinda good. Trying not to be nosey, I dragged my mom to my class...where Mr Wong (my form teacher) is.   Well, guess we were the last ones to be seen...There's someone in there...someone familiar...Ok, it's my sort of father's sister's son. (Well, I dont know how to call it, a long-distance relative, maybe?) Anyway, he was there...together with his...erm mother. At first glance, I thought it was my aunt. but then again when they came out, it was not. It took about 15 minutes for them before they come out from that room. And when they came out, his mother greeted my mom. And then when we entered, the first thing mr Wong said wad 'Your related one ar?' And I nodded...  And here it goes....my result slip. It doesn't looks pretty nice...I failed 2 subjects. Haiz...Oh well, guess I've to buck up for my final year..just like what I did last year! I aimed to get back my position for Top 10! Muahahahaha... I've noticed....I always get a pretty lousy results for Mid Year Examinations....and only when Final Year, then my results are of the better. This year, I'm not going to let my parents down either! Afterall, it's an important year! =D  Mr Wong goes on and on about how I can improve on it...and I'm determined to prove that I can do well...and I am made of something! Lolx.. He even suggested me to buy the Ten Year Series books to practise on. And oh yeah, he even asked for my home number...I sure hoped he won't call when I'm least expected. After all, I'm a good student!   Yawn...it's 3pm now..Guess I've got to stop. Today's kind of ok. I'm so bored with nothing to do now...Maybe I should go back on reading the comics...And I just can't wait for tomorrow! Haha, coz I'm going out to redeem the Jolin's Concert Tickets...Well let's hope that at least I could get them.   Laters!
Haiz...today planning to go orchard to redeem my Jolin's Mini Concert tickets...Never know that there will be so many people redeeming it. I went out at noon...then when we reach there, it was around 1pm.. And when we got there..i am utterly shocked! There's already a LONG queue there...God, why am I always so 'sway'? But then, I was prepared for the worst...I knew even if i queue up together with the others, i definitely doesn't stand a chance....so, forget it. =[  And just to make myself feel better..I decided to catch a movie! Yep! And I wanted to watch the Day After Tomorrow..but Jiali wanted Shrek2...then we decided to see which movie comes first and decided on which one to watch. And in the end, Shrek 2 shows at 1.30pm and DAT is at 2pm...and I was like, 'Oh man...' Then I started to begged her on watch DAT instead. Then after some convincing, hehehe, I finally talked her into watch Day After Tomorrow instead! (Woohoo~) JiaLi rulez!! (LOlx)  Anyway, as I was saying...we bought the tickets and we have about an hour's time before the movie starts so we went to isetan (which is just below the cinema) and shop around. Haha, we've been to many departments...and like I said, there's a doll which looks REALLy like Jiali! Muahahaha..(oops hope she isn't reading this)and I told her that and she totally disagress with me..  Anyway, we went to the stationary department and I finally found the BLACK shaker!! Hehehehehe!! Well, I know I am wasting money but this is the only way to make me feel better after the loss of the 2 tickets for the Jolin's concert. And time flies, it is almost 2pm when the shows going to start. So we decided to go and make the preparations (like buying popcorns...lolx) And then we finally entered the cinema.  Wow! The show's REALLy awesome! It's the best movie I ever watched!! And Jiali even wanted for the toilet...but i told her not to go. Coz if she were to leave her seat, at any point of time, it's gonna be another great scene that she missed! And finally she tolerate through the whole movie. And it's absolutely a nice movie! So stimulating and romantic(for some parts). Especially how the girl hugs Sam when he was freezing cold after coming up from basement. And the most thrilling part is when the HUGE WAVES of seawater came rushing down to the city! And everyone is running for help...except for the girl who tries to help the old lady getting back her passport...Then Sam came to her resuce...and they are safe and sound! It's really a cool movie!! Like whaT DT have said...Haha  After coming out of the theatre, the first thing we did was rush to the toilet! And God! we didnt even manage to finish the popcorn! We left about 1/2 of the popcorns..coz both of us were to full to continue eating. And after sometimes, I keep talking to her that how great the movie is! And I am SO proud of myself that I told her to watch DAT instead of Shrek! Hehe, no la. Just kidding...lolx  Anyway, later we went over to heeren and planning to go over there and do some shopping..But then as I passed by popular, i decided to stop by and buy a couple of assesment books for myself. Coz my grades really have gone down! And I must do something about it this June Holidays!! Haiz...that means it's still looks like schooling for me...  After that, we went over to heeren...and on the way, jiali stomach pain...Told her to go toilet first liao, she dun listen..Like I always said 'Whenever you need a toilet you cant find one, whenever you dont need one, it keeps appearing' And I was absolutely right about this! She refused to go at first, and when we walked half way and about to heeren, she suddenly stomach pain! Then she say she can't stand it and have to go for the toilets. And luckily we reached there and she took quite a while before she comes out. And I was starting to get bored too, lolx!   Finally, we went to HMV...I was looking for the Marykate and Ashley's VCD..hoping that the price will go down. But instead, the VCD is gone! Haiz...sway lor..I guess. Then forget it, we headed for the bus and went back to BukitMerah Interchange to buy me and my mom's dinner. And then we went back home.  Oh yeah! I forgot that I need to buy the Lime Magazine where this month features quite a lot of my favourite people in it! Great! Really sway ar, today!!! Forget it!  Haiz...  Oh well, me go have dinner liao...  Laters!!
Wahhhh!! I cant believe I am SOoO unlucky! Remember yesterday I said that I was going to Orchard to redemm my tickets? Well, yeah indeed! There's leftovers for the tickets in the hello! shop. I got the news from an email sent by my online friends. They said that they came even at 4 something(which was the time when I went there again the second time)and they could redemm the tickets without fear! Argh!!  I thought with such a queue, surely the tickets have been out like hotcakes! But no! And worst of all, they can choose whatever they want! Not according to the amount of people! And most of the people chooses other merchandise like the DVD and posters and the passes. That's why there's so many leftover tickets! But then again, when I read on with the email, I realize something! No wonder the people don't want the tickets! If they had the tickets, they have to apply for a new line! And that means they have to spend more money for a pair of tickets,and it is not worth it at all! That's why almost everyone want something else!  Geez, now that I know the truth about it,I wasn't that upset over it. Coz even if I got the tickets, I couldnt have gone to the concert without applying for another line. Moreover, I've already got the DVD..I dont see why I need another one. And for the passes, erm I dont kinda have the time to queue up with those fans to get just the autograph of Jolin! So, I think I will pass up that too! Lastly, for the LIMITED edition Poster...it's kind of waste though..But still then again, even if i got the poster, i would just throw it one side like the poster doesn't exist. So, after all these serious thinking, I wasn't THAT depress on them.   Afterall, the best thing is, I've had a wonderful time in Orchard! That's the most important thing...                                      ************   Oh yeah! I got the news from a friend in the japanese exchange program that May and her partner got a tiff over something. Ha! Serve May right! (Hey, I'm not being mean here. But she really deserve that! Since she've been acting all the while! Trying to be teacher's pet. Though she still failed. And always acting cute! I can't stand people of this kind!) And god, she even cried! (Muahahahahaha!!!) My friend did absolutely the right thing! Ha! Know what she did? She actually treat my friend as HER maid! She kept ordering her to do things for her when my friend herself needed to do her own. And she even wanted my friend to help her keep her dirty clothes while she bathe! How could she! And that's not her first time, according to my friend. That's why my friend could tolerate no more and quarrel with her! (Good job! Hehe!)  And she even dare to complained all that to E and A (shortforms..) Then they told my friend about it. That's how she learnt that. And for 2 solid days, whenever May wanted to talk to my friend, she ignored her. (Wee!! Way to go!!)I bet May definitely doesn't have a good time in japan! Hahahaha!! That's something glad to hear. And to think she was still looking so forward to it! This should teach her a lesson!   Oh well..I've to go now..Going to catch my favourite tv shows.. Lolx  Laters!!
Ugh! I'm damn sway...Havent been writing for awhile lately eh? Haha   Early in the morning, go down the road to hop on my father's car, and nearly tripped on a couple of 'invisible' stones! It is camouflage in the grass by the way...that's why I didnt notice it. And somehow it is still early and of 'coz the sun hasn't risen and neither could I see clearly...That's how, I almost fell...  Luckily I regain my balance as soon...and my father also grabbed me just in time (My knight in shiny armor) Lolx... Well, first thing in the morning nearly tripped...What more comes next? Yeah, I know there's bound to be loads more install for me! And I was quite right if you ask me!  When I got to school...everything was still allright until the last 2 periods! First was the Chinese, our Chinese teacher told us that we're not allow to use the dictionary 'coz we already know what's coming out for the test, so she forbid us from using it. And then she didnt turn up today for our test, but the test still is carried out somehow, with another teacher of course. And fair enough, we got the same topic and (hehe I've memorise everything, though I've changed some of the words 'coz I can't seem to remember all...OoPs) I started it quickly...'coz we dont have much time after we came back from the Com Lab...and it left us about 20 minutes to complete it instead of 35!  But half way through, the teacher told us we can use the dictionary! My mouth dropped open! I thought 'Didnt she told us we cannot use it? How come now can use??' Oh&nbsp; well, after all I've memorise most of them, there's no further need for me to get a dictionary now...since there isnt much to be look up in the dictionary. So I quickly finish the letter writing, and was the second to finish, but wasn't the second to hand it in...'Coz I dont want to hand up a piece of work with mistakes! So I counter check it.  Then, the teacher broke out the news that we are having another letter writing test on the upcoming Tuesday...and this time it is the formal type. And we are asked to learn the format ourselves. But as she is kind, she decided to go through with us on behalf of our teacher. And we were asked to stay back after school for 10 minutes to go through it...that wasn't so bad. But the worst has yet to come!  She decided to run to ask the HOD of Chinese Department whether she can ownself conduct the extra lessons with us and then when she ask whether she can trust us on not copying when she leaves...and she choose to trust us! I couldnt believe that! And when she left, everyone started to take out their papers and copy...until she came back. And everyone manages to finish it somehow...not all though. -_-'  Chemistry is the next lesson....I hate it! 'Coz that teacher totally sucks! He teaches so quickly and when students ask questions about it, he will yell at them! How weird! And he always like to pass sarcastic remarks on those he dislike! Thanks god, he dont dislike me...He actually treat my classmate a ghost! And he likes to give nicks to anyone he hates! And sway...when he tested us on the Equations, I got picked! 'Coz I was 16! And 15 didnt come! So he decided on 16! Then i go up, shaking....dont know what to write. I look around asking for help. Got some help from some of them, and then he decided that we can get help from someone...and if we cant complete it by today, all of us have to stay back!   Inorder to get everyone safely back home, I quickly ask the Chemistry Experts! True enough, I got the answers...but whether or not it's right he didnt say. But for the other team, he didnt got it right, and somehow have to stay back for detention. I thought he was going to say 'Who was the other one that was up there, that couldnt answer the question just now?'(me) But I was standing there, praying hard he won't. And whew! He didnt!  I think he either forgotten about me or I really did get the right answers. Haha...  Kinda sway today right? But I cant wait for Sunday! 'Coz I'd be going to the library and borrow some cool books home..And I cant wait for Wednesday Night either! 'Coz my brother is coming back! And then, I can finally get my hands on the gifts he is bringing back! Hehe...I sure hope he got the things I like...  Okay.   Laters!!
Weee!!! Today is a saturday! And tomorrow I'd be going out...
Ok can anyone enlighten me here has to how I list other people's blogs on mine as I can't find anywhere where I can do it, it's probably staring me right in the face, cause sometimes I can't see for looking!!!!  Kate.
Just read this that someone posted on the OS, is it me or does he mention 3 different releases here......  From Ross Halfin's Diary on his website:  Thought I'd have a lazy Sunday. Checked my diary and realised the person who does it hasn't put any recent pictures up.....I'll rectify this today. Speak to Phil Collen, haven't spoken to him in a year, he tells me there's a Def Leppard Greatest Hits CD coming out for Christmas (again) and a rock version of Vault. He thinks the record company are flogging a dead horse and he's had nothing to do with it. He's in London for a couple of weeks. Told him Joe had played me the covers album they'd done....Phil seemed very disheartened by it all....I must say they've done a great version of Rock On by David Essex (won't tell you the rest as it'll spoil it).  1. Def Leppard Greatest Hits CD 2. Rock version of Vault (or does he mean the above is a rock version of Vault) 3. Covers album  Why would they release 3 all round about the same time, although not sure when the cover album is due, they ought to call one of em Dazed and Confused cause I know I am lol.  Kate.
I can't believe the weekend is nearly over, I haven't done anything hardly apart from recover all day yesterday from Friday night out with the girls, then got rid of 5 black bin liners of crap from the spare bedroom today, where it came form I've no idea as it doesn't look like there's less stuff in there.  Oh well feel better for the clean out.  Didn't have the internet last night as hubby was messing with the cables, I felt so lost, I didn't realise how much I use it and depended on it, have I no life lol?  Kate.
Driving to work I saw this Sky TV van parked at the side of the road, I nearly crashed the car as the paintwork on it was huge leopard print, covered every inch of it, it was soooo cool.  I'm so glad it's Friday, it's been the longest week of my life.  Kate.
Ooh I can't wait till tomorrow is over and the weekend is here, its been one hell of a week at work for me, everything has gone wrong, it got so bad at one point I could have said stuff this and walked right out.  Yeeeeaaaahh........my friend just phoned to see if I want a girlie night out tomorrow night....you bet I do, yeahhaaa................baby it's showtime!!!!  Kate.
Well I thought it was about time I started a Blog seeing as it seems to be the craze of late, don't know how it will take off, I might even get bored at some point with it but we will see.  Kate.
For shear genius,  urlLink Foucault's Pendulum  swings ellispse's around  The Da Vinci Code . The protagonists of Foucault's Pendulum try to prove a point that the afficiandos of the Knights Templar would believe anything...so they make up their own phenomenal history of man--complete with prophesies and death rituals. They soon find themselves pulled into the maddening world of cultists and true believers...and, of course, satanic death rituals.  For genius and plot  Foucault's Pendulum  stands heads above the Code, yet it suffers one fault: The book is long and tedious. I suspect if I really got into masonic writings and long conspiracy theories, I would find it all long and tedious as well. Three quarters of the way through the book, I was fed up with all the cultist idiocies, and just wanted the book to end. There's a large number of people who would believe anything you stuff under their chin...now get to the end....please.  It is interesting the way that people really want to believe in big plots and grand theological conspiracies. Even more interesting is the way that many people really want to play a part in the great fictional dramas. They kidnap young girls, they fly planes into buildings because they feel they have to somehow be a praxis in the grand social movements of time. They read pieces of fiction with their eyes curled up as they ride Trax to the towering granite ediface in the center of town believing that it will give them some secret hidden powers over their enemies. (For those who are wondering. If you ride inbound Trax you will often see people reading a strange book with their eyes curled up as they try to conjure the hidden powers between the words of the book. I was watching one of these creature one day. The creature was literally shaking as he read. He suddenly developed the most sinister grin on his face that I had ever witnessed. The creature closed his eyes and lipped the words he found...ingraining them in his memory. I was obviously witnessing the birth of a great political strike against this creature's enemies. The creature got off at the towering granite ediface stop.  There are times when I really question why I live in the place where I live. I like the mountains and deserts, but I really have a hard time working for people ruled by revelation.  Back to fiction. In many ways, I agree with Orson Scott Card that Science Fiction really is one of the best formats for exploring theological concepts. When accepted as fiction, the format really lets our minds explore different ideas. We can connect absurdities like Umberto Eco. The open acknowledgement of a scifi book as fiction lets us see different ideas without the precept of having to take them for anything more than entertainment. The method works best for people who see all of the wonderously different ideas that can exists.  Fiction can open our eyes to the way the world works because fiction allows the author the ability to really focus in on ideas that nonfiction lacks.  Yet there is also a strange point where cultism, theology, guruism and pure fiction collide. This is what I find troubling. We create a fiction, then people build on that fiction. They destroy that which does not fit in their world, etc..  I guess I should mention, when I was reading Foucault's Pendulum, I had a rather dull witted boss. He could not understand the ending of the book. Caught up in the strange cult history portrayed by the book, he could not understand why Umberto Eco ended the book THAT WAY!!!!  Could there have been any other way? The ending seemed obvious from the first page. There was just the game of connecting dots and seeing just how the predictible ending would come about.  In this regard, the plot of the Da Vinci thriller was better designed. We did not know the true identity of the grand villian until the last chapter. More of a thriller, the ending was quite interesting in that after the villian was unveiled, all of the strange creatures in the book turned out to be normal people...while the ending of Foulcault's Pendulum comes off as a let down. Even worse, some of the 'normal people' suddenly seem like monsters.
I finally read the  urlLink Da Vinci Code . It was a fun fast paced read. It was much better than  Digital Fortress .   In the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown put together a nice coherent plot, likeable characters and enough controversy to get people talking. Apparently, people are eating the book up. It has been in print for over a year and there is still a waiting list at the library and used copies of the book have not dropped to the dollar level which generally happens as a best sellers move into the yesterday news category.  Overall, I found the book a fun work of fiction that provided some interesting insights into my favorite characters of history.  I do have to admit. In many ways, I am turned off by the message from many pop books and movies that paganism is somehow a superior (more rational and or more balanced) form of spirituality than christianity.   Yet, overall, I think the primary message of the book was on target. The book gives a strong reminder that the victors tend to rewrite history. Trying to actually base our life on any form of ancient writing is rather foolish as ancient writings have been seriously manipulated throughout the years.  The political forces of the dark ages led to a systematic destruction of the science and culture of the ancient Greeks. The destruction was similar to what we saw the Taliban doing in Afghanistan and we see the Islamic clerics doing in Iran. In order to add more legitimacy to one set of books and icons, there is a concerted effort to destroy other competing systems of thought.  As for people destroying history for religious reasons, here in Utah we actually have an extremely large and powerful University that actively works to falsely interpret the history of the Maya, Aztecs and other native Americans to fit what is, most likely, a fictional account of the Americas.  To add an element of conflict to the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown gives the reader the grand daddy of all conflicts...the conflict between man and women. The primary premise of the book is that the Vatican has conspired to destroy the sacred female. The priory of sion is actively engaged in trying to preserve the ancient religious texts that hold a different role for women.  The idea of a central conflict ruling the entire history of mankind is extremely compelling. This is much like what Hegel was doing with his Philosophy of History. He had the world moving through these thesis/antithesis conflicts. Claiming to be a scientist, and claiming his conflicts were scientific, Hegel gave the world a very compelling history.  Having fictional scholars speak authoratively on a controversial subject is a strong literary device. I can see why the book shelves are now full of refutations of the Da Vinci Code as the different fictional accounts of history battle eachother for supremacy.   As for real history. A few days ago I saw the tale end of an interview by Richard Rubenstein for a work called  Aristotle's Children . I placed an order for the book, and am looking forward to its arrival on my doorstep.  If we really want to look at fundamental conflicts at the foundation of society, I think that looking at the ebb and flow of interest in logic is far more telling indicator of the progress of civilization that the conflicts of religion. It seems to me that when there is a due appreciation of logic, the society rises. When the society is dominated by revelation and mumbo jumbo...it declines.
Well, my webhost was out for most the day and all my sites were down. Fortunately, I am finally  urlLink back up . There error messages were all saying that the disk on the host was full, and all database connections were consumed. &nbsp; So I am left wondering it it was a problem with my code gone wild, if it was a simple hardware failure, or if another site on the web host having problems. My logs did not show unusual activity. There were several malformed bots on my sites today. Days like this make me wish I had access to the server.
Looks like Blogger now has a program to add comments to entries. &nbsp; It's typical, about a month ago,&nbsp; I finally sat down and wrote a program to track blogger comments. Oh well, I would rather use the blogger program. &nbsp; Anyway, I just changed my profile, and erased the links to the small number of comments that were left on my site. I apologize to the two people who took time to respond to posts in the past.
I just made my first electronic quarterly tax payment with the IRS EFTPS tax payment system; So, I saved a stamp, saved Cliff Clavin the effort of sorting and delivering mail, and saved the effort involved in having an office federal letter-opener-person open an envelope. &nbsp; Having done all that, I now need to make my complaint about how stupid it is that we pay taxes on estimated amounts. I haven't a clue about how much money I will make this year.&nbsp; If people&nbsp;visit  urlLink my get rich quick scheme , I might get rich&nbsp;quick. In all&nbsp;likelihood sanity will&nbsp;prevail and I will&nbsp;keep having to work temp jobs for food. &nbsp; Personally, I think the best way to handle taxes would be to define a special tax account at a bank. Taxes would be assessed as money is withdrawn from the account. If the taxes were taxen out automatically as we did our day to day business, people could better manage their tax liabilities...rather than playing this silly estimating and tax return games that the IRS requires.
This is cool, the www.whois.sc service will show you the number of times a domain is listed in DMOZ. The format of the URL is www.whois.sc/domain.com. For example ( urlLink http://www.whois.sc./dmoz/descmath.com  shows that my little math site is in the directory. Oddly, this info is hard to find in DMOZ itself. Searching on a domain name does not always return a result. I suspect however that this is only accurate relevant after a directory crawl.
On 7/7 I added to the community directories sites for  urlLink Glenwood Springs, Colorado  and  urlLink Colorado Springs . Glenwood Springs scored high on my list of place I would evacuate to if I left Salt Lake. Of course, I continue the process of spreading myself too thin. I added Colorado Springs because about every third link I find when looking for web sites in Colorado seem to come from Colorado Springs. Being a cad, I spent the last two days dropping in the ad layers for the sites. I will have to start adding content.
The left believes that we should centralize power through ever larger government bureaucracies and controls. The right believes in centralization of power through market manipulations and corporate consolidation.  Hmmm, I wonder where the people who&nbsp;believe centralization of power itself is the problem are to go?
The two new get rich schemes&nbsp;include a  urlLink BYU Cougars Gear  page and a  urlLink Back to School Page .&nbsp;  Last year, the attempt at a back to school page netted zero. Quite frankly, I think people have too much garbage. I stuck a silent plea for people to ride their bikes to school (as opposed to driving). As fo the BYU page, being a U fan, I think it would be an absolute hoot if it made any sales...if I succeed, I will need to treat myself to a beer.   I agree it is stupid the way that everyone spends so much of their day running around trying to make cash. I wonder if the message 'think more spend less' could perpetuate itself when attached to an ad.
I've only seen bits and pieces of the hype surrounding the 9/11 Commission report. Everything I've seen has got my bogus meters flashing full.  The main gist of the 9/11 commissiont is that there was just too much of that freedom thing going down in the United States and now we a more powerful centralized police to protect the nation's interests. Yep, their&nbsp;conclusion seems to be to do unto the US what Al Quaida wished to do unto the US...curtail freedom.  The report claims that 9/11 was a failure of the imagination. Then they go on to report that the security experts&nbsp;are now&nbsp;imagining things much worse than 9/11 . The implication is that we are much greater danger because security experts are imagining more.   If anything, there is an reverse relation to what the security experts imagine and our overall safety. The fact that people are much more attentive has increased security.  Now, the fact that we are actively&nbsp;engaged in a war means that security risks are greater. What the experts are, or are not imagining does not dictate the extent to which the US enemies wish to do us harm. The experts' imaginations affect their attentiveness. It does not affect the sentiment of Al Quaida.  The big failure of the pre 9/11 world was not the lack of centralization of security forces, nor even the imaginations of security experts. It is the fact that the US and the western world had turned a blind eye to the oppressive regimes, overpopulation and disaffection of&nbsp;the Islamic world.  If the puppet governments in Iraq and Afghanistan simply turn into the corrupt nepotistic regimes that the US has installed in the past, then we have two new breeding grounds for anti American terrorists...just as the corrupt Saudi Arabia was the breeding ground for the 9/11 terrorists.  If we end up with states like those put in place by George Bush the first, then America is in deep trouble...between now and the next war, the technology gap is likely to lessen.
Here's one for the shrinks. Anyway, I dreamed that Coco, a medium sized black dog, had a zipper. For some odd reason, I had put my shoes in the pouch behind the zipper.  &nbsp; So, I was was walking along. Suddenly, I was in&nbsp;a fierce winter storm.&nbsp;I decided that I wanted my shoes, but Coco would not let me unzip&nbsp;her zipper. She kept curling up and chewing on her leg&nbsp;everytime I tired to open her. &nbsp; Deep down, I think this dream is my subconcious telling me that dogs really do not make very good luggage even though they are just about the right size for carry on.
I caught the end of  urlLink le tour france  on cable. I have to admit that cycling is truly a beautiful event. Watching the waving motions of the peloton is truly hypnotic.  I've always seen cycling as a lone wolf sort of sport. It is a challenge against one's self. I enjoy being way out on an empty country road cycling by myself grooving with nature. I never really understood why there were teams, or why people bothered competing.  Quite frankly, in recent years, I've been extremely turned off by the Utah Mountain Cylcling scene ( urlLink iMoab.com ) which is into this extreme 'tear up the desert' free falls down the face of cliffs. Yes, mountain bikes can do as much damage to the wilderness as a jeep...or a stick of dynamite. I tend to limit my mountain biking to roads. Trail ride does too much damage to a trail. The mountain bike is the best way to experience canyonlands or the swell...but there's enough roads already in existence. I don't need to carve a new one with my fat tires.  Anyway, seeing, a well formed peleton is rejuvenating. I can now understand why cyclists go through all the hassles of the professional racing circuits to build up the skills ncessary to ride in such a formation. The race itself forms a work of art. If I were to try and ride in such a formation, I would twist the wrong way and knock everybody down. They other cyclists would get reall upset.
Oil prices hit historic highs. The stock market seems to be in a free fall as a the result.  The one biggest fault that I find with the Bush administration is that it is not using this increase in oil prices to push for long term reduction in our use of oil.  Conservation is not simply about having less...it is about structuring our lives so that we get the absolute most from the resources that we consume. In this regard, I think the steady increase in gas prices is actually healthy for the economy since it is focussing people's attention on efficiency. For that matter, one of the first jobs I had was to use information technology to help reduce the fuel consumption of a fleet of trucks. The rising cost of a resource created a need for people to figure out how to get more from the resources consumed.  I also had temp jobs in construction. The firms I worked for were actively eying the cost of materials. When the cost of wood was high, they would employ people to salvage the wood. When it was low, the wood added to the landfills. Pulling nails from lumber is not the best job, but it is worthwhile in that it shows a tendency to maximize the return from invested resources as the price of the resource rose.  I think it is the nature of humans to become destructive when the price of resources is too low.  Anyway, hopefully the rise in the price of fuel is getting people to think about ways to realign their lives and businesses to be less dependent on oil. Is is possible to shorten the commute? Or perhaps it is possible to own two cars: a economy car for every day travel, then the gas guzzling jeep for rare excursions?  Sadly, our fearless leader is not really taking this opportunity to push long term conservation. Oil prices are rising and Bush's circle of oil buddies are getting richer than ever. Bush looks at the economy. His circle of friends is getting richer than ever before. Nothing wrong here!!!!!!!  As for my get rich quick schemes (I really should call these a get to minimum wage quick scheme), I've added a  urlLink Back to School  page and a  urlLink Earth Friendly  products page to the various web sites. In my attempts to put your money where my mouth is, it seems that what I should try to do with the sites is emphasize quality over quantity and sustainable living.
The income side of the equation is still too weak. I've been very good about lowering expectations, but the old income seems to be lowering itself even faster than the expectations.    Anyway, I end up wasting the first several days of each month brooding over the income question. Yuck! Anyway, I was thinking of concentrating the money making schems in the area of  urlLink personalized products . The area of custom engraving is a place where the internet can excel.  At least marketing takes up very little brain cells...it just eats up pride. Of course, none of the other little projects are going that well. I keep finding areas that I need to research before completing any of the other sites.
A lot of people believe that an employerâs decision on  hiring a candidate depends on just skills and experience.  Well they couldnât be farther from the truth because that is  false.    Here is the truthâ¦      Skills and experience within your profession arenât what  gets candidates the job. The truth is that there are too  many candidates with the proper skills and experience to get  the job, and ONLY one usually gets the job.       Companies are looking for more than skills and  experience these days. So itâs extremely important that you  all your individual characteristics mirror your passion.    So what are the other factors that are usually invisible to  candidates?   **Self-Awareness** â who are you and where are you going?  What are your plans for the present and the future? How do  you know what you want? How do you know that youâre right  for this job? Employers want to make sure that youâre not  lost.   **Learning Skills** â Are you willing to learn? Are you  current on trends and technology? Are you a person who loves  to âgrowâ within their profession? You want to show an  employer that youâre a candidate that learns in order to  progress your career.    **Adaptability** - With everything changing so rapidly  today, itâs possible that tomorrow your skills may no longer  be relevant. Are you a person who adapts well to change?   **Character** - Do you show passion in your industry,  because when you do, it projects through your rÃ©sumÃ©, cover  letter, and especially during the interview. An employer  wants a dependable trustworthy employee. The more you  project your positive character, the better!        You can have a huge advantage over your competition by  going one step. Create a career portfolio and within it make  sure that you showcase all the categories above in the  proper manner. I guarantee that this will give you a major  edge over your competition.        So you see that itâs not all about skills and  experience. Itâs really important that you consider the  factors above, because them alone can get you the job.     =========================================================== David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

Emailing may seem simple, but there are some complications that you need to be aware of, otherwise, your email may never be read by an employer.   1.) Your subject line is crucialâ¦   How would you like the employer to be drooling to read your rÃ©sumÃ©? Of course you would, right? Because that will increase the likelihood that the employer will read you whole cover letter and rÃ©sumÃ©.   Note: An employer usually takes 10 â 15 seconds to overview a cover letter and read it.   It is to your advantage that they completely absorb your cover letter and rÃ©sumÃ©. The subject line of to your email can create this urgency, this excitement, and this greed within the emotions of an employer.   To give you proof of what I just said, what motivates you to read most of the articles that you like to read? I bet itâs the headline. Nine times out of ten, if the headline doesnât interest you, then you wonât read it.   Itâs no different with an employerâ¦they are human just like you. We read what we want to read and what we read usually strikes our interest.   Tips on writing a magnetic headline:   ** Write a subject line addressing the company needs, NOT yours.  Ex. I have ___accomplishments to provide value toward ____ position   ** Put the employerâs name in the subject line (notice the cliff hanger as wellâ¦)  Ex. Hi Dave, I love your product and I would like to work forâ¦   ** Stir the employerâs emotions by teasing them with value.  Ex. Here is how can increase your sales by 8%  Ex. How would you like a lawyer who has won 98% of the time!  Ex. I am used to communicating with dozens of people who recommend me to other friends.   3.) Houston we have a problem with spam filters   According to Time Magazine, between 40-70% of all email is getting killed (Spam Filtered) BEFORE anyone has a chance to read it? Itâs true!   You may think an employer is getting an email but nope it never reaches the email inbox because the spam filters stole it like a thief in the night.   What can you do to make sure your email arrives to an employer?   You have a choice. You can ask if the company uses a spam filter or you can assume that they do. I donât know the exact statistic for the exact number of companies that use spam filters, but I would make an educated guess that itâs 50% at least.   I would say that your best bet would be to prepare for the spam filter. The spam filters have a point system. Now usually when a email has more than 5 points then your email will ether not make it to the inbox or it will be place in the spam filter folder.   To give you an example on how the point system words: If you have âFreeâ anywhere in your message and especially in the subject line, you will receive 2 points automatically. There are many words that trigger points, and its way too long and boring to go through all of them. So here isâ¦   A free resource which detects your point system of an email:   lyris.com/contentchecker   3.) How should I send my rÃ©sumÃ©?   Before I begin writing about how to send your rÃ©sumÃ© it is critical that you ALWAYS include a cover letter with your rÃ©sumÃ©. Thatâs right, even when you send it through email.   You actually have a choice. You can send your rÃ©sumÃ© and cover letter in the body of the email, or as an attachment.   Beware! Sending your rÃ©sumÃ© as an attachment could cause it to be scrambled or lose it format structure during its journey. This means that an employer wouldnât be able to read or have trouble reading your rÃ©sumÃ©. So how can prevent this from happening?   Send an email to yourself. Go to msn.com and yahoo.com to get a free email account from each. Then send your rÃ©sumÃ© and cover letter from one to another and see whether your rÃ©sumÃ© and cover letter are formatted correctly.   Should I send my rÃ©sumÃ© and cover letter in the body of the email or as an attachment? I recommend that you do both. That way you know the employer will be able to read it, no matter what.   Check with the email content checker above and see whether your email with the attachment has under 5 points. If not, then I recommend that you send two emails to the employerâs inbox. The first has the attachment and cover letter and resume in the body of the email as well. Then send another email with just the cover letter and resume in the body of the email.   ========================================================  David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

There are over 6 Billion people on earth, and to no surprise there arenât 6 billion jobs to equal the score. As a matter of fact, there arenât even 1 billion jobs in the world today.   What does this mean for you?       You have plenty of competition in your industry and the numbers arenât getting any smaller. There is a new person born in your industry every minute. So for you to stay in the elite crowd or join the elite crowd in your industry you have to create what I call a âDistinguished Identity.â   What makes you special in your industry?  What have you done that very few have done in your industry?  What can and what will you provide on a guaranteed basics?        These are all questions that employers want to see within you. The job of the employer is often tough because they have to search to find out whatâs within an individual. The employer or recruiter has to search if nothing stands out to be beneficial to the job. Most employers are to mature to go hide and go seek, so donât hide behind the tree.          The key is to make yourself into a shining bright light like the sun if you will. Make it easy for employers to see your benefits, and they will find it much easier to hire you. What is one way you can separate yourself from the crowd and become the first star to shine bright at night?  Let me tell you a secretâ¦       Did you know that fewer than 15% of people who have a career DONâT have a career portfolio. I willing to bet that in your industry itâs way smaller than 10%. What is a career portfolio?       A well-prepared portfolio that provides 'evidence' to an employer of your accomplishments, skills, abilities--it documents the scope and quality of your experience and training in the proper manner.       A career portfolio reveals everything an employer wants to know about you. Remember an employer usually doesnât hire an individual if there are unanswered questions. So you want to make sure tat every question is answered promptly, vividly and clearly.  ======================================================== David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

1.) âProofâ shall set you free!      Put yourself in the shoes of an employer or recruiter for a minute. Looking over hundreds of applicants, they always have a problem. Which is a major problemâ¦they have no idea which individual has the best package to deliver.        Thatâs why there is an interview to choose that one person. Who is the person that gets the job? The individual who show the most âProofâ that they can get the job done.  What shows âProofâ to the highest degree during a job search? Without hesitation itâs a well organized career portfolio.        Employer Moto: You can have the skill and have plenty of experience, but you still have to prove that youâre worthy of the job.    2.) Are you waiting for a Promotion?       A popular question in the job industry is how can I get a promotion or how can I get promoted faster? Here is the simple reply to that questionâ¦      Create a Career Portfolio that exemplifies your skills, experience, and most important accomplishments. Let me ask you a question: Why should you get promoted if you canât at least âshowâ what you have accomplished?      Your reply to this question may be âthey should already know since Iâve been working there for so long.â This is not the case. The bottom line is thisâ¦ companies donât record what you have accomplished. They just evaluate whether youâre doing the job or not.       Your accomplishments probably go way beyond what you have done for the company. And guess whatâ¦your company or association definitely doesnât know about that. So always keep a record of everything that can be tied to your profession.   3.) Are you in need of a raise in salary?      Who wouldnât love to receive a raise? The real question that you need to answer is âWhy should you receive a raise in salary? One of the hardest aspects of a career is getting that raise.       The more value you bring to a company or association, the more you get paid. You can have the skills and experience, but that still doesnât answer the question: Why should I give you a raise?      Here is the solution to getting a raise. You have to prove to the company that you can provide more revenue or value then a normal individual. Just to give you one quick tip on how to distinguish your value from othersâ¦ create a career portfolio and within that portfolio compare your skills to other people who work in your industry.       That way you eliminate the work for the employer. Now they donât have to figure out whether youâre worth a raise because you have already showed them proof of why youâre worth more than the average person. Remember, it all starts with providing the company with more revenue or valueâ¦that is the key.   ======================================================== David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

The person who always gets a good job is relentless and persistent in getting the job. The person who goes an extra mile by doing the unnecessary. Itâs the person who goes above and beyond by doing something different or unique.        We have been playing by the same job search methods for years. But I found out a startling pattern with the people who bend these traditional methods.       The traditional methods are creating a resume, cover letter, or filling out a job application. Is there a law that states that you must not go beyond these methods? Of course not, I recommend that you do more by striving for what you want.        I guarantee that you will get noticed just from being unique. Now Iâm not saying just do anything to get the employer or company attention. You want to think of create of ways that you can show that value that you will provide or the accomplishments and results that you have accomplished in your track record.   Let me give you a few examples that are rarely used:   ** Spice up your resume or cover letter by including a testimonial.        Have a current or past employer give you a testimonial based on your skills and accomplishments. Iâm telling you that this will strike the interest of any one who reads your resume or cover letter.  ** Come in with a plan.       Nothing rocks a companyâs or employerâs boat like a person who comes in with a plan that will increase the company or associationâs revenue or productivity.        Take a moment and brainstorm some ideas that could improve the value of the company you are applying for. It will be well worth your time and effort.      ** Be included within the top 5% by the follow-up.        Yes, about 95% of job seekers usually donât follow up. Remember that companies hardly ever hire a person in just a few days. It takes weeks to fill a position.        So guess who the employer will remember the most when the time comes to hire that one individual. Itâs that person who has multiple exposures. Always remember that our human mind stores much easier from repetitionâ¦so donât be afraid to follow up.  ** You can really crush the competition with a career portfolio.        Yes, it doesnât matter what industry youâre part of, you can create a career portfolio even if you havenât been working for long.        Your portfolio doesnât have to be about how you perceive yourself. You can use the leverage of others to create the ultimate career portfolio so your career can continue to grow and prosper financially over years to come.

I think itâs about time that you tap into the mind of employer to explore their needs and wants. After all they are the individuals who hire you. If you give an employer exactly what they need and want, then you will get the job.   Can I share a secret with you that very few people realize?   You can help control a personâs decision by creating emotion. The kinds of emotions that you want to create in an employer are excitement and curiosity.   Primary Emotions (feelings during finding an employee)   â¢ Boredom: Letâs be honest. Reading hundreds of documents about people you donât know or care about can get very boring, especially when over 90% of rÃ©sumÃ©s are terrible by providing very few benefits if any at all.   â¢ Confusion: Reading hundreds of rÃ©sumÃ©s that arenât equivalent to the position needing to be filled causes confusion.   â¢ Urgency: Employers need help, and that is why they are hiring. They realize that they have a position to fill as soon as possible, and the longer it takes, the more money or productivity will be lost to the company.

Wow, what a nice concert. The Texas A&M small ensemble class was performing some classical pieces and one contemporary classical as I might say today in St. Mary's Catholic Church. I was first bored to death hearing the 'not-so-coherently-played' flutes, clarinets, oboe and stuff played at the beginning of the concert. Just as I was thinking of leaving the concert, well I was also trying to decide whether I'm going to kneel and making a cross sign when I leave or not since I was in the church, but not in a mass, so there I was sitting so everly confused and bored with all those tutty-futty flutes and clarinets. Then just as I build my strength to get up, the music proffesor introduce the last group of ensemble, which is the 'TROMBONE ENSEMBLE'. I was like, WOOOWWW, forget the kneeling, forget me leaving, cause I'm staying..urrgghhh, I'm so boring. Then!!!, this trombone ensemble start to play, man, eight trombone players, set like a whole orchestra with the high, middle, and low arrangement thing. GODD, the play took me back to my junior and high school time. I remember just how fun it was to play my trombone with thw whole brass section....anyway, the last repertoire thay played was a jazz music. Ok, it's jazz and trombone, together, heck, I'm staying till the end of the show. Maybe I should've read the program before the show, anyway, the piece was perfect. I was clapping, without thinking like when I was deciding to kneel or not. Then, I went to talk with one of the trombone player. So then I decided, I'll take the class this summer, however, I still have to look for a slide trombone, since my trombone is a valve kind. Shoot, I wish my birthday was in May.

Two days ago, thesis was done and bound at Kinko's right after leaving from the lab. Then impulsively went to Houston at 11 PM after a bowling game, score 135 (sucks), just to find a restaurant that is still open pass 10 PM, other than IHOP or McD.

A Song     urlLink This song  was created earlier this year. I played the piano in the intro and the solo piano part. When my friends and I recorded this we didn't use a metronome, so the tempo changes are all over the place,hahha, we just recognize this thing when we try to add some more layer on the files without knowing the exact tempo, that was a real headache.
Not the only one    Yesterday was my father's birthday. How do I know it? He sent me an e-mail two days ago stating he will be 53 on July 29th. Then I replied the email by sending an e-card and tried to changed the sending date to two days earlier so to make it looks like I remember his birthday but of course there's no way to do it (what kind of a child am I???) Then I talked to him and he said he even forgot about it himself until my mom called him and remind him that was his birthday. Right there and then I told him I also forgot about it and said 'hah..I'm not the only one who forgot about it.' What a nice kid!!
Tarombo&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Went to St. Mary this Monday cause I haven't been there for about three weeks or more. The theme that day was about honoring grandparents. So at the end of the sermon this new priest I don't even know his name told us to say in our heart the name of our own grandparents. Now I see a problem. I only know my paternal grandmother. I've never met my mother's parents and my father's father. I'm trying really hard to remember any of their names. I remembered my father's grandfather's name, Johannes, which is really rare for an Indonesian name. I think it's because at that time Catholic has become a common religion in the area where my father came from so they started using their baptist name. So I went home while trying hard to remember my grandfather's name. Today, while browsing at my sister's happily neglected web site, I found this Tarombo, which is the family tree from my father's side. So I hurriedly look at the name of my grandfather, I read it and I found it to be another european name, but right next to it his Indonesian name is written in parenthesis, Raja Doli, which is my middle name. Since I came to America, I've never used my middle name anywhere, or just put an initial anytime I need to fill a form requiring my middle name, so it's been five years not hearing people calling me with my middle name, except whenever I meet this Brazilian friend of mine who calls me by my full name everytime we meet. But I hardly ever meet that guy anymore. Now I remember that my father told me when I was a kid that my grandfather gave me his name. I used to ignore that story, but now I see the story in totally different way.
Hah?   I've been getting three emails with the same link http://www.jibjab.com from three different friends from three different countries to see the cartoon about the presidential election stuffs in America. Why is it so popular? I can never understand politic although I know one can never avoid politics. I hope I can use the line from the Casablanca everytime I'm aggravated by any kind of politics, 'Take your politics out of here, I'm trying to run my business.' or something like that, hahahahaha, love that movie.
David Sedaris: the Antonia Vardalos of Best-Selling Author   Growing up, I'm never good with people's name. I used to address all my teachers by the subject they're teaching, Miss Biology, Mister Math and stuff. It's not that I don't respect my teachers, but it's just hard to remember people's name that you don't see at least 12 hours a day. I don't even know the name of those new emerging bands whose songs I like and remember all the lyrics. When somebody told me a joke about how you can get around when you meet an old friend but forgot their name, so you say '..so how do you spell your name' and your old friend would say ' B O B ', and you say ' ahh...I thought there was a hidden M there', I was thinking of using it whenever I meet old friends without having any idea of what their names are. However, there is an exception on this bad habit of mine after I finished reading 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' by David Sedaris. This book is so hilarious that whenever I found myself laughing in the lab while waiting for some experiments, I turn to the first page and read the author's name again 'so what's his name?'. After finish readig the book, I've been rereading the author's name for hundreds of time, hence I can finally remember the author's name. And while reading another book written by this author, I figured out his family has major resemblance to the family in the 'My Big Fat Greek Weeding' movie by Antonia Vardalos. No wonder I like this book a lot.
How did I forget all this?    urlLink    aromatic alkane conformation and stereoisomers naming for chiral carbon  &nbsp; urlLink     As I go through my old notes on organic chemistry, I found an interesting thing in the way I'm thinking. As I remember, when I took the class all I care was to memorize them before I take the exam on the next day, now as I'm rereading the material I'm wondering of how long did it take for Chan, Ingold, and Peng to analyze the chirality of alkane to come up with their stereoisomers naming system and what analysis method did they use to figure out. And also how much research on the thermodynamics and kinetics involved in measuring the stability of one molecule conformation and how do they come up with the idea that the stability of a molecule depends on their conformation.   Ooo, Maroon5 and John Mayer will perform tomorrow in Houston, rgghghhhh too late to buy some (cheap) tickets...rggghhhh.

St. Louis Vs.&nbsp; Chicago Cubs     &nbsp;  Went to Shane's house to watch the game with James, Seungju and Jamie. Shane grilled some german sausage, which really tastes so heavenly with a hint of german beer, I can't remember what the sausages are called. I brought some tiramisu I made yesterday with the wrong type of cheese.&nbsp; ( I used ricotta instead of mascarpone) but it still taste good, or so they said.&nbsp;Turned out Sara loves tiramisu a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then went home and finally something motivated me to open that storage door to dig my organic, physical and analytical chemistry old stuffs. I need to brush up on these subjects before the Chemistry PhD orientation next month. Dialkyl-ether-dendrimer-aromatic-eigenvalue-wavefunction*&amp;%^$ crap here I come!!!
Webcamchat    &nbsp; Yayang introduced me to MSN chatting with webcam on after a couple of line saying his and how are yous to each other with the usual chatting mode. Well, they say picture paints a thousand word, and the monitor shows at least 24 frames of pictures per second so that it is viewable to human eyes. 24 times 1000 times whatever seconds you spend webcamchatting, I guess that's a more effective way to express yourself. So these pics show how I express myself to her for about ten minutes. It feels good if you can still make fun of yourself.

Do people live in one place anymore?    &nbsp; Got up at 11 in the morning, Erik called, he is moving to Austin so I helped him with the moving frenzy. Drove to Austin in a U-Haul. One of the tires on Erik's car exploded in the Bastrop area. Got back to College Station, went to Revolution for Inok's farewell night. Too muddy and hot, music was not that enjoyable. Then went to IHOP, found it not really crowded, that's good. Yupe, it's the time of the semester that people say goodbyes to old friends and hellos to new friends. I wish all the lucks to all my friends who's leaving to places for the new beginning of their careers and lifes. 'WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE COLLEGE STATION',&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know.
Come on now!    &nbsp; Now the  urlLink she's  facing a five-months jail time, who is going to teach us how to collect the honey from the beehives in our own backyard, or how to make a perfect omelette using the eggs of your own home-raised chicken or even how to make and decorate your own five layer wedding cake? I guess the people in one of the&nbsp;federal jail will get a good deal of interior design make over and better things to eat for five months. They're so lucky.
I named it 'It's Thursday and I'm Hungry' entree,     &nbsp;   Preparation  : 5 minutes  &nbsp;   Cooking  : 15 minutes  &nbsp;   Enjoying  : Inverse relation with hungriness  &nbsp;    How to  :&nbsp;    Sautee some sliced pepperonis or any other type of meat that has good fat content so that once they're sauteed up they will release oils with nice flavor  Cover some shrimps, amount undecided, with olive oil, garlic powder, pepper, salt, nutmeg, soy, and any other marinating liquid you might feel like to use but&nbsp;don't peel&nbsp;the shrimp&nbsp;cause all the flavor&nbsp;are in the skin.  Once the peps and shrimps look happy (bam!) add some green bellpepper and some vegetable ( those with lots of leaves types of vegetable), after chopping them into bite sizes.  Beat two eggs together and put into the pep, shrimp, bellpepper and vegetable mix. Add some more seasoning if you like. If you have limes, squeeze half of the lime to get the juice right on top of the sauteeing stuffs, just to give a bit of a kick!  Look around in your fridge, if you have some cheese (laughing cow cheese is the best) throw some of them into the pan just before you turn the heat off so they melt beautifully.  In another pan, steam some baby carrot. (have this thing steaming at the beginning of the step)  To serve, get a bowl, put some of the steamed baby carrot (without the steaming water),&nbsp;amount undecided, and on top of them put the sauteed pep, shrimp, bellpepper, vegetable and egg from&nbsp;the other pan.  Optional: For crispiness, if you have any tortilla&nbsp;somewhere&nbsp;in your fridge, broil them in the oven at 400 F for about 5 minutes or until they're really crispy. Do this sometimes before you finish sauteeing the meats and vegetable.  Pop up&nbsp;a bottle of beer or get a glass of wine or milk or water, turn off the heat in the stove and the oven, find your TV remote, turn to FoodTV Channel and start eating while watching one of those masters cooking their own food.     I'm telling you, you can almost&nbsp;taste what they're cooking if you have something to eat while you're watching one of those shows.  Now if I can just make a desser to be named &nbsp;'Can I&nbsp;Have&nbsp;Two Cups of &nbsp;Sugaah, Baby'.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
The 6th Floor   Last month somebody in the 6th floor of Richardson killed himself. My lab is in the 9th floor, which means everyday I passed the 6th floor using the elevator. Since I'm a chemical engineering student, while most of the people in Richardson are petroleum student, I don't know what really happened to the guy. Last night around 10 PM, I dropped by the lab to get some samples to do SEM on and left the lab around 11 PM. When I got into the elevator I looked at the digits indicating the floor you're passing on the elevator door. Somehow, I started to think about the incident as I watch the digits changing and it has been a habit for me to count the floors all the way to where I'm going. So it went from 9, 8, 7 and then it stopped at 6. I waited as the elevator door slided open. I think I kind of close my eyes halfway and try to blur my vision so that I won't really absorbed the spookiness or any specter flying around, I know I felt really stupid. Than the door opened perfectly and a man came in. His feet touched the floor. I was like, pheew....hahaha. I asked him if he knew anything about the news, he said yes. He said all the people in that floor try not to go into the room used to be the guy's office. It's just a sad news for people to chose to stop their live for whatever reason. I know there are a lot of obstacles, pressures and other problems people encounter and we sure will in this life, but there should be some options, even just one option, for people to chose other than killing themselves to lessen the burden they're having.

Lazy Day   After not doing anything the whole morning and afternoon, except eating, checking the roses in the backyard and more eating, I decided to go for a swim at 8:30. Then I decided to drop by the lab to check something and found Dan in the lab. Than chatted about the politics in the academia, man I thought politics is just for the government. I guess I thought wrong.

Procrastinatus ,  meaning pro: forward, crastinus: tomorrow (or some other time in my case)   I've been meaining to use the BET machine since last two weeks, however it was always used and a week ago it broke down, so I keep putting the experiment off for quite a while now. So now I'm waiting for Shane to come back from Germany to take a look at the machine. Until then, I can procrastinate on my experiment with a valid reason, huahuahuahua.   Today I felt like a dependable master student, hahaha, the feeling that I haven't felt lately, right after I defended my thesis. I had a good doze of X-Ray Diffraction discussion with John. I think I helped a bit and gave some comments from my research experience. Now that's what I called a good learning experience. Anyway, I think I'll head to rec center for a couple of laps in the pool and the running track, now that Dan is off to somewhere, weeeeeeee!!

Low-Carb Madness   Has anybody noticed that almost all restaurant now have a special menu for the low-carb dieters, which for some of them it means taking the buns off the burger and keep the price unchanged. I guess it's like a fashion trend, this year it's the carbohydrate, next year it's fat, depends on any dietrician who comes up with a bestselling book on how to lost your weight. Anywayyyy, I tried the C2 coke today, or as I like to call it a- diluted-coke-with-an-equal-molar-of-water-added-into-the-regular-cola kinda drink. I guess now people won't fell guilty if they drink two can of C2 cokes at a time since that will be equal to one can of regular soda. What a great tactic to sell more sodas, I admire those marketing people,huahuhuahuahua.  Songs stuck in head: Heaven by Los Lonely Boys and Love's Divine by Seal. I've been trying to look for the CDs everywhere, well mainly in half price book store (being a poor graduate student :) ), and still I can't find it. Right now I'll just wait until one of the radio stations play the songs. Yesterday the song started playing as I parked my car. I just sit in the car until the song ended right in the parking lot. I do that a lot, hahahaha. Sometimes I wonder if that count as craziness.  Off to the lab... again!!
I took this picture from a plantation house located right in the middle of Baton Rouge and New Orleans. This is the free standing stairs of the house.

New Orleans Trip,  WOW great weekend getaway. A view of the Mississippi river, a long island ice tea in the bourbon street and a nice plate (O.K. two plates) of beignet in Cafe du Monde. Happy 4th of July!! More on the story later.
I Had a Dream    After coming home from Houston last night, I was starving. I didn't have a chance to take my dinner before we went off to Houston. During the game I didn't buy any food in the stadium. Jamie brought a plastic bag full of candies that keeps all of us happy during the game (it's kinda slow for me and there only was one homerun by the Astros and they switch the pitcher, Clemens, in the middle of the game, but still it's interesting)So yesterday I just ate four candies, drank a bottle of milk and a bagel for lunch and one plate of egg salad after I got home. So I was pretty much starvig when I went to bed. Whenever I feel hungry while I'm sleeping, I always dream about eating some foods and wake up feeling even hungrier. Last night was kinda a different dream. I dream of eating my home country food with my family and I started eating the food with silverwear but after a while I use my hand to eat the food instead of the silverwear, and it felt really good. I guess I was hungry and homesick at the same time. The good thing is I'll get to visit my home country this fall, yeeee...great foods.
Astro Vs. Braves   Just got back from Minute Maid stadium in Downtown Houston to watch the baseball game with the whole office group minus Henry and John. T'was really fun. Luke Wilson was there...hahahaha. Plane trip tomorrow, can't wait!

Within the next month, I plan on registering two different domains and creating websites for each. One website will be for the Computer Science Club that I'll be co-president of next year (Current site:  urlLink http://hpcompsciclub.tripod.com/ ); the other site will be for the Final Fantasy XI clan that I've become a co-leader of (Current site:  urlLink http://foxknights.tripod.com/ ). I designed both of the current sites, but I want to be able to do things that free hosts won't allow (PHP scripting, custom email addresses, etc.). Maybe I'll even migrate this blog to a subdomain to one of them to make image hosting easier.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to do a bunch of the things that I want to do with the websites. That's the stuff I'll be learning in Indeoendent Study this next year, but until then, neither are going to be all that different from what they look like right now. Maybe I'll start learning a few things before school starts; it'd at least give me something to do when I get bored.
Yeah, I went to go see that movie on Friday, and ironcially I'm making this blog entry 'the day after tomorrow' from the POV of it being Friday. I know it sounds stupid, shut up. It was a good movie, and one that I'll probably be adding to my DVD collection (along with the 3 others I've seen so far this summer).  The day after tomorrow is also when I start summer school. That goes until the 18th from 7:30 to 12:45 every day, but I get credit for an entire semester course (Speech), so I'm not complaining. At least I don't have baseball to worry about this week in addition to summer school.
Apparently our series with Kilgore was only a one game series instead of a best of 3. We lost last night 4-3, so that ends our season for this year. And if that wasn't bad enough, our bus broke down while we were there. Luckily it didn't take that long for a replacement one to arrive, and I was home a little after midnight. Time to go to sleep now.
Yep, that's what MapQuest says for the time to get from Dallas to Sulphur Springs. Now, if we lay out the rest of the day on a timeline, I can't quite figure out why we're leaving so early:  3:00 - Bus leaves HP 4:30 - Bus arrives in Sulphur Springs 7:30 - Game Starts 9:30 - Game ends/Bus leaves Sulphur Springs 11:00-11:30 - Bus arrives at HP  I do have to question the three hour gap in between us arriving there and the start of the game. We need 1 hour to warm up, so I could understand 90 minutes to 2 hours. But 3?? Hope I can find a way to entertain myself; I'll be needing one.
Coach Gibbins called my house today while I was out seeing  Shrek 2  (which is just as good, if not better, than the first). We play tomorrow in Sulphur Springs @ 7:30 PM, but the but leaves at 3:00. That means I have to be up at the school between 2:15 and 2:30 to get everything ready. This sounds like I might be the only student trainer at the game tomorrow...  If Wes is no longer going to be the Varsity trainer (and I'm therefore the only one), it'll be interesting to see how games after this week are handled. If we win this series, we'll have games on days that I'm in summer school. Games that are after 1:10 (or that I have to leave for after that time) won't be a problem, but I don't know how State will work if we go that far since I doubt I can miss (at least) 2 days of summer school to go to wherever those games will be played. Oh well, I guess we'll just see how it works out.
I know everyone loves to be out of school, but it can get extremely boring sometimes when there's nothing for you to do. Wait, let me rephrase that -- when there's nothing that you  want  to do. I have tons of games downstairs that I could (and probably need to) play, but I just don't really want to right now.  I know that I didn't post yesterday, mainly because nothing all that eventful ever happens on a Sunday. My day pretty much consisted of going to church, eating lunch, and playing FFXI. Not all that interesting to talk about.  Granted, today hasn't been much more interesting. Wake up, go eat lunch, and then come home and post this. Yeah, that's been about it. Now it's time to go try and find something to entertain myself...
We won the series against McKinney (10-0 on Thursday at the game I missed, and 8-1 today), so this next week we'll play Kilgore. No clue where that is (except that it's somewhere in Texas), but apparently it takes a while to get there. From what I've heard, the games will either be here, Kilgore, Tyler, or some combination of those places. Coach Gibbins said that he'd call me this next week and let me know the times and places of the games (hopefully the times for the bus, also). If we keep advancing, the State Finals are the 10th and 11th of June.  Apparently putting eye black on me is now good luck for the team. Before the game, someone pointed out that they won the last game they put it on me, and now they're 2/2. It doesn't really bother me -- I just have to remember not to wipe my face.  This might be the last week that I'm able to work the playoff games since I start summer school 1 week from Tuesday. I didn't want to have to take Speech next year, so my only other option was to take it during the summer. 3 weeks vs. 18 weeks?? I think I'll take the 3...
And for the record,  yes , I did miss the bus yesterday. I got there at 5:00, and they decided that it would be a good idea to leave between 4:45 and 5:00. Oh well, at least I didn't get in trouble for it (or haven't to this point anyway). From what I heard, we apparently won last night so there will only be the 4:00 game tomorrow unless we lose.  Went and saw  Troy  today after school -- pretty good movie, even though it did border on being a bit too long for me. Next up:  Shrek 2  sometime near the beginning of next week.  Angela claims that she's having a night swim party at her house on Saturday or Sunday (although it's most likely Sunday) for 'all of us' -- I assume this means our U.S. History class. She said that she would call me with the time, so I guess I'll see if she actually meant it or not sometime tomorrow.
Yeah, I know...Well, I  meant  to update this daily. Guess (at least over the past few days) it hasn't been as daily as the title says...  2 exams down, none to go :) -- All I have to do from today (actually yesterday) until tomorrow is just show up at school for any periods that I have a class. No exams, but we have to be there for attendance purposes. Today I have my Computer Science AP class; I think we're watching  Harry Potter and CoS  for the two hour exam period. At least I'm taking my Xbox and that DVD up to the school with that intent. My guess is that 5 kids out of our class will show up. Granted, that's an extremely high percentage when we only have a little over 10 anyway, but we'll see.  Another baseball game tonight, and no one thinks it is important enough to tell the trainer when it's time for the bus to leave. 5:00? 5:30? 4:00? I've been told all those times, all by different people. My guess is somewhere between 5:00-5:30, so that's when I'm showing up. If the bus is gone and I get in trouble for it, it's not like there was ever a consensus on when I was supposed to show up. If I do end up going, it will be close to 11:00 before I get home (game ends ~9:30, 1 hour drive home, then cleaning up the stuff and actually driving to my house).  Well, I guess that's about it. Time to entertain myself for about an hour and a half and then leave to go up to the school.
Really, tomorrow is my only hard day of exams. Here's our school's schedule:   Tuesday:  1st Period Exam - U.S. History Periods 3-6 2nd Period Exam - PreCal PAP TAG   Wednesday:  7th Period Exam - English AP (no exam in any AP class, but we still have to show up) Periods 3-6 3rd Period Exam - Physics AP (except I have to do Computer Science AP late testing at this time)   Thursday:  5th Period Exam - Spanish AP 6th Period Exam - Computer Science AP   Friday:  4th Period Exam - Theater Arts (long term project turned in today) 8th Period Exam - Lunch   Varsity Baseball plays this week on Thursday @ 7:30 and Saturday @ 4:00. I'll be working both those games (and the third, if necessary). Apparently no one thinks I'm going to be a trainer for Varsity Football next year (which I  am ), so a bunch of people got happy about that when I told them. We also have a picture for that during the 8th Period Exam on Friday -- good thing I rearranged my schedule to have lunch then.
For anyone that read my blog before this post, it used to be at  urlLink http://dailygoob.blogspot.com/  -- Now, in order to be able to post images, the address is  urlLink http://dailygoob.tripod.com/   Only the Tripod site will be updated from now on, so don't bother visiting the BlogSpot one.
Starting Tuesday we have exams, so I've been having to do exam reviews all weekend. I did do more than just that over the past 2 days though.   Friday:  Right after school, we had to finish filming our Theater Arts movie over at Highlander Stadium. There was a slight miscommunication between the athletic director and myself, so I almost had to sign a 1 million dollar liability waiver. Good thing Mr. Martin and Ms. Boyer help me take care of that issue. While I'm not going to name anyone specifically, there's one person that in my group that I honestly hope I never have to see again after this school year. Enough on that.  We also had our 2nd playoff game against Hillcrest on Friday. J.T. had a little bit of fun with me right before the game started, so I took a picture when I got home, and I'll put it up here. We won something like 12 or 13 to 1, so we play against someone else this next week. Not sure who, where, or if I'll even do it since it will be in the middle of exams.  Edit: Here's the picture of what J.T. did to me at the baseball game on Friday. I got quite a few comments about it...       Saturday:  Started working on my U.S. History exam review (since I'm not in AP). Mid-morning I left to go help someone get their DSL hooked up, but I couldn't do any more than just get all the hardware set up since DSL won't be activated until the 19th. Guess I know where I'll be going after exams one day...  I was gone the majority of the afternoon because I went to go see Van Helsing with my grandmother. I thought it was a pretty good movie; I liked it about as much as I did the first X-Men. Here's the list of the other movies that we're going to see this summer:     -Troy    -Shrek 2    -The Day after Tomorrow    -Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban    -The Chronicles of Riddick    -I, Robot    -The Bourne Supremacy    -King Arthur    -The Village  Nothing big happened last night, I just played a little FFXI and created this blog. Then went to sleep as my away message normally says.    Sunday:  Hmmmm....To-Do list for today:     -Finish U.S. History Exam Review    -Change script for Theater Arts movie    -Finish reading  Grapes of Wrath     -Upload picture from baseball and add it to this post    -Get movie clip to Andrew  And, yeah...that's about it. I need to read the Blogger help file this afternoon for uploading/linking pictures. Pretty sure it's the same as normal HTML (the rest of this markup is), but I just want to make sure.
Why did I remember that I had a Blogger account from  2 or 3 years ago all of a sudden? Not really sure...but might as well use it since I'm bored right now.  For anyone that's reading this and doesn't know who I am, I'm not entirely sure why you're here, but feel free to keep reading. My name is Jeff Guebert (my last name is where the title of my blog comes from, courtesy of one of my friends about 10 years ago), I'm 17, and I live in Dallas. There, you know me now.  I'll probably get around to writing a more interesting (and longer) post tomorrow. For now, though, it's time to go to sleep...
For quite a while the internet has been available wirelessly at locations known as 'hotspots' which can be found in places like Starbucks, McDonalds, and airports. GPRS and EDGE have allowed people to get on the internet anywhere that they can get a digital cellphone connection. Take the availability of cellphone networks, replace the necessity for a cellphone with a wireless card (much like 802.11a/b/g), and up the speed to almost twice that of a T3 connection:   that's  802.16 .  This isn't the only new technology that's competing to be the next thing home users will use for their internet connection, but with speeds and convenience on this level, whatever technology end up becoming widely adopted will take the internet to a whole new level.
I go through these phases of researching different areas in technology in depth so that a) I can explain it to people if they ever ask me about it, and b) I can make a stronger argument for getting that technology in our house. :)  Anyway, the latest of these research sprees I've gone on has been Bluetooth. I remember about 1-2 years ago when this technology was first starting to be advertised by manufacturers, but one of the major problems then was that products made by two different companies were not guaranteed to (and often didn't) work with each other. Just another example of why I think standards are one of the best things that can happen in the tech industry.  The uses for Bluetooth are very impressive even though it is only considered a 'wire replacement'. Have a laptop and cell phone both enabled with Bluetooth? Instant wireless modem via either GPRS or EDGE. Bluetooth headset? Acts as a speaker on pretty much anything that makes sound.  More and more products on the market are staring to incorporate Bluetooth, and I wouldn't be surprised if eventually every single peripheral is completely wireless via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or some other wireless standard.
Aka,  How to Make my Life Miserable . So, want to know the secret?  Subway. No, I'm not kidding. I had Subway for lunch on Monday, and Thursday was the first time I could manage to even look at my computer monitor since then. I'm still not completely better (although I can eat pretty much whatever I want to now), and every once in a while I'll have issues walking straight or standing up since I'm still a little dizzy. Oh well, at least it's better than spending over 2 full days doing nothing but lying in my bed. Summer and I really need to have a talk about what I'm supposed to be able to do and how I'm supposed to feel (Hint: This isn't one of them).
Yep, I'm done with all 14 days of summer school now and (hopefully) have credit for Communication Applications (Speech) now. Nothing left for me to do this summer except sleep, play video games, and go watch movies. Oh yeah, and hopefully be able to update this more often than once per week.
3 speeches in a week should not be allowed. But unfortunately it is, so that took up the majority of my time this past week. Friday I saw  The Chronicles of Riddick  (which surprised me by being a pretty good movie, more on that tomorrow) and worked on my grandparents' computer. Then I had to take the ACT yesterday, go work on 2 different people's computers, and then today I went back to my grandparents to show them how to use the computer after I made the changes to it on Friday. Tomorrow I begin my last week of summer school (which hopefully won't involve a lot of speeches). Life? Lighten up a little.....please.
Yeah, been a few days since I updated. Lots of stuff going on, though. Anyway, let me think about what's happened...  Yesterday I had to give my speech over HDTV. I think it went pretty will; everyone seemed to enjoy it, and someone in my class even told another one of my friends how good it was. I get to give another one tomorrow over King Tut which has to make use of a visual aid. Hopefully that one will go just as well.  Tonight I tried to log into Star Wars Galaxies to play (even though I don't particularly like the game and enjoy playing FFXI much more), but I ran into an interesting problem. Somehow my account has been cancelled, and I know that I'm not the one that did it. My only guess is that Sony cancelled it after an inactivity period (of what, 3 weeks??), so they got an email from me tonight asking them to 'un-cancel' it. There's probably not a great chance that I'd be renewing my account anyway once my current subscription expires, but if I have to jump through hoops to get my account activated again, there's no way that I'm going to be playing this game that much longer.  Oh yeah, and there's been way too much rain here recently. Make it stop!!
Yep, this is been a '1,2,3' weekend for me (as indicated by the topic title). Now for some more in depth discussion of each of these things:   1 Week of Summer School Down:  Friday marked the end of my first week of summer school (and the equivalent of the end of the 1st 6 Weeks). My first real speech is on Monday, so I have to finish preparing for it over the weekend. It has to be an informative speech with no visual aid, so I decided to do it over HDTVs. My second one will be on Wednesday which is an informative speeck with a visual aid, and I think I'll do that one on either the Egyptian Pyramids or the Sphinx.   2 SAT II Tests:  Today I took my first two SAT II tests, Writing and Mat IIC. I could have done a third, but I didn't feel like doing Spanish and there was no way I was going to do Physics. I'll probably do 1 or 2 more at the start of next school year.   3 for 3 on HP Movies:   Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban  definitely gets two thumbs up from me. It left out quite a bit that was in the book, but since most everyone that is going to see the movies has already read the book, the stuff they left out was fine. I don't know if I would say it was better than the second one (Chamber of Secrets), but there's no way it was worse.  That about covers my weekend so far. Nothing big planned for tomorrow except for working on my speeches, but who knows what could pop up at the last moment.
So, I get out of summer school today to go eat lunch. Wendy's, long line; Whataburger, long line; Chick-Fil-A,  extremely  long line; McDonald's, 4 cars? Maybe they're having problems due to the massive power outages we've been having, but I went over there since I figured I could get my food faster.   Yeah, it went faster, but I was very impressed by the system they have set up. Instead of using the normal speaker, there were 2 women standing outside with PDAs in their hands. 2 cars at a time would give their order, and it would be transmitted wirelessly into the kitchen. Then, they had a manager with a money belt standing near the first window so that both cars could pay at the same time. Then, each of the cars head to the second window to get their food right as the next set of cars is coming around. No wonder there's no line, even Chick-Fil-A's dual lane system doesn't work as well (or else they're about 100x as popular).  Still, the point remains that I think this is an awesome use of technology and that more restaurants should make use of features like this. Not just fast food, but also places like Chili's and other sit-down restaurants. Waiter is ready to take your order? He sends it back to the kitchen to speed up the process. Need a refill on that drink? Give something to the customers so that they can signal when they need one. If restaurants started to embrace technology with ideas like this, I'd gladly pay a few extra dollars each time I went there to help support the costs. 10 years from now, no telling how we'll be getting our food, but I can assure you that it will rely on technology much more than it does now.
Yeah, so 18 hours with electricity is the best way to spend the first part of summer in Texas, right? RIGHT?? Actually, that would be a 'no'. We had a huge thunderstorm cell come straight through the Dallas area last night (while I was out seeing  Miss Saigon ) which knocked out our power until 4:00 this afternoon.  2 days of summer school down, and the class is turing out to be fairly entertaining. Our teacher makes lots of jokes and tells us stories, so it doesn't seem like we're really there for 5 hours and 15 minutes. We start giving our first speeches tomorrow, though, but hopefully this trend will hold...
Wow..........strange (and bad) movie. I won't spoil it for any of you who actually think you want to go see it, but trust me, it's not worth the $6 or $7 dollars to get a ticket. Actually, it's the only movie this summer that I've seen which I won't be getting on DVD when it comes out as a result of me hating the movie (see my note next to  The Terminal ):    Van Helsing  Troy  Shrek 2  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  The Day After Tomorrow  The Terminal (Won't be getting on DVD since it's not a movie I'd watch all that often, but it was still good)  Spiderman 2  King Arthur  I, Robot  The Bourne Supremacy  Catwoman   About time to eat lunch and then I'm going back to CPL for a few hours. They better not be showing  The Village  there....
That's kinda how yesterday felt  :)  After my friend and I got to the hotel 30 minutes later than I originally planned, we figured that registration would already be going on. It was a good guess if they had actually bothered to follow their schedule. The registration tables didn't even open up for another hour and 30 minutes, then we stood in Line #1 for about 40 minutes, got our nametage, then stood in Line #2 for about 30 minutes more. Note to CPL staff: A schedule is something you're supposed to follow, not just create and then conveniently forget.  I'm probably going back again on Saturday for at least part of the day (maybe not all, there's only so much I can actually do). Tommorow, I have  The Village  to go see, and I'll post my thoughts on that when I get home.
I've had this DVD for over a year, but never got around to watching it until last night (well, technically early&nbsp;this morning). While it's probably not going to be a movie that I watch as often as some of my others ( Galaxyquest ,  The Mummy (Returns) , etc.), this has to have been one of the best non-action and saddest movies that I've seen in a very long time. If you haven't seen it (and you can manage to sit through something where stuff doesn't blow up every 5 seconds) definitely go out and rent it.  CPL starts today, so expect my post tomorrow to deal with my experiences that I have there.
The numbers don't stand for quite the same things that they did the first time though. This time, it's 1 DDR Party, 2 FFXI Websites, and 3 Extremely Good Movies.   1 DDR Party:  Tuesday night Sam had a DDR party over at his house. While only a few of us actually had prior experience playing, it was fun, and a bunch of people made the comment that they wanted to go out and buy it. It did strike me as being a little humorous when people aske me if this was just a normal DVD. Not sure how you would connect the pads then...   2 FFXI Websites:  The site I am designing for my FFXI clan finally went online on its new paid hosting, and I have also been recruited as the lead person for the FFXI division of another website. Not exactly what I would call the best timing to have both of these come up together, but it'll at least keep me busy for a while.   3 Extremely Good Movies:  I saw 3 movies this week:  I, Robot ,  The Bourne Supremacy , and  Catwoman . I liked all of these movies a whole lot, and definitely recommend that anyone reading this should go see them.  I, Robot  was a very entertaining cdi-fi/mystery movie,  The Bourne Supremacy  was an extremely good sequel (although I suggest seeing  The Bourne Identity  first), and  Catwoman  rivals  Spiderman 2  as being one of the best superhero(ine) movies I've ever seen.  Going along with the number 3, that's how many people called my house within 45 minutes wanting an answer to the exact same question. Not a whole lot of cross-communication going on there...
Yesterday marked the one month point until we have to go back to school (August 16th). Every summer I always say that I'm going to do a whole lot of stuff, but (as expected) I maybe get about 1/10 of it done. Still in the middle of reading my two books for summer reading which hopefully I can get finished up by the week prior to school starting so I have a few days to review each of them. Anyone that knows me knows that reading comprehension isn't exactly an area where I excel in. Plot summary? Yes. Characters? Kinda. Style analysis and what the deeper meaning of lines 5-23 are? No. &nbsp; For the past 4 nights (Tuesday-Friday), we've had Vacation Bible School at our church. Since my grandparents are the ministers, I of course get to help with  everything  that we do (food, singing, crafts, etc.). At least that's over with and I hold the unofficial veto power for any and all future years. &nbsp;  Ratchet and Clank  (the first one, not  Going Commando ) is my new favorite game. I'm about 2/3 to 3/4 done with it already, and next up on my list is the sequel. I'm trying to play and beat&nbsp;games that have sequels (or simply more games coming out in the series) coming out this fall ( R&amp;C: Up Your Arsenal ,  Sly 2: Band of Thieves ,  Jak 3 , etc.) before the sequels come out. Then not to mention great games such as  Beyond Good and Evil ,  Metal Arms: Glitch in the System , and  Prince of Persia  that I still need to play. I wonder if 1 month if even enough...
Sam wanted me to make sure that I mentioned that he and Stephaine Holford were over at my house on Tuesday. Sam and I were supposed to be working on the Computer Science Club website,&nbsp; but all we really did was play DDR for about 1-2 hours. So Sam (and Stephanie), here's your 'shout out' that you wanted on my blog&nbsp; :).
Hope that anyone who bothers to read this had a great 4th of July weekend and did lots of fun stuff. We didn't go anywhere like we normally do since tonight we are going to see the second musical that we have tickets to,  The King and I .  Since Saturday evening, I have been downloading episodes from two of my favorite comedies on Fox. The first one,  urlLink  Quintuplets  , just premiered a few weeks ago, but has already become one of the shows that I try to watch every week. The other show,  urlLink  Arrested Development  , has completed its first season and is going to start its second in the fall. Both of these shows are part of Fox's LOL Sunday lineup, so it makes them easy to watch along with  Malcolm .
The past two days have been pretty boring for me. Next week is a completely different story, though. If you're going to read this post, however, you get a run down of the boring past two days, not the exciting future week.  Yesterday I played FFXI....lots. Almost gained an entire level (really 2, but I had so little XP left to go for the first one that I'm not counting it) by fighting in Batallia Downs. Kazham needs to go die and take all of its evil Gobs with it. Also started the first Splinter Cell on Xbox (again, I have this habit of restarting games that I'm not all that far in if I haven't played them in ages) last night, but I'm still on the first level. So much for trying to diminish my backlog of games this summer.  Today was a little more active, but not by much. I went out to lunch at Cici's Pizza and then came home and started playing SWG. Not really sure how I've done comparatively in SWG today to FFXI yesterday, but I've still made progress. I also explained to my parents about upgrading their cellphones to GSM (I'm the only one with that right now), but I still need to get them to go to Cingular and actually do the upgrade.  Yeah, that's it. Sad, huh??
Since there were no big movies that came out today that I wanted to see (although I probably will rent  Collateral  when it comes out on DVD), the movie that made today's cut was  The Manchurian Candidate.  Well, the reviews were definitely right on this one; it was an extremely good movie and a welcome change from last week. If you've seen the original (I haven't), it supposedly changes quite a bit of stuff up (such as who is running for office, etc.). No complaints from me though, and it's definitely one of my recommended movies of the summer.
Two words, or rather a word and a number:  Doom. 3.  Wow....yeah, that's probably the best word to describe it. Even though I don't have the most powerful computer in the world (P4 2.0, 768 RAM, GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128 MB video card), this game  still  looks incredible. And even though it's not going to scare the living daylights out of you every 3 seconds (well, it might at harder difficulty levels; I'm playing on the easiest setting and only at the very beginning of the 4th 'mission'), this is a much better source for being scared than that pathetic excuse for a movie in general called  The Village.
âMummy, Daddy, wake up! Weâre going to the beach today, remember?!â Jonah shook his parents by their shoulders. Daddy stirred from his sleep and leaned over to the side table to reach for the clock.  âJonah, itâs only 5.30 a.m, son. Itâs too early,â Daddy replied groggily.  âBut Daddy, I want to see the sunrise,â Jonah whined. He continued to shake his Mummy.  âJonah? Whatâs wrong darling?â Mummy asked him sleepily with one eye opened.  âI want to go to the beach now Mummy. I want to catch the sunrise.â Jonah urged Mummy to wake up.  âOh, alright then. Wait downstairs and let Mummy and Daddy change before we stroll through the beach,â Mummy replied as she pushed Daddy off the bed and signaled him to bathe. Jonah excitedly got off the bed and ran downstairs.   He had always loved the sunrise and today he had wanted to catch the sun rising across the waters. Though the drive from his house to the beach was short, he still wanted them to arrive slightly earlier. He waited as patiently as he could and got out the cereal box to eat his breakfast calmly. Just as he was about to finish, he heard his parents coming down the stairs. Like a bolt of lightning, he went to his parents and pulled them to the front door.  âLetâs go Mummy, Daddy.â He urged them.  âJonah, we havenât even have our breakfast,â Mummy scolded him gently.  âNevermind Julia. Weâll have our breakfast later,â Daddy replied laughingly. So the trio went out of the door and went to their driveway. It was still dark but Jonah was used to the darkness â so were his parents. Jonah climbed on the seat quickly and rushed his parents to move faster. Seconds later, they were driving through the lane which led to the beach.   When they reached, Jonah left his parentsâ side and straightaway climbed on a large rock facing the sea. He huddled himself together and felt the morning breeze blowing gently across his face. He checked his watch and realized that after all the commotion, it was only 5.45am. He turned his head when Daddy called him.  âJonah, your mum and I will be getting our breakfast. You wait here alright? Weâll get you your breakfast too.â Nodding his head, he turned back to watch the sea. He was used to being left alone on the beach to catch sunrise while his parents went away. They had taught him to be independent though he was only eleven. He smelled the crisp air of Oklahoma and felt free. He loved the beach so much that his parents actually bought the house so that he could frequent the beach.   When a tinge of orange crept into the darkness, Jonah kept his eyes on it. Slowly, as if playing hide-and-seek, the glowing sun peeped from behind the sea. The warmth of the sun spread through the beach and pierced through the cold morning breeze, engulfing Jonah with its warmth. Jonah breathed in a fresh of fresh air and pampered himself with the feeling of being engulfed. He saw a few other people strolling together, mostly couples, hand in hand. Laying his head on his arm, he waited for his parents to come with his breakfast and they will be able to stroll the beach together.  But they never came back. Jonah waited and waited but there was no sign of them. It was his uncle who came to pick him up.  âJonah? Come here, son,â his uncleâs voice rang out and he felt two hands taking his shoulder. He was then embraced by his uncle. He was puzzled as to why his uncle came instead of his parents and why there were tears in his uncleâs eyes. He was also bewildered as to why his uncle was hugging him tightly. What happened?   Jonah still remembered how curious he felt to see his relatives crying. Never have he seen his uncles cry though he had seen his aunties cry. His uncle Johnny led him into a room and he saw two beds occupied but the person on each bed were covered with blanket all the way over their heads. Jonah became puzzled as to why Uncle Johnny showed them to him. He was not afraid of ghost or anything. Was this another prank?   But when Uncle Johnny brought him closer to the beds, he felt his hair stand and his heart felt heavy.  âWhat is going on Uncle John?â Jonah asked curiously as he looked up to look at Uncle John. Uncle John only stifled a cry before lifting the covers. He felt the ground swayed when he saw his Daddy and Mummy, pale-face, lying on each bed.  âMummy? Daddy? Wake up. Why are you sleeping?â Jonah asked furiously. He refused to believe or even think that his parents wereâ¦ not coming back.  âWake up! You promised to buy me breakfast remember?' Jonah all but shouted.  âWake up please Mummy, Daddy. Please donât leave me all alone,â Jonah finally cried as he hugged his parentsâ lifeless body.  âPlease donât leave me all alone here. I donât want to be alone.â
15 years had passed since his parents died but at 26 now, he could still remember the tragedy like as if it was yesterday. His parentsâ were killed at a car crashed. They crashed with a drunkard who was driving in a drunken stupor. Life had been hard after that. He still remembered asking for his parents sometimes when he had nightmares at night. But it was always his Uncle John who stood by him. It was also thanks to him that he received proper education and lifestyle. He really owned that old man a lot.   Now that he was a successful shop owner,selling books, he moved out of Uncle Johnâs apartment and bought one of his own. Occasionally he would visit Uncle John, like today. He needed company sometimes. He's an old bachelor.  âUncle John? Where are you?â Jonah called out when he was at the porch.  âJonah? Here! Backyard young man!â Uncle John shouted. Knowingly, Jonah went to the backyard and saw the dear old man standing under the redbud tree where mistletoes grew from. His Uncle John loves to plant plants.  'Atleast that will keep his mind off about getting me married,' Jonah thought to himself. Jonah hurried to Uncle John and pecked his cheek.  'Glad that oyu could come Jonah. I was getting bored being here alone. Though there is company, just next door. A new neighbour, sexy as hell, Jonah.' Uncle john smirked. Shaking his head, Jonah sat down under the tree with Uncle John.  'So how have you been ,Jonah?' Uncle John asked, getting serious. Jonah could only shrug his shoulders. He couldn't tell Uncle John that he still had nightmares. He decided that it was best to keep quiet. The two kept quiet as they gaze across the lawn. Due to the weekly companion by Jonah, he was also able to help mow the lawn.   The silence was shattered by the slam of the door. It came from the new neighbour and seconds later, a figure hurried towards them.  'John? You ok? I called your home but no one picked it up. What are ..' her words trailed off. So this is the sexy neighbour Unce John was talking about. Jonah gazed at her up and down. She was wearing long pants and long sleeve shirt but still he could&nbsp;imagine that she has got a great body underneathe.&nbsp;He was instantly attracted to her. The thought of it got him worked up. No wonder old Uncle John gets worked up easily. Poor him.  'Dana, meet Jonah, my nephew. Jonah, meet Dana.' Uncle John introduced. Jonah only offered a quick smile before dropping his gaze. In that brief moment, he could see that her eyes were a light shade of green. Her bronze hair cascaded past her shoulders and her body was petite but it curved at the right places. In short, she was beautiful. He looked up at the mistletoes before looking down at his feet again.   The man called Jonah was what she thought as rude. Not even a handshake. But she did not take it into consideration much as she has a soft spot for the man's uncle. He's so sweet.  'Well, since you're okay, I'd better go then. See you around John,' Dana said before retreating back to her home.  'What da hell was that for, Jonah? Couldn't you be more friendly?' Uncle John repriminded him. He didn't know what was wrong with him. Normally he would have be friendly with any lady that chatted up with him or he encountered but with that lady, Dana, beautiful name, his social entiquette just fail him. That lady sure has got some sort of magnetic pull in her.  'Damn Jonah. What if she never comes back after that encounter? I'll be bored to death when you're not here,' Uncle John complained exaggeratedly as he got up to go back to his house, it was getting dark.  Don't worry Uncle John. I'll make sure she comes back.'  Jonah thought. Casting another look at Dana's house, he slowly trudged back into the house.
i come home from work ... a little tired but very anxious to see my baby nura ... i open the front door and silently walk in ... i find the house very clean ... all except for a lone sock lying in the living room floor ... i (confused) walk over and pick it up and find that there is another at the foot of the hall ... i go pick it up and find a pair of your jeans and a dark red lacy shirt lying in front of our bedroom door ... i slowly and quietly open our door ... i find you wearing nothing but a black pair of panties and matching bra ... you look slowly and sultry up at me as you slide your hand out of your panties ... you bring your wet fingers up to your mouth and lick them clean before looking deeply into my eyes and saying 'I was just getting warmed up for you, baby.' ... you smile at me and i smile back ... as i walk towards you your back arches slightly and you spread your legs for me to slide between ... i crawl slowly onto the bed and up between your legs ... and i feel your warmth on my body as you wrap your legs around me ... i lower myself to kiss you softly on the lips ... kissing again feeling your tongue passionately mingle with mine ... i feel my (ahem) getting harder through my pants and on your panties ... you squirm excitedely under me as you feel it too ... we kiss deeper and harder as you we slowly and softly grind together ... i fumble with your bra as we kiss ever more passionately ... finally your bra slides off of you ... i softly kiss your nipples and lick all around your breasts ... feeling them getting harder in my mouth ... your hands are at my waist unbuttoning my pants and slide them down slightly ... you take my pants down some and i slide them completely off ... i also take my shirt off so that i can feel your soft skin against mine ... we kiss passionately and i run my fingers down your sexy body ... i love the feel of my hands on you ... i love u ... i ask you if i can take your panties off ... and without a word you take my hands and slide them to the elastic of your panties and help me slide them off ... 'are you sure bout this ...' but before i can get the words out you have already pulled me towards you ... i feel so .. so warm inside as i slide slowly into your hot wet pussy (hope word is okay) ... your so tight and as i get deeper and deeper inside of you you gasp and your eyes close slowly ... 'are u okay baby?'  .... 'Yes Brian, don't stop!' ... i pull out of you slowly and slide in gently loving the feeling as i slide deeper and deeper into you ... feeling your tight pussy sliding around my um ... um ... dick ... dripping wet and so very warm ... you begin to rock with me and i hear you moaning my name softly as i slide in and out of you ... i lean down and kiss and lick your nipples as i slide in and out of you ... feeling so good ... i begin to kiss you deeply, catching the moans before they leave your mouth ... the room is getting hotter and hotter and as it does a little sweat drips off of our bodies ... the sweat runs all over our whole bodies as we are one ... making it easier to slide deeper and deeper inside of you ... as i get a little harder you moan with slight pain but intense joy ... i ask if you want me to stop but you say loudly 'NO, Deeper BRIIIIAAAANNN!' ... i slide deeper and deeper inside of you ... your moans get louder ... soft moans of 'Nurrrraaaaa....' leave my lips almost involuntarily ... you arch your back as you moan even louder as your sweet juices run down onto our white sheets ... you pull yourself harder against me as i grow larger inside of you and slide even deeper into your hot pussy ... your moans turn into screams of joy  'mmmmm Brian more Brian ... Harder ... Deeper ... mmmm Brrrriiiaaannnnnnn!!!' at this time i feel you release me ... and i feel your hot juices explode inside of you ... as you cum i feel a strange surge of energy and sensitivity slide through my body as i cum deeply inside of you ... we both collapse ... our hot bodies lying side by side ... i hold you tight 'I love you Nura Radford/Harrison!' ... with a gasp you say 'I love you too.' ... and we pull each other close ... I lay your head on my chest as you fall asleep in my arms ... this is when i know that i'm the luckiest guy in the world ... so happy to have you by my side !!! --
as you probably know, i am in virginia beach at my grandparents' house.  anyway, we are driving back to ohio tomorrow, and we're leaving at 8 in the morning.  as it is about 10-11 hrs, i wont be able to post the hitter update in time for all of the games, so you will have to do without me.  this probably means you now have no chance whatsoever, but thats life i guess.  i might talk about the 7:05 and later games if i get home in time, probably not. have a good one regardless.
happy friday!  there were a lot of pretty good performances last night by pitchers, only one that i would call a great one, so we will lead off w/ that one.  here it goes: yesterdays best: z. day Mtl: 9 IP, W, 0 ER, 6 H, 0 BB, 4 K against the royals.  day has been doing well this year, despite a 5-6 record, he has an ERA of 3.12.  if he gets some more run support, either through offense or a trade, he could win 15+ a season.  he is a very good young pitcher. c. zambrano ChC: 8 IP, W, 2 ER, 5 H, 4 BB, 7 K.  he is a top 5 pitcher so far this season IMO (schmidt, r johnson, a. benitez, clemens). 7-2 with a 2.27 ERA.  his curveball has a lot more on it this year than what i have seen before.  he is able to depend on that pitch as well, and i think that he has potential to maintain this all season. c. fossum Ari: 6 IP, W, 0 ER, 5 H, 2 BB, 5 K over Bal.  his counterpart, bautista for Baltimore had a perfect game thru 5 or 6 i think, but gave up a 3 run shot the next inning. this was definitely an aberration (he got his ERA below 6), so i wouldnt look for another similar performance any time soon. c. pavano Fla: 8.2 IP, W, 1 ER, 4 H, 1 BB, 7 K.  another pitcher quietly having a good season.  while beckett and burnett are struggling, pavano has been the marlins' rock in the rotation.  2nd straight very good start (6/4 7.2 IP, W, 1 ER), and 6-2, 3.10 on season.  he might be peaking right now, so i dont know if i would hold on to him for the rest of the season. k. ishii LA: 8 IP, W, 1 ER, 6 H, 1 BB, 4 K. also having a good season (8-3, 3.36).  he is getting a bit more run support than last year, not by much, but more nonetheless.  he has shown improvement each of the last 3 yrs, especially w/ his control. c. schilling Bos: 7 IP, W, 2 ER, 6 H, 2 BB, 8 K.  always good for a solid performance, schilling has had a consistent season. for his price, you could probably get a marginally better pitcher, but he is not going to let you down very often.  if you have the money, he is a smart pickup.  those were the best performances of last night.  some pitchers to look for good things from tonight are: livan hernandez Mtl: plays at seattle tonight, who has been a struggling offensive team.  hernandez is known as an inning-eater, so i will predict 7.2 IP, 2 ER, 5 H, and a win (why not go for it all w/ my predictions?) tim hudson Oak: a safe enough pick, playing at home v. Pit, whose offense had been struggling, although they scored 7 yesterday.  i will say 7 IP, 3 ER, 7 H, and a win for tim.  i think the A's can match however many runs the pirates throw up there. al leiter NYM: has an ERA this season below 2 (1.78 i think).  playing against KC only enhances my confidence in him.  i kind of want to say CG shutout, but leiter probably doesnt have that much endurance in him.  7 IP, 1 ER, 2 H, win. brett myers Phi: plays at Min, home of the 'evil ventilation system'.  he will overcome this hardship and get a win in 6.1 innings.  he will give up 3 ER and 6 H. i know this to be a fact (not really...had you fooled there) scott schoeneweis Chisox: my 'out on a limb' pick for the night, he had a great rookie year 3ish yrs ago (along w/ rick ankiel), and has done well this season as well. performance of the night v. Atl-CG 3-hitter, 1 unearned run, 2 BB, 9 K, win.  there you have it, who says i dont have the balls to predict stuff?  hope this is helpful and accurate.  if you find any errors, you will get mentioned in my next post, and maybe you will win a new car!  any comments regarding format and or content are always welcome.  good luck, and have a good one!
here is my 1st hitter update, for yesterdays games.  just one correction from yesterdays pitcher update: the mil/ana game went 17 not 15 innings.  ty to captainfurby for bringing that to my attention.  on w/ the hitter update.  enjoy!  e. renteria StL: 1-4 GS HR, 2 R, 4 BI, 1 BB.  Decent numbers on the yr, only 4 HR. 9 consecutive 1-hit games, .261 avg.  this seems to have been an anomaly.  He is probably the best SS in the NL, but the AL has much better options c. guillen Det: 3-4 HR, 2 R, 1 BI, SB.  Quietly having a very good year for the relatively speaking, rejuvenated tigers.  Batting .326 on the yr w/ 5 3B, 9 HR, 15 2B.  OBP is hovering around .400.  he strikes out a bit too much, but that has always been his case.  Easily his best yr as a pro m. tejada Bal: 2-4 HR, 3 BI, 1 R, 1 BB, 1 K.  broke out of a bit of a slump (2-14, 2 BI since 6/3) in a big way.  Has had a consistent yr for the oâs, batting .312 on the season.  He has established himself as one of the top SS in the league. b. abreu Phi: 2-4, 2 HR, 3 R, 3 BI, 1 BB, 1 K.  has had incredible last 5 games (8-18, 9 R, 7 BI, 6 BB, 3 K, 2 SB, 3 HR, 2 2B).  batting .299 w/ 14 HR on season, he has been very solid for the majority of the season.  I would pick him up now if you still can. Aaron rowand Chisox: 3-5 HR, 2B, 2 R, 3 BI, 1 K.  he has been the teamâs 4th OF all season, but w/ maggs out for an expected 4-7 weeks, it is his chance to shine.  He got off to a great start yesterday.  If you are looking for a cheap player who will start, look no further. d. miller Oak: 2-4 GS HR, 4 BI, 2 R, 1 K.  on a 3-game tear (6-13, 2 HR, 12 BI-yes 12, 4 R, 4 2B).  batting .291 for the season.  He has not been especially good all year, and IMO is somewhat overpriced.  However, if he can keep this up, that will no longer be the case.  This recent tear may have some correlation to redsâ pitching however.  Wait a game or 2, this could be a fluke.  Other players that had notable games last night include: k. greene SD, t. hafner Cle, j. cruz TB, j. dye Oak (another very hot player), and a. dunn Cin (see last parenthetical statement).  There are some obscure players I have adopted as my favorites that I will update you on periodically.  Here are 2: k. youkilis Bos: mentioned profusely in Moneyball by Michael lewis (a fascinating book if youre into these things), his nickname is âthe greek god of walksâ.  He has had a productive rookie season, and last night was 1-3 with a walk.  Batting .286 w/ OBP of .400, look for great things next year and maybe even late this season from him so taguchi StL: 1-4 3B, 1 BB, 2 R last night.  He is also a rookie this yr, and is used primarily as a PH or PR.  Batting .258 on the season, he also has a 1.000 base stealing % (1-1).  He has shown improvement lately, and I think that he could start in a year or 2.  I follow him b/c I like his name. Its going to be the new phrase in StL soon.  People will be like âthat was so taguchiâ, meaning âthat was so clutchâ.  Mark these words, he will be big, baby!  Thatâs it for the hitter wrapup today.  Some games that should have good hitting numbers today are:  Col (j. Jennings) @ NYY (j. Contreras), Mil (w. obermuller) @ Ana (a. sele), and Phi (b. myers) @ ChW (s. schoeneweis).  The last one is just b/c the last 2 games in the series have been 13-11 and 14-10, not b/c of poor pitching.  Any comments you have are welcome.  Hope this is helpful.  Have a good one!
last night saw quite a few outstanding performances by pitchers.  i will go over a few of them as well as give my thoughts on some pitching matchups today.  my family drove to my grandparents' house in virginia beach last night and today, so i will be there for the week.  the 11-hour drive wears on you a bit, but i am recovering now.  so here you are: last night: ben sheets Mil: he turned in the performance of the night and left w/ a ND.  9 innings of 1-hit scoreless ball, but the game went to 15 i believe.  no walks and 5 K as well.  he seems to have fully recovered from the dizziness that made him miss his last start pedro martinez Bos: a great outing in an inconsistent year, he got a W for 8 innings of scoreless 2-hit pitching.  walked 2 and 8 Ks as well. this is in stark contrast to last outing where he gave up 7 ER and 11 hits in 5 IP. i am of the opinion that his ship has been righted for this season (yes i am reversing field from yesterday, i can do that) zack greinke KC: got the win after 7 innings of scoreless 3-hit ball w/ 5 K and no walks. although pitching v. the expos didnt hurt his stats, he has quietly put together a solid year.  he is 1-1 in 4 starts, w/ an ERA of 1.73 over 26 innings (6.5 per start).  a good option for AL only leagues or if youre low on $.  3-1 K-BB ratio looks pretty good also. kelvim escobar Tor: if you want to talk about hot, heres your man.  last 2 outings, he has been 1-0 with 1 ER over 16 innings.  last night he got a ND after 8 innings of scoreless 4-hit ball, including 11 K. 4-2 on the season, 3.34 ERA, and 54-20 K-BB, another good AL-only pickup. he seems to be settling in as a starter after being a reliever 2 yrs ago. randy johnson Ari: big unit rebounded from an average performance last outing, notching a W on 1 run, 3 hits in 7 IP.  only 4 K, but he has been 5-0 beginning w/ the perfect game. 8-4, 2.75 on the season, and is averaging nearly 7 IP per start. other notable performances came from Roger Clemens (0 ER, 3 H, 6.2 IP, 6 BB, 7 K, W), Javier Vazquez (1 ER, 5 H, 7 IP, 0 BB, 6 K, W), Matt Clement (3 ER, 5 H, 8 IP, 1 BB, 9 K, W), as well as Jerome Williams and Ted Lilly. today's games: since i just now have gotten access to a computer, i already know what happened to mark prior today.  after a solid 1st outing, he struggled against st louis.  he went 3.2 innings and gave up 5 ER on 5 hits and 5 BB.  he struck out 1.  he threw 83 pitches, 49 for strikes.  edgar renteria hit a GS in the 4th to knock him out.  as i said yesterday, i would give him another start or 2 to make sure he has recovered (i have to emphasize it when i get something right). other pitchers to look for today would be: b. lawrence SD: although he is pitching against a solid boston lineup, the padres have given him plenty of run support.  last start was solid (1 ER, 5 H, 7.1 IP), and i would look for a performance slightly below that today (this is definitely a limb i am going out on, but he doesnt usually walk many) k. brown NYY: he has been concerned w/ hes control lately, but his walk numbers are very low (17 BB in 78.2 IP). his last start was mediocre, but he is 7-1 on the season.  i would look for another 7 IP, 3 ER and a win from him. j. schmidt SF: after 2 opening losses, 7-0 with a 1-hitter.  last 2 starts have been 2-0 with 14 IP, 3 ER, 7 H, 20 K, and 5 BB.  pitching at TB shouldnt bring him any problems. this is as close to a lock as you can get, i would think. e. milton Phi: another relative unknown i am fond of.  7-1, 3.78 season. last 2 starts, he is 2-0 w/ 14 IP, 2 ER, 8 H, 8 K, and 5 BB.  the white sox offense has been solid this yr, but maggs is out, so milton should have a good start and i believe he should get a W.  that is your wednesday pitcher update. tomorrow we will cover hitters.  feel free to post any feedback whatsoever.  i hope you can find this helpful and enjoyable. have a good one!
this post is my take on who is 'hot' and who is 'cooling off', based on performance over the last week or so.  in the fantasy game i play, players' prices fluctuate pretty closely with their performance, however, some do not (eg Roger Clemens' plummeting (sp?) price).  this is therefore not a barometer of who will make more $, just who has been playing above or below what they have done this season.  that said, here are my picks and their stats last week:  HOT: hitters:  J. Estrada C Atlanta: 8/17, 4 runs, 4 RBI, 4 2B, 1 HR, 4 BB, 2K   injured lineup not hurting Estrada, he has had a career  season  S. Casey 1B Cincinnati: 6/22, 4 runs, 3 RBI, 1 2B, 2 HR, 3K   NL avg. leader on a roll along with his team  JD Drew OF Atlanta: 7/17, 8 runs, 5 RBI, 2 HR, 6 BB, 2 K, 1 SB   injury-free season shows how good he can really be  K. Griffey OF Cincinnati: 8/19, 8 runs, 5 RBI, 4 HR, 6 BB, 3 K   see JD Drew  J. Dye OF Oakland: 7/25, 6 runs, 6 RBI 3 HR, 3 BB, 7 K, 1 SB   trying to prove that hot hot start was no fluke pitchers:  C. Carpenter SP StL: 6/2 7 IP, W, 9 K, 7 H, 3 ER                       6/7 8.1 IP, W, 6 K, 9 H, 3ER   7-1, 3.42 on the season, next start 6/12 at Texas. Cards have   had good run support all season.  low ERA and walk ratios; too   many hits may come back to haunt him though.  Danny Graves RP Cin: blown save 6/5 can't discount 26 saves   already.  the 3.27 ERA for a closer is a bit frightening.   he has 3 games v. Cle this week, and should be good for a save   or 2 in that series  E. Milton SP Phi: 5/30 7 IP, W, 8 K, 3 BB, 1 ER, 3 H                    6/4 7 IP, W, 5 K, 2 BB, 1 ER, 5 H   7-1, 3.78 season, next start 6/9 at ChiSox. only drawback is   that he only averages about 5.2 IP per start.  good control.  M. Prior SP ChC: 6/4 6 IP, ND, 8 K, 2 H, 0 ER   1st game back from rehab was stellar, wait until 6/9 start v.   StL to see if hes back for good.  F. Cordero RP Tex: 2-0, 18 S, 1.90 on season.  has 2 games v. Pit   coming up, then 3 v. StL.  he is ready for a breakthrough IMO.  A. Benitez RP Fla: 1-0, 22 S, .56 season.  has been the best RP   in baseball this season.  very consistent, gives up very few   walks and ER.  should be good for 50+ saves this year.  COOLING OFF: hitters:  Pittsburgh in general- 2-8 last 10 games, Mackowiak, Ward, and   Jack Wilson went a combined 15/81 last week, and 3 games v. Oak   this week don't look promising either.  P. Burrell Phi: 43 RBI on the season, only 1 in the last week as   he went 3/20 with 1 run and 5 K.  L. Overbay 1B Mil: avg is OK (6/16) but earlier power numbers are   way down (1 RBI, 0 HR last week).  3 games each v. Ana and Hou   w/ their pitching is not promising.  V. Guerrero OF Ana: 3 games does not make a slump, but beware.   after his 9 RBI game, he has gone 0-12 w/ 3 K in last 3 games. i   would still hold on to him for now, but keep an eye out. 3   games v. Mil should help.  J. Pierre OF Fla: now has 10 CS on the yr, 3 last wk.  avg. has   also dipped about 15 pts last wk.  moved to 2nd in order has not   helped him produce so far. pitchers:  J. Kennedy SP Col: 4-3 3.64 season, last game only 3 IP before   knocked out.  the hot start is over.  dump him while you can.   next start is 6/9 v. NYY at Coors.  P. Martinez SP Bos: 6/2 ND, 5 IP, 4 K, 2 BB, 11 H, 7 ER   lucky not to get a loss last game.  has been very inconsistent   all year.  maybe if he got a deal signed...  injured pitchers:    J. Beckett Fla: 15 day, 5/31, blister   R. Halladay Tor: 15 day 6/4 (retroactive 5/28) shoulder   J. Peavy SD: 15 day 5/27 (r.a. 5/20) forearm sleeper:  Kevin Youkilis 3B Bos: the star of Moneyball by Michael Lewis is   having a consistent rookie season.  over the last week, he is   4/20 w/ 2 runs, 4 RBI, 1 2B, 1 HR, 2 BB, 4 K.  i wouldn't take   him now unless i was nearly out of money, but i will update you    on him periodically.  this ends the first weekly wrap-up.  please comment on anything you disagree with or feel i omitted.  also feel free to comment on the general feedback.  as few people are reading this right now, you have a chance to shape this site significantly for the future.  also, since few people read this, i have no choice but to listen to you, so send whatever you want and tell everybody you know about this.  hope you enjoy and find this helpful. p.s. i took the joke thing off, so you can no longer be offended.
for all of you millions of people who are already fastidiously reading everything i write and have waited all night for a new post, here you go.  i have decided to dedicate the bulk of this site to analyzing fantasy baseball.  when the season is over, i will probably shift the focus to something else, maybe politics or something.  regardless, i hope to dedicate sundays, wednesdays, and fridays to pitchers, thursdays, saturdays, and mondays to hitters, and tuesday to a weekly wrap-up (it fits my schedule).  today is tuesday, so you get a weekly wrap-up, i guess.  that will be my next post. p.s.  this is a disclaimer on the jokes on the bottom right.  i just signed up for the service.  i realize some are kind of tasteless, but the majority are good enough.  sorry if you are offended.
sorry about that last link, it definitely does not work.  even if you are logged in to smallworld.com (where this link will take you) it will only tell you your team center not mine.  so i will encourage you to make your own fantasy baseball team anyway (it is free).  if you read this and want to join a league, there is a league you can join.  the league is called 'Mrowo' and the password is 'facejr' (I did not make this up).  register at smallworld.com and join basic fantasy baseball season 1.  the season is over halfway over, so you probably cant catch up, but it is still fun, and you can do season 2 after all-star game.  my team is tickle me hinrich.  if you have trouble email me at zmattyb@yahoo.com.
here is a link to see my fantasy baseball scores every day.  im not sure if these will work or not, and i think you have to be a member of smallworld.com (sporting news fantasy games) for it to work.  that probably narrows down the field quite a bit actually now that i think about it.  regardless, i will post this anyway and hope it works.
whats up?  my name is matthew, and i live in columbus, oh.  i am going to be a senior in high school next year.  i play golf and soccer, and i work as a caddy at scioto country club.  i love all sports and follow them pretty closely.  i also love fantasy sports, especially baseball.  i will try to get some links up so you can check out other stuff about me, once i figure this out.
sorry that i have not been updating this site very faithfully lately.  if i do this, i have to do it in the morning, and i am either golfing, caddying, or sleeping pretty much every morning. so i am afraid this is not going to be a daily update thing unless somebody can think of a more effective format (eg not talking about the results from last nights games).  if anybody has any good ideas regarding the future of this page, they are more than welcome (actually they dont even have to be good).  i can figure something out, but your input helps.  thank you.
sorry im a day late i know.&nbsp; i was out late last night, if i posted when i got home it would have been monday anyway.&nbsp; this weeks top 5 is: vegetables (for inspiration read my other blog).&nbsp; actually it is 'vegitables'.&nbsp; anyway, here we go:  5. rudabega- as mentioned before, i do these in reverse order, so this is the last one and i am out of ideas.&nbsp; i have never had this, the word just sounds cool.&nbsp; its my list, i can do what i want with it...  4. peas- cooked only, the pods taste weird.&nbsp; like corn, you can mix them with a lot of foods and they taste good.  3. carrots- only in carrot stick form though.&nbsp; i dip them in butter when no one is looking.&nbsp; cooked carrots lose the texture which is the main attraction for me.&nbsp; 20 million bunny rabbits cant be wrong :)  2. broccoli- i developed an attachment to this at a young age when everyone else hated it and i didnt.&nbsp; only good cooked however, as i was traumatized when i saw wormy type things in uncooked broccoli once (still makes me 'ick', right now i am paranoid-ically scratching my head).&nbsp; very good with melted cheese  1. corn-off the cob, i can mix this 'vegitable' with the rest of the food on my plate and it will taste good.&nbsp; on the cob it is just soooo fun to eat...i dont know why i ever leave the house except to buy it...it is good with butter and a slight peppering  so there are my top 5 'vegitables'.&nbsp; if you think this is a dumb topic, IM headoflettuce43 and give him a piece of your mind.&nbsp; otherwise, feel free to chime in with your sentimental 'vegitable' stories.&nbsp; until next sundayish time period, this has been your top 5.&nbsp; actually it will be after that period too...
wow i almost forgot about this...but dont fear.&nbsp; hmm this list will be spontaneous...thinking.&nbsp; here we go.&nbsp; this kind of sucks, but its all i can come up with at this time.&nbsp; this weeks top 5 category is: &nbsp; places i would most like to live post-college: &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;hmm...i do these in reverse order, so this is tough...ha, heres an interesting one.&nbsp; london.&nbsp; i think it would be interesting to see how different life is over there.&nbsp; that is the one foreign country i would most like to visit, and my friend said the ladies enjoy american accents :) . i would definitely have to visit there before i decided to live there though.&nbsp; its intriguing nonetheless. &nbsp; 4. boston- i am running out of ideas, but i liked the city.&nbsp; this would probably mean that i ended up going to mit or harvard, which is fine (although im not too big on harvard).&nbsp; i enjoy snow&nbsp;and cold, so i would be at home there.&nbsp; the negatives are that the natives dont seem particularly friendly, and nobody cares about college football there (ooh, boston college...ha!) i guess #1 has a similar dilemma though...boston is a nice enough city &nbsp; 3. columbus oh- although its kind of boring, there are much worse.&nbsp; i am quite used to it, and its a pretty affordable place to live.&nbsp; then you have the buckeyes and the central location of the vaunted buckeye nation (it seems like every other car has a bumper sticker or vanity plate or flag for osu...its awesome!).&nbsp; i would like to have some space from my family though. &nbsp; 2. chicago- i almost liked this as much as #1 (see that shortly), but i didnt get to see much of it, so im not positive.&nbsp; the area on lake shore drive was gorgeous though.&nbsp; plus a great sports town (always a plus :) ) &nbsp; 1. nyc (manhattan preferably)- i went there this spring break, and my visit only made me more enamored of the city than what i had been before.&nbsp; in addition to being the 'financial capital of the world' which is kind of my desired career area right now (yes its not terribly exciting, but i find it interesting) its like the citys generators could cut out and the city would still run bc there is so much energy there, if that makes sense.&nbsp; it was awesome, and i would love to live there (although not cheap i would guess).&nbsp; sidenote: i was there the day before the NIT final which michigan was in.&nbsp; when i was walking around times sq i saw 3 tall guys in michigan warmups, so im guessing they were on the basketball team.&nbsp; i wanted to get a pic of the 4 of us holding up our arms like 'O-H-I-O', but i kind of wussed out.&nbsp; but i did see them (i think one was courtney sims, very good soph center/forward/not sure).&nbsp; so you can see famousish people there too :) &nbsp; as you can probably see, i would like to live in a big city.&nbsp; i just find small towns kind of depressing bc there seems to be no variety in the life there.&nbsp; it strikes me as a lack of progress, which is something that scares me, in any form.&nbsp; i know that every place has its own advantages, and i have nothing against small towns, they just dont seem to be for me (watch as i end up living in one for the rest of my life).&nbsp; to each his (or her for those that are politically correctly? inclined) own, right?
(actually from 7.11.04) yes this is edition 2 of the weekly top 5. this is a big step towards consistency, as i have not yet forgotten about this. about 2 more of these and i would think that this will have been solidified as a definite 'department' of the blog. without much further ado, this weeks top 5 is: 'things i heard the most at camp'  5) 'hows it going, hoppy?' according to camp lore, hoppy is some guy from 100 years ago who was made fun of bc he had a curved spine and a short leg. to make a long story short, he was found dead in a cave, frozen to death while clutching a fawn to keep it warm. since i was kind of hopping around (w/ crutches) this nickname was bestowed upon me, and it spread quite quickly. it could be worse i guess.  4) 'hows the ankle?' pretty self-explanatory...as you hear this question more and more, you kind of get a default answer without many details once you realize that they dont want to know that badly.  3) 'i have to pee' to be expected w/ 3rd grade guys. we had a buddy system, which grew much more relaxed as the week progressed. my response went from 'get your buddy' to 'just go in the woods or something'. peeing in the woods is part of the camp experience, right?  2) 'my (insert authority figure, usually male, such as dad/grandpa) can (insert impressive feat that is usually doubled in exaggeration)' as covered yesterday, these kids still idolize their parents/whoever else. some of these stories were obviously fabricated, some were probably true. another fun thing that came up a lot about parents was personal information such as diets/weight/age of parents. these parents might want to rethink telling the kids this stuff...  1) 'what did you do to your ankle?/how did you manage THAT?' imagine telling about 100 people (literally) that your injury was from something as dumb as jumping off of a slide from 1 foot off the ground. i would have liked my injury to have been from something a bit more respectable, maybe i dived into the pool to save a kid from drowning or something like that. humility is a good thing...  there you have it. i am off to watch some us olympic trials for track & field now, then a 2-hour special on trading spaces! (yes i am quite serious, i happen to enjoy that show, and no, this does not mean i am gay) some of the designers on the other hand...
(actually from 7.4.04) i have just had a revolutionary concept...every sunday i will give you my opinion on my personal top 5 somethings. this is very tentative, and it is more than possible that this will be the only one. with that in mind, the first category is...music albums! these are all from the last 7 or so years, so there was never really consideration for any classic albums. as you can see, most of these albums are from my favorite bands, which is no coincidence. without further ado, here are my top 5...  5. a rush of blood to the head- coldplay i got this cd last year, and i listened to it on my way to every golf match...its very calming, and i love every track from 1-7. 4. just be- tiesto this is that new (to me at least) trance album i have been raving about. the best song on it is by far the 1st track (forever today), which is probably in the top 5 songs (hint hint) for me. who says the london club scene is weak? i think he is the #1 dj in the world...heady stuff. 3. e-majn- cloud2ground another incredible techno/trance album. this is what got me addicted to the trance/indie thing. the best 2 tracks are #1 (raindown) and #6 (face2face)- which is the most beautiful song i have heard (other than amazing grace on bagpipes and possibly lee greenwoods 'God bless the usa') anyway, its an awesome album, except i dont really like the last 2 tracks. the 1st 7 are incredible 2. the anatomy of the tongue in cheek- relient k this is the most diverse album up here. they always have a couple of goofy songs on their album, the difference here is that those songs are really sweet (im lion-o, may the horse be with you). i also love the raw emotion in these words are not enough and for moments when i feel faint, and down in flames and failure to excommunicate are awesome as well. the fact that this is not their most recent album yet it makes up about half their concert set says something about the strength of this album. 1. ok computer- radiohead how do i love thee...let me count the ways...about 9, as in 9 of the best songs ever (actually track 7 doesnt really count, but its funny anyway). 3-5 kind of suck, but it seems that every compilation cd i make has at least 3 songs from this album. the guitar solo in paranoid android is one of the best of the post-hendrix era imo, and electioneering is still my favorite songs even though it is about 7 years old. karma police, airbag, and climb up the walls (the song that made me get...actually burn...this cd in the 1st place). kid a and their newest one arent as good as this, but radiohead is still a remarkable band.  there you have it...edition 1 of my top 5. if anyone has differing opinions (there should be no differing with this list) feel more than free to post a comment, i would love to hear from you (yes, you).
this weeks edition (on time might i add) is inspired by last weeks espn/usa today coaches poll for college football.  it is: top 5 most overrated teams not named ohio state in the top 25.  5. clemson (16)-a 'hot pick' bc of a qb and a win over fsu last yr...and a coachs last name (bowden).  very difficult schedule, and i dont think they are very good on d either way.  projection: 7-5, outside top 25 (on record projections, im not sure exactly how many games each team will play, which could make some records impossible.  im just lazy i guess).  4. k state (13)-without roberson, teams can stack the box easily and at least slow sproles down.  not a very tough schedule, they might end up top 10, but i still wont think theyre that good.  projection: 10-3, #13  3. miami (5)-sorry to knock on them so much here...not really.  they lost a lot of talent, and they play a real schedule this yr.  projection: 10-3, #11  2. virginia (19)-overrated last yr, only difference is that they lost a qb (schaub) hmm...sounds like a top 25 team...only thing they have is solid lb play.  projection: 7-5, outside top 25  1. auburn (18)-remember last years 'sleeper' team?  the one that slept pretty soundly offensively vs. usc in opener (23-0 i believe)?  they came on in the middle of the season, but i dont think theyre anything special.  projection: 8-5, outside top 25  i could obviously be completely wrong on all of these, its mainly just my gut...at least i had the balls to pick them.  we shall see what happens.  i cannot wait for college football season!!!!!
just got back from driving my neighbor back from the airport (i run a taxi company in my spare time...).  there was a bad accident on 270 east just west of 71.  there was a semi overturned on the side, and there was a pickup w/ a boat on back in the road w/ its front end completely smashed.  they had to block off 2 or 3 lanes of 270 which just left 3 open.  it was pretty congested.  i think i cut about 5 or 6 people off to get through all of the traffic, but i had to get to the airport in time (i ended up having about 15 minutes to spare).  so im kind of wondering if everybody involved is ok or not.  there were a bunch of cops plus a crane there, but i didnt see an ambulance, which either means it had already come or nobody was hurt.  i can probably update you on this tomorrow.  it was kind of sobering to see after i was getting very frustrated with traffic before i knew what happened.  i guess tomorrow is never guaranteed.  now im getting philosophical here...there now im over it :) .  im going to go watch last comic standing now.  that show is kind of dumb, but i am somewhat addicted (what else are you going to do on a tuesday night other than sit at home and watch tv?...rhetorical question alert).  peace out my children
i just got finished cleaning my bathroom!  it was the first time i ever did the whole thing by myself.  i scrubbed the toilet and bathtub, and the counter, and then i mopped the floor.  now i am kind of sticky.  nonetheless i am quite proud of myself.  today i decided to stay home to do stuff around the house.  i am being forced to make a filing system for the whole college application thing, so i spent a couple of hours this morning setting that up.  after that i cut the grass, which is when i found out that it is really quite a nice day out.  this afternoon i will probably go play with my neighbors cat (as a job, not just because i have nothing better to do) then go hit balls at the range. another exciting thing today...i got my sat II subject test scores back in the mail.  i got 800 on math IIC, 740 chemistry and 740 writing.  i was quite shocked, especially about the chemistry which i thought i got about 550 on, and especially since i was almost dead the day i took it (sick, i slept the entire day after i got back.  very very sick, not to mention miserable.  my theory is that in every test room there is a sick kid who is sniffling and coughing constantly.  i just happened to be that person that day.)  the thing that surprised me is that the 800 (perfect score) is only the 90 percentile, which means 10% of the people get a perfect.  i guess its not that incredibly hard or something.  anyway, i am just excited about that whole thing.  :))))))  (not sure how to make excited smiley, he is smiling a lot though, as you can see. hopefully its good enough)
yes, this means that i am back home again.  actually we got back saturday night, but i have been pretty busy.  the trip was awesome.  the only other times i have been to chicago (twice) were just connector flights through o'hare, so this was the first time i had seen the city.  we stayed downtown, so we walked around the lake shore park area, which was beautiful.  unfortunately, the traffic was terrible (worse than nyc, imo, i have heard that la traffic is worse...i really pity them if it is), so everything like the museums and shedd aquarium was closed.  the next day (friday) we went to visit campus.  i loved u chicago.  it just felt like they had the same sort of priorities that i would want (they also seemed proud that theyre the only school undefeated vs. notre dame in football...yeah, 1-0 or something).  the campus was beautiful too.  i think it is probably in my top 3 schools now (yale, william and mary), plus its a little easier to get into.  i was surprised at how seriously chicago took its baseball.  the city series (cubs/sox) was starting up the day we left, so that probably contributed, but the obsession was nearing the ohio state football level in columbus (an inascertainable level, the benchmark of all irrational obsessions i would say...although not a bad one by any means).  i think i could live in a city like that. after the visit, we drove to st louis friday night.  our hotel room was upgraded to a vip suite...we were the 'customer of the day'...not sure what that is all about, but the room was cool.  we ate at j bucks in clayton (suburb), where i realized that st louis was probably as into sports as chicago.  i guess that there isnt much else in the midwest that we are so narrow-minded.  anyway, saturday morning we visited wustl, which i liked, not as much as uc, but it seemed to be a place i wouldnt mind going to.  i think i will apply there too. we got back saturday night so i would have time to go to a meeting sunday morning for camp counselors for a camp i am helping with at my church.  i get to be with 3rd grade boys for a week (july 6-10 i think).  it will be interesting to say the least.  i am looking forward to it. this morning i had my first tournament of the yr.  i was gang-raped by mosquitoes early on, so i am trying to move as little as possible now.  i overcame them to an extent, and i ended up shooting 89.  while that sounds terrible, i actually played very well, i just had 3 bad holes (2 triple-bogeys and a quad).  if you take those away it was a decent round, plus the course was tough and i hadnt played it before.  i tied for 2nd in the tournament (that should give you an idea of how 'strong' the league is-86 won it).  the group i played in was pretty bad.  on one whole we lost 8 balls (as a foursome).  the other kids kept having to go back and re-hit from the tee.  i just sat on the ground and waited, then i started cracking up...kind of like the judges on american idol during auditions.  i felt mean, but i couldnt help it.  the kids behind us were getting pretty mad, which was probably the funniest part.  they hit into us a couple of times...you have to find humor in these things i guess.  there were scores of 12 and 10 on that hole (and they both kind of cheated, but i felt bad for them).  in case youre wondering, i lost a ball but still made bogey-6 (it would have been a birdie if i hadnt lost a ball) so ha. i believe i am going to go see spiderman 2 wednesday night.  brad picked up a bunch of tickets, so hopefully everyone will be early so i dont have to sit in the aisle again (see dodgeball post).  i should probably rent the 1st spiderman since i still havent seen it.  i think thats all i have to say...this is a pretty long post, congrats if you made it all the way here:) the end.
i am not going to be posting on this for a couple of days, as i am going on a couple of college visits with the parents.  we are driving (grr) to chicago tomorrow and visiting u chicago, then to st louis to visit washington u in stl.  i am looking forward to both, even though i have been bombarded with mail from wustl (i dont care about a postcard with alumni giving rates or percentage of graduates getting into medical school 4 times a week).  somebody needs to tell them this.  it actually decreases my interest. i caddied for the first time this year.  got a double bag at 12:40, just in time for the sun to be baking on me the entire day (who would want to caddy when its not 90 degrees with no clouds or wind).  this would have been a perfect day to golf.  complaining aside, i made 130, so it was more than worth it.  my shoulder might differ with me on that.  i couldnt hold the steering wheel driving back home after the loop bc my shoulder was so weak (unlike the rest of my body...) on a side note, i saw the 'soup nazi' episode on tbs tonight.  all of my friends have told me about it and quoted it, so i was expecting a lot.  it was nothing special though.  i guess my hopes were too high.  i thought the gay thugs that stole elaines armoire from kramer were funnier.  that has to be the most brilliant show EVER. yes, EVER. anyway, i have an early departure time tomorrow, so i should get to bed soon.  i should be back by sunday.
i am sick of getting up at 5:44 every morning!  even if i can get to bed by 11:30 or 12 i still only get 6 hours of sleep...i cant live like this! i 'accidentally' broke my 8-iron shaft on saturday, so i took it in yesterday to get a new one.  i didnt throw it hard or anything, so im guessing it was pretty weak already.  thats $25 down the drain. i went to a party last night at chales'.  we played crap (a billiards game, not the casino thing), and i kept getting stuck behind cody who is really gay and kept giving me letters, so i only won once.  it was embarassing since i am incredible at that game...maybe ;)
another quiz i found on a blog that i coveted and therefore stole from a certain someone (if you are reading this, sorry, its being put to good use, i love your blog).  this may seem like im obsessed with golf. im not, but its a big part of my life, esp in the summer, so i mention it a lot.  anyway, here we go:  1. what is the geekiest part of your music collection?

its been a while (2 whole days) since the last post, so this might be a bit long, we shall see.  yesterday, i played 27 holes of golf.  i sucked up the first 9, but then i came back w/ a 39 on the back, so i went an extra 9 holes to try to break 80 (an elusive goal that has consumed my golfing life since i broke 90).  i started off fine, but i had 2 straight 3-putts and a lost ball, which killed me, so i ended up with 39-44 83, which is my best for this season as of yet.  i was happy enough, but i know i blew it.  that just gives me something to push for this summer i guess. last night i saw dodgeball with a bunch of friends.  i got there late, so we had to sit in the aisle.  then some usher kicked us out bc it was a 'fire hazard'.  we got back in, but we had to split up.  i ended up next to some guy in the 2nd row.  there were some interesting parts, i will say that (the pizza thing, ick), but it was funny for the most part.  it could have been better, but it fulfilled its purpose of mindless entertainment imo.  we went out for sushi after that.  i dont really like sushi, but it was fun. this morning i played golf w/ my dad, my pastor, and another guy from church.  they wouldnt play for money (6-6-6 $5 nassau), which is unfortunate bc i won every 6 w/ my partner (we played for 'bragging rights', which last time i checked wont help pay for tuition).  nobody, including myself, played particularly well, but we had a good time.  after that, i went to gregs grad party at 'the barn' in westerville.  its a pretty cool place, i wouldnt mind having mine there. so there is my activity list of the last couple days.  after the party i sat at home and watched the us open.  did anybody else see the 7 green?  i have only played 1 green like that, and it is completely unfair (i 5-putted it in a tournament, it kept rolling backwards 20+ feet).  that shouldnt happen in a professional tournament.  however, everyone played the same unfair green, so in a roundabout way it was fairish.  i am pulling for phil, but i dont have anything against anybody near the top.  it should be fun to watch.
hmm, i think todays theme would be rain, which causes things to become wet when exposed to it, including people such as myself.  i played golf today, but i had to call it a round after 16 holes bc of this natural phenomenon.  not too much of a loss, as it was not a particularly good round.  i think i was rushing things out there today.  i went to the range around noon, and the only part that was open were the mats (no chipping/putting or grass tees).  i hate hitting off mats, but its better than not hitting. also contributing to todays theme is the us open, which is currently delayed bc of rain. not like i would be able to watch it since we dont get espn anymore...grr.  the course doesnt seem to be playing that difficile. on a side note, i do believe that detroit won the nba title, and for that they are offerred (sp?) my most sincere congrats.  as for the lakers, there is always next yr (oh wait, no there isnt).  hahaha they are going to get disbanded i hope.  they were the closest thing this age in sports will get to a dynasty imo.  its the circle of life applied to sport.  if you think about it, you can apply most of lifes themes to sport...  its growing on you isnt it?
i hate it when i prove myself wrong.  the class today was so awesome. it had nothing to do with going the speed limit or not cutting people off.  we did a skid car, drag racing, and cone maneuverability.  we also did this thing where you floor it through water then slam on the brakes and control your skid so you dont run over 'kenny' (aka a bunch of cones).  needless to say i killed kenny quite a few times (where have i seen this before?).  it was still fun, and i met a lot of new people (john, richard, erica, amanda, feel free to comment now).  it rained a lot too, which made the skid car even skiddier.  i guess that this was in fact not a wasted day.  another bonus, i drove through amish country to get there, and i got to pass a real horse and buggy thing on the road!  i figured it was an urban legend (or rural legend is more like it...boo, not funny), but its not.  so all in all a good day. im probably going to the class party at dans tonight, that might go a bit late.  wow, it just kind of hit me that im a senior now.  how empowering...
another day, another 85 on the links.  this one i was not happy with.  i was +2 thru 7 holes then i fell apart.  i only hit 4 greens, so i guess it could have been much worse.  the heat got to me again, i couldnt make 36 holes.  ill probably go hit at the driving range this afternoon or something.  i just remembered, tomorrow my mom is making me take an all-day 'defensive driving' class.  grr.  i dont need help driving, since i havent had any accidents or tickets in over a year.  i am viewing tomorrow as a wasted day. maybe i will end up enjoying it (smirks knowingly).
i slept in some this morning, so i only got 18 holes in today.  i think the weather could best be described as sweltering...i was dying.  anyway, i played so much better than yesterday, i shot 85 on a much harder course.  i could have done better, but my irons apparently all decided to go about 15 yards farther than normal today.  that took me about 8 holes to figure out...i flew the green of a 155 yard par 3 with a 7-iron by about 20 yards.  that is a complete anomaly, quite frustrating.  however, it was encouraging.  i finally got to see day after tomorrow w/ cody and chad.  it was pretty good.  some of the effects were a bit weak, but they would be hard to do.  we got our popcorn ($5.50!) from seth gemperline.  i hadnt realized he worked there.  if it doesnt rain too hard tonight im going to go play another 18 or 36 tomorrow, depending on how early i feel like getting up.  i ran out of water for about 6 holes today, and i am still feeling a bit sick (hence the post name).  i should be able to overcome this however.

i really hope the pistons can make this lead stand up.  shaq is killing us this game.  at least its interesting this time around.  i added a different counter.  guess what, it doesnt work either.  ack this is easily the worst thing that has ever happened to me.
after church today, i played 9 holes with my dad.  this is only my 3rd time out this yr since i have been so busy w/ school and stuff.  i hit the ball like complete trash.  seriously, i was so mad.  i shot a 46, and thats only b/c i made 4 15+ foot putts.  i have a lot of work to do this summer if i want to be worth anything on the team this fall.  i just got a membership at a local club for the summer, so im going to go play 36 holes tomorrow if i can.  talked to dan, he just got back from mexico.  we might go play tomorrow if he doesnt have to work all day.  im getting excited for the pistons tonight...i still hope they kill LA.  speaking of that  urlLink i read this great article on espn.com.  they even make fun of devean george.  there is a link on here, but if you dont want to read the whole thing, heres the best part...         Six days ago, most people outside of Detroit thought there was     no way they could contain Devean and the Hall of Famers. Now     it seems impossible that the Lakers will be able to stand up     to the soul tide rolling through this series.  ha.  what do you have to say now, devean?  nothing? thats what i thought.
freaking hit counter, work!  maybe its overloaded with all this traffic i am getting... grr i hate those white boxes with red x's.  what are you going to do, eh?
after getting up around 7 (ack) the drive to ohio was only about 9 1/2 hrs, not bad.  then i got to go mow the lawn before it rains again, bad.  i made it though.  i just downloaded this awesome song by some scandinavian techno guy (tiesto or something like that).  i think all techno should be illegal unless its scandinavian.  this is incredible stuff. -- i spent a lot of time this week watching the reagan funeral.  i dont think there is any more touching song than amazing grace.  when they get to the last stanza, i get chills.  then during the burial ceremony, they had a guy play it on bagpipes.  that is even better than scandinavian techno-my favorite song on my favorite instrument!  i guess the bagpipe is a love/hate thing, i find it eerily beautiful.  i find european music better than american for the most part i guess. i want bagpipes at my funeral! this whole funeral thing has put me in somewhat of a reflective mood.  its kind of like 'what will i do that people will talk about at my funeral'.  its a motivating thought to me.  anybody with me on that? -- during the drive i read a book called the chosen by chaim potok.  it starts out like any enjoyable fiction story, then it gets really deep into things like hardcore friendship and philosophy and that kind of stuff. it reminded me of another book, a separate peace by john knowles. it was quite engrossing.  i would recommend it to anyone who considers themself introspective.  so that in conjunction with the whole funeral bit has put me in a bit of a reflective, morbid, and rambling mood. -- i think i will go update my other blog and go catch some SNL or something.  take the care!
i was at my grandparents' house this week in virginia beach. it has been scorching lately, but its raining right now.  not a thunderstorm or anything, just rain.  honestly, my favorite weather is a summer thunderstorm at dusk.  it is so awesome to listen to.  i always sleep with my window open those days.  anyway, we are driving back to ohio tomorrow, and we are supposed to leave at 8.  this is not what i had in mind for summer vacation.  such is life i guess.
this is my second blog. i started doing a blog of fantasy baseball update type stuff (i will make a link soon in case you care), so this is a more personal blog.  feel free to comment or share your thoughts (a form of commenting if you think about it) whereever you want to. i was watching the nba finals game 3.  i am sooo incredibly glad the pistons won.  i hate the lakers, seriously hate them.  especially devean george annoys me.  he is like a leech that just hangs onto kobe and shaq, and then when he needs to contribute, he cant step it up.  when detroit went on a run in the 3rd, rip was running a break after a board, and george was trying to guard him, but he is too slow, so he just flopped.  thankfully he didnt get the call, but i cant stand players like that (see vlade divac).  anyway, the only laker i really respect is kobe.  at least he tries all the time, unlike his team for the most part.  he really is a great player.  now that i think about it, i dont have much against shaq.  i just hope the pistons can pull this off.  on a side note, has anyone seen that viagra commercial with the fat and old guys jumping around with queen 'we are the champions' playing in the background?  if you think about it, there are some disgusting implications there.  i get so sick whenever i think about it.  therefore, i will try to make you sick as well. sorry, its too late to change anything.  i believe i will go get some sleep now.  have a great friday, now that it is officially friday.
it has been awhile since i got up as early as 5:19.&nbsp; it wasnt that bad actually.&nbsp; i got to the course before it was open, so i ended up teeing off around 6:35.&nbsp; i ran into this guy from the grounds crew that absolutely hates me 4 times this round.&nbsp; i hit into him once while he was mowing the green, and&nbsp;i thought he had seen me.&nbsp; now he interrogates me every time, like 'did you check in with the starter', then 'who was there', and 'you shouldnt be starting this early, give us a chance to mow these'.&nbsp; its very frustrating, especially when i see him yukking it up (yes i just said that.&nbsp; its a cool phrase...) w/ other golfers.&nbsp; of course, he might just hate me bc i am young or something.&nbsp; who knows...the round went ok.&nbsp; i have a lot to work on, so i struggled at least in the scoring category, but i hit the ball pretty well.&nbsp; i only had 1 birdie though.&nbsp; need to work on that... when i went to the parking lot to leave, i found that there was a beer delivery truck right in front of my car with no possible escape, so i was stuck there for about 10 minutes.&nbsp; i just thought i would share that, since it was a minor annoyance.&nbsp; i made it throught that though. in other news, the saturn is working again.&nbsp; the battery was indeed dead, so my mom took it to the shop for me, and its all better (hopefully).&nbsp; now i dont have to give my dad a ride to work again which means getting up 20 minutes earlier.&nbsp; (yay)
i was driving to my golf lesson today, and i saw a hitchiker on the entrance ramp from 23 north onto 270 east.&nbsp; for those not acquainted with i-270, it is basically a circle around columbus (i guess there is one in st louis as well, and then i-70 runs through both cities too...creepy).&nbsp; anyway, i found this a humorous spot to try to catch a ride.&nbsp; she wasnt going to get any farther than 25 miles from where she started (yes i know people can take exit ramps onto other highways, it was just funny).&nbsp; i am considering starting a new blog for stuff i see on the road.&nbsp; i probably wont, but its a consideration.&nbsp; now if i was a trucker or something i would definitely do this, and i would love to read something like that.&nbsp; many interesting sights out there... the dispute thingy from AIM has been cleared up thank goodness. now&nbsp;i can sleep, which is great since i am leaving at 5:40 tomorrow (leaving, not waking up).&nbsp; this is bc the saturn wouldnt start.&nbsp; i think it is the battery, so its getting towed tomorrow.&nbsp; meanwhile, i will drive my dad to work then go play golf after that.&nbsp; i think im going to bed within a half-hour. i started reading jane eyre tonight, and i fell asleep about 30 pages into it.&nbsp; i think it was me being tired as opposed to it being boring, which was the case with 'texas' by james michener which put me to sleep 4 times.&nbsp; that book took me so long, probably twice as long as any other book i have ever read. &nbsp;literally (maybe not the Bible, but thats it).&nbsp; jane eyre is actually fairly interesting, even in the beginning.&nbsp; i have high expectations for it now... one other thing: i was on  urlLink espn.com &nbsp;today and i was reading about bad athlete-turned-musicians, and they had audio clips.&nbsp; one was pro wrestlers or something.&nbsp;  urlLink here is a link to some 30 second clips , the worst one in my opinion is track 10.&nbsp; its like elmer fudd meets a 3-year old banging on a pot or something.&nbsp; definitely a must hear.&nbsp; if that doesnt keep you up all night, nothing will :)
well, yesterday i was talking to various people on AIM and i think i managed to get 5 or 6 people mad in some way or another.&nbsp; all bc of a misstatement.&nbsp; this is why i dont like talking on AIM, bc you cant clarify things and they can get out of hand.&nbsp; grr...hopefully things will work out, i think they will.&nbsp; like i said earlier, i hate having people mad at me.&nbsp; i cant sleep and i get all stressed out.&nbsp; i think thats bc of my analytical mind which makes me constantly thinking about the whole situation. i did talk to ryan (my friend from florida, now kentucky) yesterday, and he is probably coming up this weekend.&nbsp; if he does, i think he might stay with me.&nbsp; i havent seen him in so long, i am kind of worried that he has changed.&nbsp; people tend to do that... i golfed this morning.&nbsp; i was just teeing off on #1 w/ nobody in sight when a guy came up behind me and asked if i wanted to play alone or not, of course i said 'you can join, sure, blah blah blah' even though i didnt really want to.&nbsp; it was and older guy named john, hes been a member there for about 20 years.&nbsp; he was nice enough, but he kept complaining about how bad he was playing.&nbsp; that gets kind of annoying.&nbsp; then on #10 we were joined by another older guy named joe from alabama.&nbsp; the good thing about those 2 is that they were pretty fast, but we ended up being stuck behind a group the entire time, so my round took about 3 1/2 hrs.&nbsp; i almost holed out for eagle on #12, a par 5.&nbsp; i laid up to about 100 yards, then i took a half-pitching wedge, and stuck it about 4 inches from the hole.&nbsp; that was easily the highlight of my day as i did not play very well (yes i am a hypocrite for complaining about golf, but this is why i have this blog, to complain and so forth).&nbsp; at the beginning of the round, every time i stepped over the ball, i KNEW i was going to hit a bad shot.&nbsp; it has been a few years since that happened.&nbsp; i did par all 4 par 3s though, kind of.&nbsp; they kept giving me putts whenever i hit it within 3 feet or so and hitting them back to me.&nbsp; oh well, its probably for the better that i didnt have an 'official score'.&nbsp; such is life
my senior picture photo shoot went well as far as i could tell.&nbsp; i felt a little awkward with some of the poses, like when i was lying on the floor and he was like 'roll towards me a little bit'.&nbsp; i felt like a bikini model or something (since i obviously know exactly what that feels like).&nbsp; that withstanding, i think everything should turn out well.&nbsp; when i first talked to him today, he said 'if i remember correctly, you tend to blink a lot.'&nbsp; grr...this was bc he took the golf team pictures outside last fall and i was staring into the sun...all bc i wanted to have the girls soccer team in the background :)&nbsp; i think it was worth it.&nbsp; i only blinked during one picture today though.&nbsp; i have no idea when i will get the pictures back or at least see them.&nbsp; hopefully soon. i finished the hunchback of notre dame today (finally!).&nbsp; i honestly have no idea how they made a wishbone episode out of that book.&nbsp; 75% of it is not suitable for little kids.&nbsp; that is on the conservative end, too.&nbsp; it was quite a depressing ending, and the entire book was kind of scattered as well as morbid.&nbsp; i have mixed feelings on it...next up is jane eyre, which i think is the ultimate chick book.&nbsp; my mom reads it pretty much every year.&nbsp; i am looking forward to this less than i was rebecca.&nbsp; i think its the longest book i have to read, too.&nbsp; i guess i will have to suck it up at get it over with, right?&nbsp; (yes)
last night i was at a party at chads, and brad told me he knew a kid named john corkendorfer in michigan.&nbsp; i found this quite enlightening.&nbsp; this has got to be one of the coolest names ever.&nbsp; seriously, say it out loud, and you instantly feel cool.&nbsp; when you get mad, say 'john corkendorfer' and you will have no choice but to be happy.&nbsp; i got to see some people i hadnt seen all summer last night, which was nice.&nbsp; now i kind of want school to start so i can see some of my friends again.&nbsp; kind of.&nbsp; we just hung out all night really.&nbsp; we played catchphrase too.&nbsp; one word i got was 'chain', so i said ___ of fools, which nobody got, so then i started singing __, ___, ___, ___ of fools.&nbsp; i think everybody on the other team knew it, but nobody on my team did.&nbsp; heather seemed to enjoy my performance at least.&nbsp; if im going to make a fool of myself, somebody should at least get it right.&nbsp; another phrase i got was 'jake and the fat man'.&nbsp; i was like what the heck is this?&nbsp; i still have no idea.&nbsp; anyway, i got home late and still forced myself up early today&nbsp;to go golf.&nbsp; i got to the course around 7:30 and found that there was a tournament, so i had to go back home.&nbsp; i slept for a few hours after that.&nbsp; i woke up and my mom told me to go scrub the trash barrel.&nbsp; not sure when this became my job, but it smelled terrible.&nbsp; it was not a pleasant experience.&nbsp; such is life.&nbsp; after this i went with some people to see i robot (i had been delaying this movie for awhile since i thought it looked dumb).&nbsp; it actually wasnt bad at all.&nbsp; i was pleasantly surprised once again.&nbsp; then we went to chipotle. when we were outside eating we witnessed some road rage:&nbsp; 2 kids in a beat up crown vic were following some lady, and when she parked, they pulled up next to her.&nbsp; when she got out, they got out and started yelling and swearing at her.&nbsp; she was like 50 years old.&nbsp; i can understand yelling at a peer or something, but if you want to act tough, dont yell at an old lady.&nbsp; kids these days, they have no respect :)&nbsp; after this we went to codys and hung out.&nbsp; i played him in pingpong and i lost 21-10, 20-22 (1), 22-20 (1).&nbsp; it was a good match once i warmed up.&nbsp; he is the only person who ever beats me with any frequency, probably bc he plays tennis all the time and also bc he knows to hit to my backhand.&nbsp; so close. and thats my little update on my life over the past 2ish days.&nbsp; pictures are tomorrow at 10 am, so no golf in the morning.&nbsp; all the outfits are ready to go!&nbsp; i will let you know how it all turns out, and maybe post them if i can figure out how, at least once i get them back.&nbsp; until then...
i am sorry for the redundancy (ironic given the title...ha!) of writing about the 'cant live a day' remix of avalon by dj tiesto.&nbsp; i forgot i wrote about it the 1st time.&nbsp; anyway, i guess this means i like it a lot.&nbsp; i probably didnt even need to post this as nobody else would have noticed.&nbsp; oh well, i have satisfied myself and my oc (if you dont know what oc means, read this months archives).&nbsp; good night this time, for real!
there is so much good music out there that nobody knows about.&nbsp; today i stumbled upon andy hunter (actually i had heard of him, but i hadnt listened to him), who i guess is considered the #1 Christian dj, at least in the trance realm.&nbsp; good stuff...another song i found is a remix by none other than dj tiesto on the song 'cant live a day' by avalon.&nbsp; this is all on radiou's (Christian rock station in columbus) electrik cirkus (i think thats the spelling) playlist.&nbsp; theres a link to the radiou homepage in the sidebar (my favorite radio station),  urlLink here is one right here to the electrik thingy page .&nbsp; apparently they spell it electric circus...i could have sworn they did something weird w/ it...oh well.  i was thinking about what to do tomorrows top 5 on, so i turned to chad for help.&nbsp; since the topic will suck, you have him to blame.&nbsp; this is the 'eye' of the brainstorm...i just thought of that...that was pretty good, huh?  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; whats a good topic to do a top 5 type thing on?&nbsp;&nbsp;  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; movies?  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; i dont really like movies that much, remember?  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; oh yeha  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; um bands  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; something more interesting, w/ some oomph.&nbsp; as in oomph  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; k&nbsp;&nbsp;  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; strippers  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; shut up&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; lol&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm thinking. that was just to get the juices flowing  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; not very well  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; lol oh ty  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; something random other than strippers&nbsp;  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; lol &nbsp;  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; vegitable&nbsp;  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; k  so there you have it, i am doing my top 5 on 'vegitable(s)' tomorrow.&nbsp; goodnight!
this title has no significance to the post that i know of, i just wrote it.&nbsp; i feel obligated to title these things.&nbsp; anyway...yesterday we did not end up seeing the bourne supremacy bc they were out of tickets.&nbsp; so we went to codys and rented the bourne identity instead.&nbsp; i had forgotten how much i liked that movie.&nbsp; i heard the new one isnt quite as good, but its still pretty good.&nbsp; they went to see it today, but i couldnt bc i was golfing with my dad.&nbsp; i didnt play very well, but we had fun even though it took about 5 hours.&nbsp; i hate golfing weekends and afternoons bc it takes forever.&nbsp; a 5-hour round takes up the entire afternoon, but if you can sacrifice some sleep and tee off at 6:30, it takes 3 hours max, and nobody else is even awake, so you have the rest of the day free.&nbsp; i guess that in europe everybody plays 3 hour rounds, even foursomes.&nbsp; if i ever go to england, i will have to go play some golf there.&nbsp; it seems too good to be true. i went shopping yesterday for senior picture outfits as well as general wardrobe maintainance.&nbsp; i got a polo at j crew, its kind of cobalt blue with narrow white horizontal stripes, then a kelly green polo at gap, and a navy long sleeve button up shirt from ralph lauren.&nbsp; i think the last one is the only one im wearing for pictures, the other ones are just for some variety on the course.&nbsp; next up is a red or pink polo shirt, hopefully in time for tryouts.&nbsp; also i need a new hat to go with the kelly green shirt.&nbsp; i am thinking maybe a white visor w/ green accent, if i can find one.&nbsp; if you want to think of what you should do in this situation, i would be wearing very light khaki shorts with a brown leather belt, and black/brown alligator skin golf shoes w/ short black socks.&nbsp; in case you were wondering.&nbsp; actually i would greatly appreciate input on this.&nbsp; if i cant play well i should at least look good :) another great song i found really quick: cant live a day remix feat. dj tiesto- avalon.&nbsp; great great beat, get the song or album (o2: avalon remixed).&nbsp; later!
yesterday, i wasted about 6 hours of my day working on tech stuff at church.&nbsp; i was helping with a vbs followup service, and my responsibilities amounted to hitting play and stop on a dvd player.&nbsp; they could have had a kindergartner do it.&nbsp; then i helped 'tear down' aka winding up some cords.&nbsp; i did get to see some of my kids from camp though.&nbsp; one kid kept jumping off the stage onto me at the end, then he pretended that he hurt his ankle. little monster...i said if you keep doing that, your ankle is really going to hurt.&nbsp; all in good fun of course. i played 9 holes again today, and i feel fine, anklewise at least.&nbsp; i played so well, but i putted like...(trying to think of something that is bad at putting)...something bad at putting.&nbsp; have you ever had 4 3-putt bogeys in 9 holes? i did.&nbsp; another interesting fact:&nbsp;(follow closely, a bit confusing)&nbsp; i was as many over par on the holes where i hit the green in regulation as i was on the holes where i didnt hit the green in regulation (all you nongolfer types ignore that).&nbsp; anyway, i hit 6 out of 9 greens, had 20 putts (yes 20) and shot 42.&nbsp; very frustrating, but encouraging as far as ball striking was concerned. i think i am going to go see the bourne supremacy tonight, not sure when.&nbsp; i dont really like seeing non-comedy movies that much, but this looks pretty good.&nbsp; i will rate it tomorrow probably for you, since you respect my opinion so much. i got the u chicago 'uncommon' application (they are quite proud of this title) yesterday.&nbsp; i looked at the essays, and they are much better than the common app.&nbsp; not sure which one i am going to do.&nbsp; i can post them here, if you have any suggestions as far as which one i should do, feel free to drop a comment.&nbsp; here you go: i just looked at them again, they are too long to type, i will summarize. here we go again: 1) write an essay somehow inspired by super-huge mustard (like at sams club) 2) talk about how language sets people apart, covering peculiarities of your own personal language, how does it make you unique, etc. 3) 'any law that uplifts human personality in just, any law that degrades human personality is unjust' wrote mlk jr in 'letter from birm. jail'. give your thoughts on justice as it relates to 'human personality'. 4) i have already decided this is too confusing and not that interesting, so im not doing it.&nbsp; plus its about twice as long as any other essay, so i will not write it.&nbsp; apply to u chicago yourself if youre that desperate to see it 5) write your own essay question, like applicants did for # 1 and #2.  thats it.&nbsp; i am leaning towards 1 or 2.&nbsp; i think they can learn a lot more about an applicant this way than by saying 'how did you respond to an ethical dilemma' or 'who has had an impact on your life', so this application might actually be enjoyable. i downloaded a new song last night, called 'amazing' by george michael.&nbsp; its good, but nothing special.&nbsp; the preview only lets you hear the first 30 sec of the song, which were good, but the rest was kind of repetitive.&nbsp; i guess its a dance/pop mix, with very few vocals.&nbsp; its not a 'listen to on repeat' song for me though.
yes, this is my secret identity, i have been hiding it from you this whole time...just kidding! ha.&nbsp; not even tiger would have teed off when i did this morning.&nbsp; it was raining so hard.&nbsp; when i got there at 7:30 this morning (yes i cheated and set my alarm an hour later last night, i need to ease into this 5:44 stuff) everybody was hiding in the clubhouse from the rain or something.&nbsp; i was like to the manager 'can i go out?' and he was like 'i think its unplayable, but you can try if you want' and i was like 'whoa' and he was like 'woot'.&nbsp; after this dialog, i teed off in the rain, and since i didnt warm up and my hands were already wet, i kind of duffed the tee shot and the rest of the shots on that hole and i got an 8.&nbsp; it didnt help that there was a creek where there wasnt supposed to be 100 yards out with more tributaries than the nile river delta (i thought of that one when i was on the course.&nbsp; not bad, eh?)&nbsp; then the green was kind of flooded too.&nbsp; i got used to the rain after that, and i ended up shooting 45, which would have been decent to poor before injury, so i was quite encouraged.&nbsp; i didnt play that well, but i didnt play poorly either, so it was a successful round.&nbsp; i didnt get hurt at all, except on 9 i jumped up to see if i was on the green and i kind of forgot about my ankle.&nbsp; then i remembered it.&nbsp; its fine now though. so a good experience all in all. apparently i have to go do some technical stuff at church tonight for some kids service.&nbsp; i didnt learn about this until today, so i am a bit irritated, but its ok.&nbsp; later!
actually you would be better off reading one of the other post, not a whole lot to say.&nbsp; i am not relishing the thought of getting up at 5:44 tomorrow morning after about 3 weeks of sleeping in every morning.&nbsp; plus there are supposed to be thunderstorms, which according to my dad are incredibly deadly.&nbsp; if i get struck by lightning i would rather it be on a golf course.&nbsp; anyway, i like playing in the rain.&nbsp; i guess it makes me feel tougher than most other golfers (shut up, golfers are among the toughest people out there...sometimes we go 5 or 6 holes w/out a cart girl :) .&nbsp; seriously, though, i get a sense of pride and dedication when i play in a downpour, plus it is a change from the usual scorchiness.)  urlLink i have a link to a website i found today that i guess is sweeping the nation here. &nbsp; its jibjab.com or something.&nbsp; its basically making fun of kerry and bush, which gives it a wider&nbsp;appeal.&nbsp; quite funny imo, although its already gotten a little old.&nbsp; i would limit viewings to 5 or fewer personally.&nbsp; it has a little profanity, but that never killed anyone (i hope not at least). one other thing: is it even debatable that seinfeld is the best show ever on tv? it is the only show where i can still crack up even if ive seen it 3 or 4 times before (yes i just watched it on tbs: bless you ted turner...wow i never thought i would say that...please keep the reruns on forever!) i have to go to bed so early tonight its not funny.&nbsp; goodnight!
i dont have much time for this post (dinner) but since i might not be able to get back on tonight, here is my post in a nutshell...hit a jumbo bucket at the range today, and my ankle held up ok, so i am going to play at least 9 holes tomorrow (trembling w/ excitement) this means that you will once again be subject to me describing my rounds, but im sure you missed reading that as much as i missed writing it :) (sidenote:&nbsp; ironically when i was typing 'writing' i accidentally wrote 'writhing'...maybe its a subconcious impulse or something).&nbsp; so i am excited about that.&nbsp; i got my yale application in the mail today.&nbsp; i looked over it, i guess theyre part of the common app, which i kind of hate.&nbsp; the essay questions are so ridiculously stupid and broad that i have no idea what to write.&nbsp; these essays are everywhere, and i hate them.&nbsp; for my sat II writing test, i ended up writing about my friend sliding across my car hood in the rain like 'dukes of hazard' and denting it...come on, who wants to read this.&nbsp; then in 9th grade proficiency testing, i wrote about arthur (yes the tv show on pbs...whats wrong with that?).&nbsp; to summarize this, i hate non-specific essays.&nbsp; something should be done, like say 'write about an animal the same color as your favorite color and starts w/ the same letter as your first name and their experience at the fair' or something like that (shut up, you try and think of something specific and relevant)...this parenthetical statement kind of justifies the broad essay...ack. one more thing, it has been an incredible last 2 days being a fantasy baseball owner w/ travis hafner on the squad...5 hr and 11 rbi last 2 games means i am moving up in my division w/out having my pitchers play (2 starters pitch tomorrow)...this last section is not b/c anybody cares about my fantasy baseball (trust me...i have never found anybody that cares about this other than my 10th grade english teacher...), i am just excited that a 1B is outproducing most pitchers.&nbsp; so yes, thats about it, and im going to go eat.&nbsp; until the next post...
today was much more relaxing than yesterday, except not being able to get to sleep until 4:30 (i think i talked about that last post).&nbsp; i hit a large bucket today at the range, and i felt fine.&nbsp; i think thursday is still a realistic target for playing at least 9 holes.&nbsp; i got home and got on AIM, and i guess chee is staying at her sisters boss house, so i got to talk to the boss' daughter, naomi.&nbsp; we talked for about 3 hrs straight, she is one of the most fascinating people i have ever talked to...plus she is a huge college football fan (i am in heaven!).&nbsp; after dinner i decided to rearrange my room according to the plan i drew up in my mind last night while trying to get to sleep.&nbsp; moving the stuff is kind of hard by yourself, but i managed.&nbsp; it didnt turn out quite like i was hoping, but it looks pretty good imo.&nbsp; i just needed a change.&nbsp; that took about 2 hrs, so now i am at the computadora again.&nbsp; i just discovered paul van dyk, another trance artist kind of like dj tiesto.&nbsp; this genre is pretty new to me, but if all trance is like this, wow is all i can say.&nbsp; incredible stuff.&nbsp; where would music be w/out scandinavians?&nbsp; (i am swedish-ish so i can say this w/out being racist)&nbsp; i need to go out and continue our tradition or something.&nbsp; i actually talked to chad about bringing back our band (retalliation of the lamp...i guess its more or less trance now that i think about it), so im going to call lucarse when he gets back from soccer camp.&nbsp; yes, and then we can tour the world while were at it :) 'thank you, goodnight' -all star united, as well as probably a lot of other people
last night i went to bed around midnight but didnt end up sleeping until 4:20.&nbsp; so i got some thinking done.&nbsp; i was looking around my room for paper, and i came across a notebook that i wrote in last time this happened.&nbsp; i enjoyed reading it, so i decided to post them.&nbsp; keep in mind that i had just finished reading a 1000 page book about the last 500 years of society and civilization and how we are at the end of an age (called 'from dawn to decadence' by jacques barzun, very slow read, but fascinating), so these might reflect on that.&nbsp; its basically just observations. machiavelli's 'might makes right' (this might have actually been nietzche, not sure) makes truth arbitrary. as long as God is the standard of truth, i see no problem with this.&nbsp; although truth is within God, i see no problem with saying God defines truth by defining Himself. &nbsp; tradition is undervalued in society.&nbsp; people want only to preserve themselves, not themselves in relationship to others, which is what tradition is. &nbsp; spending a half-hour a day smiling when you dont feel like it will do you more good than all the money in the world. (not sure about that one) &nbsp; if people say that shorthand caused the death of penmanship, i would argue that it creates a written language all its own. &nbsp; neatness is not necessarily having an appearance of utter cleanliness, but more a knowledge as to the whereabouts of any involved object at any given time. &nbsp; randomness is never really random at all, at least pertaining to humans.&nbsp; rather it is spawned from a desire to be separate from the expected, and, more importantly, an all-encompassing view of the expected. &nbsp; an understanding of the entire self is impossible.&nbsp; when you search for&nbsp;a cretain facet of yourself, you rarely find it, but instead learn many unexpected things. &nbsp; there are more, but they arent&nbsp;that interesting to me.&nbsp; im not sure how i feel about all of these now, but i thought that they were at least worth posting.
I CAN HIT A GOLF BALL AGAIN!&nbsp; yes!!! according to the calendar it has only been 13 days since i could last do this, but it seems like months.&nbsp; i cant tell you how ecstatic i was.&nbsp; i was in the backyard working on my backswing with my dad and he said, 'why dont you try a slow weight shift and see how it feels', so i did, and it felt fine.&nbsp; i then worked up to a full hard swing, and that didnt hurt either, so i went to the range immediately and hit a bucket of balls.&nbsp; i was a little rusty, but that was to be expected.&nbsp; my goal is to hit every day this week and hopefully i can play a full round by thursday.&nbsp; this feels like my whole summer has been reborn.&nbsp; plus i found out tryouts are a week later than i thought they were, so optimism is permeating my being (not usually the case). that was in the evening.&nbsp; the rest of my day sucked.&nbsp; i slept in and when i got up, i read some more hunchback of ND.&nbsp; then i went to the library to see if some cds i wanted to burn were in yet.&nbsp; however, when i got there, i felt extremely nauseous.&nbsp; i left and flew home just in time to throw up in my own toilet.&nbsp; i went through 3 series of this, which was accompanied by a throbbing headache.&nbsp; it was one of those situations where, although you know you will get better pretty soon, you are so miserable that you wish you were dead. at chads yesterday, we ordered out some indian food, which looked nasty, but i figured it was ok to eat.&nbsp; i am blaming this for my illness.&nbsp; after being sick, i took a nap for a couple of hours, and i feel pretty good now, but i am taking it easy, and im going to go to bed early tonight. another good thing about today (this was actually like 2 AM this morning, which i guess counts as today) is that i downloaded a couple more sweet songs.&nbsp; my new 'repeat for a week until i get sick of it' song is 'last train home' by lostprophets.&nbsp; i heard this on the radio like a month ago, so&nbsp;i decided to get it, and it is sweet.&nbsp; the other song i got is 'ocean avenue' by yellowcard.&nbsp; my friends are obsessed with the band, so i checked them out.&nbsp; not a particularly original sound, but i like the sound anyway, so it was another good find/whatever you call it.

i enjoyed watching todd hamilton win the british open, its hard not to be happy for someone like him.&nbsp; i would have liked to have seen phil win (i am not a bandwagon fan, he has been my favorite ever since when i was 6, my 1st visit to the memorial tournament, when i found out he was a lefty (like me)-just for the record), but anyway, hamilton held up very very well.&nbsp;i cant imagine how nervous he was when els was birdieing everything at the end.&nbsp; but how does this major record look:masters: 1stus open: 2ndbritish o: 3rdat the beginning of the yr, would you have said that belongs to phil mickelson?&nbsp; any guesses on what he will get at the pga?&nbsp; i will say 4th, just for patterns sake :)after watching the playoff, i went to get my suit for senior pics.&nbsp; no armani, but it is nice enough.&nbsp; i can pick it up tuesday after alterations.&nbsp; im not overly excited for the pics, but it has to be done.&nbsp; i think they will turn out ok (hopefully).after this i went over to chads and helped him hook up a new computer and install stuff on it.&nbsp; aim wont work though, bc of some stupid popup blocker.&nbsp; we didnt really do anything, just messed around and talked (mainly about his vacation).&nbsp; it was nice to see him again (not like i ever go more than a week w/out seeing him).&nbsp; i was going to go to youth group at heritage with the youngs, but they didnt have it this week.&nbsp; pity...i wanted to play in the tournament tomorrow, but my parents wont let me.&nbsp; its probably for the best, as i would embarass myself, but i really want to start again!&nbsp; i should stop posting these gripes, but its what is currently going on in my mind, so i guess i wont :)&nbsp; i believe thats all ive got for now!'follow the day and reach for the sun!'-the polyphonic spree (light and day) seriously, this is the coolest song ever! at least for the next week until i get sick of it.&nbsp;
people are finally coming back from vacation!  chad got back last night from the carribean, and cody and phil just got back from nc.  keith is done with his fair (i guess he is the #4 western rider in the country!  did not know that...).  and then, a big surprise, my friend from elementary school that left in 6th grade to florida has moved to louisville, so we are going to do something soon.  maybe a reds game b/c thats kind of in between.  this is quite exciting, i havent seen him in about 4 yrs :) so now i can stop sitting around moping about the ankle (its getting better i think, but i still cant do a full swing).  i got invited to the final 'championship' tournament for the league that im in on monday.  i guess its only for the top people in the league, so im not sure why i was invited (oh wait, the league kind of sucks), but i cant go anyway.  what a pity... :) last nights thing at church went well enough.  austin was there, and he remembered me.  there was a little drama between he and a girl there who was listening to hilary duff on headphones and let out random shrieks a lot (very high on the unintentional comedy scale).  the tension was eventually diffused, so the night was altogether enjoyable. i forced myself out of bed this morning so i could watch some of the british open.  it honestly wasnt that interesting to watch.  i was glad to see phil and tiger making moves.  i used to hate tiger, but i feel kind of bad for him now (plus he signed 2 autographs for me at the memorial tournament).  sidenote: todd hamilton (the leader after 3 rounds) i actually picked him for fantasy golf during the us open.  grr...wrong tournament.  that really isnt that relevant... i have read about the first 100 pgs of hunchback of notre dame.  talk about a slow starting story...after the first 30 pages it picks up, but i was worried.  another annoying thing is that there are about 5 other languages interjected into the book, and i only remotely know one of them (french).  but it is getting more interesting as the story progresses. well, i am going to early church tomorrow so i can see more of the open, so goodnight!
(that means obligatory/compulsory) (which means it seems to be what youre supposed to do)  as i blog surf at times, i notice a lot of '100 facts about me' posts, so i figured i would go for it.  enjoy  1. i am already intimidated by this 2. i am pretty shy unless i feel comfortable 3. i despise small talk 4. i can honestly say that i like all music (except country, which imo doesnt qualify as music) 5. i actually do believe that track is a sport (sorry cody) 6. i think going to the movies w/ friends and doing nothing else is a waste of time 7. i think that college football and nfl are 2 completely different sports (w/ college vastly superior) 8. there is not 1 team in ncaa football that i do not hate other than ohio state.  honestly, i have gone over this many different ways. 9. i get bit by mosquitoes more than anyone i know 10. i have difficulty saying no to other peoples requests 11. i have noticed that by saying yes, good things happen (usually) 12. i am a bigger tipper than either of my parents 13. this is b/c i know what it is like to have a job that depends on tips 14. this is also b/c i dont have a mortgage to pay 15. i absolutely love going to rock concerts 16. my first time crowd surfing was the most exhilarating experience i have ever had (until i got dropped) 17. i believe everything happens for a reason 18. if you keep an open mind and have perspective, you can usually get an idea of this reason pretty easily 19. this saves you time by cutting self-pity significantly 20. i should listen to my own medicine 21. i cannot live with myself when someone is mad at me 22. i have only had one person in my life absolutely abhor me 23. it was a middle school teacher 24. one day in class, i was kidding around with my friends and quoted some Bible verse about humility.  she walked up behind me, and said 'why dont you practice what you preach, mr. nordman?' 25. i still have no idea why she hated me 26. i have difficulty accepting complements 27. i feel that by accepting complements (about my intelligence mainly) i am taking credit for that which i did not do b/c God made me this way 28. then when i say 'its a gift from God' or something like that, i feel corny and kind of rude as well 29. i guess there are worse dilemmas in the world 30. i am getting a little stressed about college applications starting soon 31. i have not yet been motivated to start this stuff 32. once i get motivated i should be fine 33. except for the interviews 34. i hope that the interviews are not phone, b/c i hate talking on the phone other than w/ friends 35. i already did a phone interview w/ an MIT guy, and i spent an hour listening to him talk about cryogenic freezing research. 36. i felt like an idiot after i hung up, b/c i was not impressive, i am sure 37. i dont think i will have to worry about going to MIT now 38. my mom saw my senior schedule and told me what she could remember 39. it appears quite difficult 40. my 1st semester is govt/econ, h. calculus, Bible, study hall, internship 41. that will be my 1st study hall ever 42. semester 2 is h. physics, french 4, h. english 12, Bible, and something else 43. i am glad i am a fast reader 44. i am proud of myself i made it so far w/out mentioning golf 45. oops, i just did 46. (this was obviously pre-planned, since i could have deleted that) 47. most people dont get my sense of humor until they know me for about 3 months 48. it is very dry and fairly sarcastic 49. i like it, but the drawback is that people never believe you when youre actually serious 50. i wish that i could vote this year 51. i missed out by less than 2 months 52. this means i wont be able to vote for a president until i am 21. 53. i guess 1 vote probably doesnt matter 54. that is just a fact, not some unpatriotic statement deserving of execution on a basis of treason 55. my number 1 pet peeve is apostrophe misuse 56. this is ironic as i never use apostrophes on this blog 57. i guess it is the ignorance as related to the misuse, like putting an apostrophe in 'visit one of our store's' (actually seen at sportmart at sawmill) 58. another annoyance is people finishing my sentences constantly 59. the people that do this actually do not know what i want to say 60. actually this is more or less one person that does this 61. obviously it is not less than one person 62. i like to find humor in little things and ironies 63. i often wonder why gangsta rap has any appeal to suburban white kids, but it does 64. my friend went to maine, and apparently most of the teenagers there are kind of like b-rad in malibus most wanted 65. they call themselves 'maineacs' 66. i can bluff really well when it comes to whether or not i have seen something like a tv show/movie 67. all you have to do is pick up little details/scenes from previews/commercials and throw them into a conversation, and nobody will suspect that you havent seen it 68. this is what i did w/ malibus most wanted 69. it works, doesnt it? 70. my dream career would be an investment banker on wall st 71. this is not what i had in mind in kindergarten 72. back then i wanted to be a carpenter, a pga pro, and somebody who goes around in a mickey costume at disneyworld 73. i dont think any of those dreams will come to fruition 74. i am completely fine with that 75. i am glad that i was more or less oblivious to pop culture during the 80s 76. everything about that decade seems hideous 77. that is another music 'style' i dont like, i guess (80s stuff, like journey...shudder) 78. i do however like livin' on a prayer by bon jovi ('86) 79. that is it though. 80. i think that the 'best of the 80s, 90s, and today' radio stations might as well be 'best of classical, rap, and heavy metal' stations for all the similarities in the 3 genres. 81. i consider myself to be very introspective 82. i would be willing to bet that this is a common sentiment among teenagers 83. this is b/c introspection is part of 'finding your identity' which is what all teenagers have to do 84. i like to think of 'introspection' as an 'introduction to inspection' which means its the first time you have seriously thought about anything of consequence 85. there are obviously exceptions to this, but its a general rule 86. another thing that i dislike immensly is the whole feminist movement 87. i am all for equal rights/pay/etc, but the rest of the movement is such a joke. they have such a chip on their shoulders, its annoying.  the 'us v. the world' attitude is not going to win much support imo 88. they believe that they are better than men, which kind of discredits their whole position, that of gender equality 89. i just thought of that last one :) 90. i had another good one, but i forgot it 91. i always sing along with my radio when i am driving alone 92. i also sing when my friends are in the car with me 93. this seems to annoy them 94. i cannot wait to get away from ohio and go to college 95. my life here is fine, i just want to go live on my own and kind of start over 96. this is why i swear to myself that i wont go to ohio state (that plus the fact that its huge) 97. i will not however stay away from ohio stadium for the rest of my life (or the rest of columbus for that matter) 98. whenever i pass it on the freeway (315) i salute it (completely serious) 99. i can give you 100 reasons why OSU-michigan is the #1 rivalry in sports (if i remember, this will be my top 5 blog for michigan week) 100. i did this whole thing in 1 sitting! ha 101. not all of these were actually about me...youve been scammed! :)  that is it, hopefully you know a little more about me (other than 'this is an awkward subject') :) a quick golf clap for paul casey and thomas levet who share the british open lead (probably not the case by the time you read this).  believe it or not, levet was in that playoff in the open 2 yrs ago when ernie els won.  so he can play. casey might have been ryder cup for the brits, not sure on that (i dont care that much, so i wont look it up...for now) tomorrow i am helping out with the disabled kids at church.  hopefully austin is there :) unfortunately, we always play kickball or soccer over there, and i cant do that.  we can figure something out.  goodnight!
actually its just me.  i am an army of one...sorry. ironically i just got another solicitation from the army today.  i guess they havent noticed that i have never responded to them.  i can think of a good way for bush to cut military spending a little...stop sending this stuff out! i finished rebecca today...over 200 pages.  when i get going, i dont stop.  it got so much better over the last half of the book.  the first half is kind of dull b/c it is all setup, but i think that its all necessary.  very very riveting finish, although the ending (last page only) is disappointing.  i will now recommend it to the majority of the populace.  next up is the hunchback of notre dame.  i think i saw a wishbone about this before (actually i know i did).  it shouldnt take very long. just got a new job today.  once my ankle heals, i am going to go pass out fliers/flyers (not sure on spelling, at least i can be half right)  for my neighbors computer something or other business (once i get more info, i can solicit customers for him on my blog :))  $10 an hr, plus good exercise (sounds kind of like single bag caddying, except i know that i will be working every time i try). not much else to say, except that i have once again dug out relient ks sophomore release (the anatomy of the tongue in cheek) and it is still incredible (for more on this subject, please see my top 5 blog.) thundercats, whoah!
i am not really in a posting mood tonight.  i am very tired, which makes me grumpy/irritable, which i have been tonight.  i did in fact get ncaa football 2005 today (a dumb purchase since i will have to get 2006 next year in preparation for college), and it is a very incredible game.  the sound is so much better, there is no comparison.  there are other new things, like actual sports illustrated covers for dynasty, plus 'greatest game' scenarios ('97 rose bowl, '03 fiesta bowl, who won both of them?  thats what i thought :)  the only dumb thing is that both of those you are supposed to beat ohio state.  the anti-buckeye sentiment pops up again (this is a theme among the buckeye faithful that will be mentioned a lot more as football season approaches...wow, less than 2 months, that just hit me (trembling with anticipation)).  the one annoying thing (this will turn into more than 1, trust me) is that the playbook changed, and i was so used to 2003, so it is a bit confusing.  also it is always kind of hard to learn a new game, so it can be frustrating.  all of this paragraph to say that i like the game very much.  if you like college football (who couldnt?) get it. i did in fact get to go chip at the driving range today.  i got a small bucket and went through it a few times until my ankle started to hurt a little, and then i left the balls there (biggest waste of $4.50 ever).  also contributing to my early departure was an old guy that was chipping from a pot bunker directly across from me.  very disconcerting.  i did however develop a new shot, a low spinner that you bank into a hill of rough just in front of the green.  this is a pretty common shot, but i have never tried it before.  i got it to become somewhat effective, just need to practice more... i had a big scare today.  my dad noticed that fluffy jr. (one of my goldfish) was belly up in my fishbowl, but when he tapped it, he came to.  he seems to be fine now (knock on wood, cross fingers, etc), but that scared me to death, and put me in a worse mood.  my fish are almost 3, which is pretty old i believe.  i know death is inevitable, but i have grown quite attached to them.  every time a pet dies, i swear i wont get another one, but i always do. speaking of the british open, i guess it starts in about 2 hrs.   urlLink here is a convenient link to the leaderboard. . i dont think i have any more post in me.  i have to go rest up so i can go do nothing tomorrow.  stupid ankle...
not sure why i am even posting anything now, probably just out of habit i guess.  the allstar game kind of sucked, as it was never really a game.  it was cool to see the AL hit for the cycle in the 1st inning, thats about it.  since it wasnt really worth watching, i watched outback jack (speaking of not really worth watching).  it was at least better than other 'love' reality shows like the bachelor crap.  they use the hanging suspense stuff way too much though.  it doesnt work as well when its that blatantly obvious (another good example: the davinci code-of course i would say that book sold ok-i still find it insulting to my intelligence). other than my fascinating tv watching, nothing much happened today, so thats about all i have to post.  no great insights either, and most importantly: no obsessive compulsive thing i have to talk about here!  except listening to my new 'repeat' song-'light and day' by none other than the polyphonic spree.  their new album just came out (together were heavy), trust me it is incredible.  listening to a song on repeat is not obsessive compulsive (henceforth OC, i am sick of typing that)...right?  yeah... sidenote: i love whoever invented ace bandages!  the most comfortable form of support i can find, and a lot cheaper too.  that about covers it...goodnight!
urlLink here is a link to my new top 5 blog.  (there is also a link on the sidebar). i did basically nothing today other than get my haircut.  i read about 100 pages of rebecca, which is becoming, to my horror, actually enjoyable.  i am borderline recommending it.  life is kind of boring when i cant golf, plus most of my friends are on vacation this week (this always happens, they go different places, but all at the same time...its a conspiracy).  i played ncaa football 2003 for the first time in almost a year i think.  i realized it was set on 'jv' (very easy) when i ran the opening kickoff back for a td. i think 2005 comes out this week, and i am somewhat inclined to go get it.  i should sleep on it. i think i am going to head out to the range tomorrow to chip if nothing else.  i might try a few swings if i feel up to it. thats about all i have to post for today.  i am going to go watch the allstar game in a bit (go AL! since the tigers are going to make good use of home field advantage when they make the world series...a little baseball humor there).  i might post again later tonight, just wait and see!
just an update on my basic blog format: i have created a separate blog for my top 5.  i will still update it every sunday, and i can put a link to it on this page.  i did this so it would be easier to access all of the archives of top 5 posts so you can be enlightened faster :)  if this completely angers you and would cause you to boycott this blog, feel free to comment, but i probably wont listen anyway. -later
in case you hadnt noticed i updated my profile to include this among my interests.  anyway, i decided to check out my last question (find a word from A G O S) in the handy dictionary and i answered my own question again!  wow, who needs other people when you have yourself...everybody.  so...the word is:  SAGO \'sa-(,)go\ n: a dry granulated or powdered starch prepared from the pith of a sago palm ad used in foods and as testuile stiffening (with thanks to our friends at webster)  how on earth am i supposed to know that this is a word?  just thought i would update you on this so you arent kept up all night fretting about this. p.s. the british open (apparently now 'the open championship' starts thursday! :')  let us hope for a successful title defense by the local boy ben curtis!  sidenote:  i play at his familys course all the time, and i got to hold and kiss the claret jug last year!  quite the experience...i have pics but they arent digital.  in case you were wondering.  now that i have peace of mind, off for some more physical therapy...this post was longer than i meant it to be.  anyhow, good night!
yes this is the title of the song i was looking for last post.  once i posted i thought 'why dont i just look for myself?', and lo and behold, i found it in about 1 minute (google search for 'hp commercial' + pictures).  it is called 'pictures of you' by none other than the cure (i knew it sounded familiar).  i actually found it on some message board about commercials...did not know of such things...no further comment.  anyway, its a pretty old song, but it is very catchy...hp gets great songs for its commercials, there is another one that i like, i am not going to search for it bc there arent any words to search for, but someone in the marketing dept deserves a raise (no my dad does not work there). went to the doctor today, he confirmed that it is a severe sprain, and that the earliest i could hit balls is in about a week, which would leave me with about 2 weeks to get into peak form for the beginning of the season...i wish this wasnt going to be my senior year bc i dont want to go out on a negative.  who knows, maybe it wont be, but 2 weeks without golfing is not helpful at all.  if i had to be injured, i would almost rather it be right before season so i would have a tangible excuse for the inevitable regression of my game that will occur (sorry about the bout of verbosity, i have to warm up for school coming up fairly soon...ack).  anyway, i would like to go chip and putt at the driving range maybe starting weds or thurs, who knows.  this is really making my summer more difficult than what i had planned.  my game seemed to be coming around, too...yes, i am quite despondent here.  its just that i have done the exact same thing every summer since after 8th grade (golf/caddy more or less every day and get about 100 rounds in each yr), and i really enjoyed that whole routine, especially now that i can drive.  now i have to otherwise entertain myself, and the only big positive is that i can sleep in.  i really hope that some higher purpose for this incident manifests itself soon, bc i am kind of annoyed about my situation. tomorrow i go to get my pre-senior pictures haircut.  thankfully i got my mom to schedule it about 2 weeks (a common time period for this post) before pics, bc i absolutely hate how i look for about a week after my haircut.  i guess that is pretty common actually.  speaking of senior pics, i have to go get a suit soon...i am plugging for armani! (what do you mean, $400 could be better spent on college?...) in addition to finding that song by the cure, another band i stumbled upon today (w/ a new release) was the polyphonic spree.  its kind of a rock group with a 20ish person choir.  very unique sound.  i had heard one song 'light and day' before, but i didnt know who it was.  i absolutely love them... urlLink check them out, you can listen to most of their songs on their website . i read a good chunk of 'rebecca' today (summer reading requirement) and it has gotten more interesting than the beginning.  its obviously written by a woman (not meant as degradation, i just noticed quite a few details/sentiments/other fantasies that no man i know would think of let alone write.  i will let you know how it progresses. one more thing:  if anybody can tell me a word made up of the letters A G O S, i would be grateful.  i cannot come up with the word at all, i even wrote down all 24 possible combinations, and none of them seem like words to me.  i am obviously missing something, and this will bother me until i figure it out.  help?? until tomorrow...
what to post, what to post?  i wont bore you with all of my ankle information like health updates/rehab endeavors/etc, as that seems to be an oft mocked activity of the older set.  i am going to go see a doctor tomorrow to see what i should be doing to help it as well as to find out when i can start golfing again (within a week, please!).  if i am able to caddy anytime soon, i would assume that it would just be single bagging, which is hardly worth it, honestly.  this would make for a very down year financially for me.  i think i need to get a job with set hours instead of spending 3 hrs a day wishing i could do something to get paid.  on the other hand, $120 for 4.5 hrs work is very good money for a 17-year old.  on the first hand, i can only caddy about 3 months out of the year...quite the dilemma.  i will get back to you on this as soon as i get back to myself first. as i watched the trading spaces special tonight (quite interesting, especially finding out frank is married...to a woman) i found myself wondering what happened to vern.  he was my favorite designer on the show, but they didnt profile him, and i havent seen him on any new shows in quite a while.  does anybody know if he quit or left or anything?  that would disappoint me quite a bit. another thing that was brought to my attention at camp had to do with movies.  an 8-year old kid spent half the camp talking to me about dodgeball and all the disgusting stuff like the pizza and the pump thing that ben stiller used (in addition to michael jacksons escapades).  i asked him when he saw it, and he said he went to it with his dad.  honestly people, there is a reason these movies have ratings on them!  an 8-year old should not be seeing this stuff and getting their minds screwed up by this (although its completely fine for a 17-year old...hmm, this will probably be my 'lying in bed, cant get to sleep thought of the night' as i turn it over in my mind, which is something i do a lot).  anyway, i just wonder why some people dont take this stuff into consideration when they are shocked that little 15-year old junior gets an std or something.  they are getting this stuff fed to them from early childhood.  just a preachy opinion of mine to mull over if you wish.  actually, i havent fully considered this topic, so i am still open to changing my stance. one more thing:  a couple of months ago, there was a commercial for hp where there were kind of action photos and then photos were added to parts of them but they still fit (not much of a description, i know).  anyway, there was a song that had something to do with pictures, something like 'the picture was all that i knew', along those lines.  that was an awesome song, but i cant find it, and i want to get that song or cd.  if anybody knows what it was, please please tell me.  i will be forever indebted to you as well, so you will have got that going for you.  i am off to do more therapy...ever try writing the alphabet in capital letters with your big toe 10 times a day?  i hope not, bc it definitely sucks.  goodnight!
yes this is edition 2 of the weekly top 5.  this is a big step towards consistency, as i have not yet forgotten about this.  about 2 more of these and i would think that this will have been solidified as a definite 'department' of the blog.  without much further ado, this weeks top 5 is: 'things i heard the most at camp'  5) 'hows it going, hoppy?'    according to camp lore, hoppy is some guy from 100 years ago who was made fun of bc he had a curved spine and a short leg.  to make a long story short, he was found dead in a cave, frozen to death while clutching a fawn to keep it warm.  since i was kind of hopping around (w/ crutches) this nickname was bestowed upon me, and it spread quite quickly.  it could be worse i guess.  4) 'hows the ankle?'    pretty self-explanatory...as you hear this question more and more, you kind of get a default answer without many details once you realize that they dont want to know that badly.  3) 'i have to pee'    to be expected w/ 3rd grade guys.  we had a buddy system, which grew much more relaxed as the week progressed.  my response went from 'get your buddy' to 'just go in the woods or something'.  peeing in the woods is part of the camp experience, right?  2) 'my (insert authority figure, usually male, such as dad/grandpa) can (insert impressive feat that is usually doubled in exaggeration)'    as covered yesterday, these kids still idolize their parents/whoever else.  some of these stories were obviously fabricated, some were probably true.  another fun thing that came up a lot about parents was personal information such as diets/weight/age of parents.  these parents might want to rethink telling the kids this stuff... 1) 'what did you do to your ankle?/how did you manage THAT?'    imagine telling about 100 people (literally) that your injury was from something as dumb as jumping off of a slide from 1 foot off the ground.  i would have liked my injury to have been from something a bit more respectable, maybe i dived into the pool to save a kid from drowning or something like that.  humility is a good thing...  there you have it.  i am off to watch some us olympic trials for track & field now, then a 2-hour special on trading spaces!  (yes i am quite serious, i happen to enjoy that show, and no, this does not mean i am gay)  some of the designers on the other hand...
yes, i am now back from my counseloring?  experience at summer camp, and it was good for the most part.  however, it was a lot different than i had envisioned it being.  about 3 hrs into the camp i sprained my ankle (and, even though about 200 people already asked me how, i will tell you anyway...we were on a playground, and i was going down a slide with some of the kids.  it wasnt very slippery, so i got stuck at the bottom.  this was not a big problem, so i hopped off the slide from about 1 foot off the ground, but i rolled my ankle when i landed, and i heard a really loud pop.  i tried to walk it off for a few seconds, but it hurt too much, so i just flopped on the ground and had somebody get the nurse.  i tried hopping back, but it was kind of far, so i ended up piggybacking on jordan (another counselor type) to the nurses office(yes, i owe you one, shut up :) ).  anyway, i went to the ER and i got crutches and an air cast, and i felt good enough to stay (even though i couldnt put any pressure on it, i didnt want to disappoint my kids).  let me tell you, a summer camp in the woods with a bunch of hills and steps is not the place to have to use crutches.  they are fun to play with, but they suck when you need to use them.  i saw myself in a mirror for the first time since tuesday, and i have all of these bruise marks around my armpits from them.  stupid crutches...  i think my injury could have been a lot worse, especially with the pop i heard.  i thought it was a ligament, which would require surgery, and since i could not move my foot at all, it was quite possible.  personally, and you dont have to agree, but i believe that God healed me enough that i would be able to stay.  i figured that there would be a reason that it had happened to me, and it turns out that there was.  one girl was homesick, so the director had me talk to her, and she ended up staying and having a good time. other than that, camp was awesome.  i was worried that the kids wouldnt warm up to me immediately, but they loved me (always a good feeling :) ), and they listened to me for the most part.  i was planning on messing around with them and running around a lot, but i obviously couldnt very well, but that opened some doors for more personal interaction.  i taught some of them how to play euchre (kind of...they still dont get following suit...thats like the easiest concept in the game...they got the whole bauer thing).  they all helped me with my crutches and held doors and whatnot, and when i got back from ER late at night, austin (the autistic one that i was supposed to help) had put a pillow and sheet on a spare bunk as a bed for my crutches.  i was quite touched. the kids got along pretty well.  they were kind of annoyed with austin bc he made a lot of noises and so forth at night which kept them awake, but they didnt really understand him that well, which is to be expected.  if you can understand him, he is just the sweetest kid...as you can imagine with 3rd grade boys, the expulsion of gas is quite the hilarity.  one night somebody did this when we were at a campfire, and everyone started falling over themselves laughing.  then austin said 'i bet Jesus is up there laughing in heaven!'  it kind of made me wish i was a dad in a way.  there was only one other major conflict in the cabin, sort of an alpha-male thing that was never really resolved, only dissuaded, but i guess that can be expected as well.  i just cant explain how much i loved interacting with the kids and how they accepted you unconditionally and how i was kind of like their hero.  it felt really good.  i guess they are still at the age when authorities in their lives are still figures to be looked up to.  i was surprised how often they were bragging about dads/grandpas/whoever being incredible in some form.  i guarantee that in 4 or 5 years they will be complaining about how annoying/stupid they are...such is life. my body is kind of beat up (not just my ankle).  my armpits are bruised, my shoulders are sunburnt, i have a million (give or take) mosquito bites, and my back is quite itchy.  throw in 2 brief showers and no shampoo over 5 days and a bath becomes quite appealling (sp?...i am tired).  sorry, i had to complain about this...anyway, it was more than worth it though.  i made some new friends among the counselors (even though i already knew them), and they were all really nice even though my injury was a bit of an inconvenience.  so yes, i thoroughly enjoyed camp.  at the end, my counselor asked me if i would do this all over again, and i said without a doubt. the one negative now is that i am going to be kind of bored until the ankle heals somewhat, as i cant golf or caddy right now.  i had to cancel mondays tournament.  the golf season starts in about 3 weeks, so i have to get better in about a week if i want to have any chance to get in good form...this kind of sucks.  at least i can finish some summer reading.  i will probably be posting more jewels about camp over the next week or so, as this is quite the long post and i forgot a lot of the stuff i wanted to write.  i will close with another 'austin one-liner'. somebody else was making up a story or something, so he said,   'liar, liar, plants for hire!'  kids say the darnedest things!
actually that is tomorrow.  false alarm... the tournament today went ok.  the course was pretty short (cumberland trail, not cumberland like i said last post), but it was tough.  a lot of of fairway bunkers (trust me, i would know) and the greens were annoyingly fast (i believe 12 on the stimp or so...very very fast to the casual golfer such as myself).  so i limped home to an 88, which was good enough for 4th place.  the field was a bit stronger this week, and 77 won it.  it was very hot and not cloudy AT ALL during the round (this will come into play soon). after this round i wanted to go see if i could get rid of my golfers tan (very abrupt lines just above elbows and knees, around feet, right wrist (golf glove and matching rubber band line), neck, sunglasses, and a less noticable one across the forehead from my hat) at the pool, so i went over to chads house to go to the pool at medallion.  of course it was a perfect day for tanning as the sun was nothing if not stifling and generally hot during golf.  however, during the 4 or 5 minute drive to the pool, the weather went from sprinkling to torrential downpour with sheets of rain and no visibility at 30 mph.  so we turned around and just hung out for a while.  about an hour later it was clear again...stupid ohio weather...so we got to go to the pool for a couple of hours.  thankfully i didnt see anyone i knew.  i am still going to be quite pale at camp (2-3 hrs of pool time every day...ack). not much else to say, i will not be able to post probably until saturday or sunday...aha!  i just watched william hungs video for 'we are the champions'!  good stuff...i think he has gotten a little bit better, but he kind of sucks...i feel really bad for him.  i am all for some patronizing, but people usually know when i am messing with them.  to be so naive is quite remarkable.  he sure isnt going broke though...only in america i guess.  have a wonderful week, and develop some coping methods to deal with my absence early in the week as opposed to late...sorry :)
i have just had a revolutionary concept...every sunday i will give you my opinion on my personal top 5 somethings.  this is very tentative, and it is more than possible that this will be the only one.  with that in mind, the first category is...music albums!  these are all from the last 7 or so years, so there was never really consideration for any classic albums.  as you can see, most of these albums are from my favorite bands, which is no coincidence.  without further ado, here are my top 5...  5. a rush of blood to the head- coldplay    i got this cd last year, and i listened to it on my way to every golf match...its very calming, and i love every track from 1-7. 4. just be- tiesto    this is that new (to me at least) trance album i have been raving about.  the best song on it is by far the 1st track (forever today), which is probably in the top 5 songs (hint hint) for me.  who says the london club scene is weak?  i think he is the #1 dj in the world...heady stuff. 3. e-majn- cloud2ground    another incredible techno/trance album.  this is what got me addicted to the trance/indie thing.  the best 2 tracks are #1 (raindown) and #6 (face2face)- which is the most beautiful song i have heard (other than amazing grace on bagpipes and possibly lee greenwoods 'God bless the usa')  anyway, its an awesome album, except i dont really like the last 2 tracks.  the 1st 7 are incredible 2. the anatomy of the tongue in cheek- relient k    this is the most diverse album up here.  they always have a couple of goofy songs on their album, the difference here is that those songs are really sweet (im lion-o, may the horse be with you).  i also love the raw emotion in these words are not enough and for moments when i feel faint, and down in flames and failure to excommunicate are awesome as well.  the fact that this is not their most recent album yet it makes up about half their concert set says something about the strength of this album. 1. ok computer- radiohead    how do i love thee...let me count the ways...about 9, as in 9 of the best songs ever (actually track 7 doesnt really count, but its funny anyway).  3-5 kind of suck, but it seems that every compilation cd i make has at least 3 songs from this album.  the guitar solo in paranoid android is one of the best of the post-hendrix era imo, and electioneering is still my favorite songs even though it is about 7 years old.  karma police, airbag, and climb up the walls (the song that made me get...actually burn...this cd in the 1st place).  kid a and their newest one arent as good as this, but radiohead is still a remarkable band.  there you have it...edition 1 of my top 5.  if anyone has differing opinions (there should be no differing with this list) feel more than free to post a comment, i would love to hear from you (yes, you).
228 years...thats getting up there i say.  i wonder how many more years we have in us, i mean every great nation eventually collapses.  i would think that this wont come anytime soon, but in 150 or 200 years, will we still be as dominant as we are today?  i think outsourcing is going to hurt us a lot more than most people realize.  i hope that the tax incentives (if there are any) for keeping business in the country will be increased, bc this could really get out of hand.  i think labor in india is something like 5 or 10 times cheaper than in america.  why would any businessman keep his factory in america in those circumstances?  i think the government needs to do something about this.  anyway, there is my cheery, hopeful birthday wish to america.  honestly, i love this country and there is no way i would want to live anywhere else.  darn it, i am proud to be an american! i caught the last halfish of legend of bagger vance on abc last night.  i had heard it wasnt good so i never saw it, but i actually liked it.  one quote that really hit home was 'golf is a game that cannot be won, only played'.  i think thats why i like golf so much, and also why i am sick of competitive golf (about 3 more months!)  i think that, at least for me, the competition brought into golf by tournaments and high school matches kind of defeats the purpose of golf by making the competition with other people instead of yourself.  i am surprised at how excited i am for next summers golfing just bc i know i will be able to golf without any pressure and i will be able to just have fun.  the reasons i am not leaving the team in the first place are 1) my teammates are awesome 2) we have a great shot to win states, and 3) i guess i would feel like i was quitting on myself and everyone else as well.  so i will drag myself to tryouts in about a month and see where things go from there...speaking of competitive golf, i have another tournament tomorrow...at cumberland gc.  i have no idea where that is, so i am going to go mapquest it.  enjoy grilling/fireworks/whatever tonight!
yes, i am pretty sure those are actually fireworks outside thomas, but it sounds like gunfire (or maybe thunder).  red white and boom was pretty cool.  i went with cody chad and brad.  we ran into robby and his 'ladies'.  we also met some girls who kept asking us for cigarettes.  i guess it turned out that brad knew one of them so we hung out with them for awhile.  interesting people...we also watched a parade, where i found out that they only give candy to little kids.  even the political candidates in the parade do this, which doesnt make sense since the little kids cant vote.  i still got a 'stress relief ball' from dominion homes (the best of everything), so i am happy :)  the actual fireworks were pretty good, and we beat most of the traffic out.  then we went to codys house where we stayed up playing halo and watching tape delayed wimbledon matches until about 5.  quite happy to see sharapova win (no, not bc she is incredibly hot...i just dont really like serena).  on a side note brad was telling me about his girlfriend from quebec that he is going to hang out with in florida next week.  i told him to tell her 'tais toi', which is french for shut up, but i told him it meant i love you.  dont tell him (he will forget anyway).  i will be so proud of myself if it works :)  messing with people can be fun (to an extent). i am going against one of my principles right now and listening to a britney spears song on repeat (everytime).  i am definitely not a fan, but this song is really incredible.  it has a slight resemblance to evanessence at times.  i think they are one of the groups that will change the face of popular music (groups like genesis, creed, boy bands, duran duran as far as the last 20 yrs).  they created a unique sound; whenever i hear a new song of theirs on the radio i can always tell who it is.  more and more bands seem to be imitating them.  personally, i like this movement, there is more of a rock sound with more edge to it, while it doesnt diminish the vocals at all.  theres my musical analysis for the month (more like my whole life). ps those 'fireworks' on the last post looked a lot better in the create post box than they do on the actual site.  sorry :)
hmm...blogger is not being particularly prompt in the area of posting stuff.  i posted like 3 hrs ago and it hasnt come up yet on the site.  unlike last time i will wait and not repost which could make me feel stupid...just got back from shopping for camp stuff.  nothing terribly exciting happened, except i saw a guy with about 4 teeth total.  it was kind of disgusting, but i felt really bad from him.  i had thought columbus was kind of through with the hick image, but i guess were not done yet.  maybe he just chews tobacco a lot...very unhealthy habit might i add (plus those spit cups are completely repulsing).  just downloaded a new song called 'Jesus walks' by kanye west.  it has been on power 107.5 ('columbus' hottest hiphop and r&b'), now i have probably listened to it about 10 straight times.  i try not to do that bc it makes me get sick of it, but its really good, it confronts some issues that i have kind of wondered about for a while.   urlLink heres a link to his website.  anyway, im heading downtown probably in an hour or 2.  have a great holiday weekend :)  here are some early fireworks for you:     \|/         \|/     * |/  -*-    *    -*-   * *-  /|\         /|\    * God bless america!  happy 4th
apparently my 1st post did work, it just didnt come up when i checked it.  now you know i wasnt making it up though.  you also know that i tried to make them similar ('cup o tea').  oh well. golfed the same 9 holes twice this morning, shot 43-41.  i started off w/ 2 double bogeys bc some old guy was right behind me so i rushed.  i pride myself on being a fast golfer, so i picked it up, and i beat him to the turn by about 2 holes.  played the 1st nine in 58 minutes, which is top 5 for me.  the second time around i was even through 6 holes, then i finished bogey triple bogey.  i got stuck behind a twosome in a cart.  i waited for them on every tee from 13 to 17, but they wouldnt let me through.  of course, when i got to 18 they were like, 'want to play with us?'.  grr... another annoyance on golf courses is people who honk when they drive by.  its not like youre the first person to ever think about this, its not that funny.  somebody did that today when i was walking up to my ball.  what purpose does honking have then?  am i going to screw up my walking?  i guess i can see how it would be funny actually.  i still find it annoying tho. i am going to go shopping now :'( for camp.  wish me luck...
ack! cursed blogger erased my rather lengthy post.  now i have to write it all over, and it will never be as good as it was.  here we go anyway.  today was another day consumed by golf.  i played 18 holes this morning, where i shot 83 and played fairly well, and then i had a lesson this evening which also went well.  i also finished a book called 'mafia cop'.  its about some guy who grew up with his family in the mafia, but he became a cop.  for someone like me who is fascinated by organized crime, it was an interesting book.  it wasnt incredibly well-written or organized, but there was a lot of 'good stuff' as i like to call it in there.  its by bob drury and louie eppolito (can you guess which one was the mafia guy?) if you want to check it out.  next on my list, unfortunately, is a book for school called 'rebecca'.  it looks like some sort of romance novel, which is not really my cup o tea.  i guess i will just have to suck it up and read it...not sure why it was assigned. saw spiderman 2 last night with some people from school and youth group.  it was pretty good, it had more depth than what i expected.  a little corny, and some graphics (web swinging from building stuff) were kind of weak, but overall i would give it 3.5 out of 4 stars (yes movies are out of 4 stars, not 5 like a lot of my friends think...its not a restaurant or a hotel!  very annoying...yes i am easily annoyed, sorry.  it makes me more interesting as a person...maybe...) tomorrow i am going down to red white and boom ('largest fireworks display in the midwest') with cody.  i have actually never been before.  i know there will be a squidgetload of people down there.  i am predicting i will get mugged.  who knows.  i will carry minimal cash.  thats about all ive got for now. ps: the post title is the name of an article i read somewhere.  its by a harvard professor, so its obviously not conservatively biased.  its an interesting objective view.  im not taking sides on this,  urlLink but here is a link if you want to read it.   have a great friday :) and be safe this holiday weekend as an excessive amount of coppage is expected to be present (aka the po-po).  there you have it, i can use ebonics as well as the next guy.  there, now i am really done.
another day consumed by golf is under the belt...i got up early this morning and played 18 (shot 83, so i was happy enough), then i had a lesson this evening which went pretty well).  i also spent a few hours reading a book called 'mafia cop', about some guy who grows up with his family in the mafia, but he becomes a cop, yada yada yada.  for someone like me who is really fascinated by organized crime, it was an interesting book, but it wasnt especially well-written or anything.  i liked it though.  now i am going to have to read 'rebecca' for summer reading for school.  it looks like some romance novel which really isnt my cup o tea...not sure why my teacher picked this book.  i guess i will just have to suck it up and read it...or i could just use sparknotes.  actually i dont think the book is popular enough to be listed.  stupid book.  :( yesterday i went to see spiderman 2 with some people from my school and youth group.  it was pretty good, although some parts (esp the ending) were a bit corny, and the special effects when spidey was swinging around were kind of weak.  it had a surprising amount of depth to it though.  i will give it 3.5 out of 4 stars (so many people i know think movies are rated out of 5 stars! ack! its not a freaking restaurant or hotel, its a movie, out of 4 stars!  this is one of my fairly irrational pet peeves, bear with me). i am going to red white and boom ('the largest fireworks show in the midwest') with cody tomorrow, so i wont be able to work.  i guess there are about 1 million people there every year, which is about as many people as there are in columbus.  where do they come from? (west virginia)...no comment on that one.  anyway thats about all ive got for the time being. ps: post title is the name of an article i read.   urlLink here is a link to it .  its by a harvard guy, so its obviously not conservatively biased.  im not taking sides on this, its just an interesting and objective article.  so there.  have a wonderful friday.
sorry...i have a semi-interesting story to tell you.  wednesday i went golfing at medallion cc with chad (they bought a guest package for me...buy 2 rounds get 1 free...or something like that)  anyway, when we teed off, it was perfect weather, and i played ok.  i made about a 60-footer for double bogey on the 1st hole, and i ended up with a 42 with 2 birdies on the first 9 (rookery...tipped out baby!).  then we went on to preserve, where i was playing ok.  after 4 holes, chad pointed at the sky and said 'that sucks' (it was menacing, he wasnt just anti-sky or something...just to clarify). i said 'that wont hit us until the end of the 9.  so we played on.  on 5 tee, the lightning siren thing went off, but i was like 'just pretend you didnt hear it' (i am a negative influence).  so as we walk to the green, he gets out his umbrella, and i made fun of him for being a woman (obviously umbrellas arent for men), banter, etc.  then, a gust of wind blew it inside out, and i said 'see, God doesnt approve of transgenderedness' (it was funny, just go with me on this).  but wait, thats not all...he set the umbrella down to hit a chip, and it started to blow away.  then he started cracking up and fell on the ground, so i had to run it down.  it actually jumped over a fence and went onto a fairly busy road (sunbury rd for those columbus readers).  a couple of cars had to go on the opposite side of the road to avoid it before i could get to it.  needless to say, we went in after that.  unfortunately, we were literally as far away from the clubhouse as possible, so we enjoyed a 2ish mile walk in a torrential downpour.  this red crap kept squishing up through my shoe.  i still have no idea what it was, but chad thinks it was gum.  whatever it was, when i took my shoe off, my sock was covered in redness.  my mom thinks it was dye from the brown part of my shoe...who knows.  i honestly have never been that wet before other than when swimming.  i literally could not take my shirt off until it dried for about 20 minutes.  so there you have it.  if you didnt find this at least somewhat amusing, you might as well not read the rest of this blog as it is the quintessential example of my sense of humor (either that or i didnt tell the story very well).  that was more humor than you can shake a stick at.
notice a theme with these titles?  dont worry, i wont keep doing that.  anyway, i just found out one of the most annoying things you can do (other than not tipping your caddy...cough cough).  next time you buy something cheap with cash, like mcdonalds or something, give the cashier more money than you need to.  for instance, if you get 2 double cheeseburgers and a small coke (my usual order), the total is $2.97.  so i give them a $5 and two $1, which makes absolutely no sense.  they kind of stare at the money and then go 'you gave me too much', then you say 'can i have my change then?'.  it is one of the funniest things ever (if you have a somewhat malicious sense of humor as i do. (stressing the somewhat)).  i stumbled upon this by accident, but now whenever im in a bad mood or something, this helps me out.  no i am not a complete jerk, and if you feel like condemning me (all of you people who read this), let (s)he who is without sin cast the first stone...something like that.  i honestly dont think this would offend anyone though.  now that i have made this post unfunny with my political correctness that i cant stand in other people, i shall leave.
i have found the secret to shooting much lower scores in golf:  play the womens tees!  dont laugh...today i tipped it out on the front 9.  i hit the ball pretty well, but my wedges were going everywhere except where they were supposed to.  so i said, if i play the womens tees on the back 9, i will have a wedge into every green (at least par 4s).  so i sucked up my pride and did that.  i spent the majority of the time trying to think up tough comebacks for people who might make fun of me.  unfortunately nobody did.  actually that was probably fortunate as i couldnt think of anything other than explaining all of this, which would take way too long.  anyway, i was bogey-free on the back, and i shot a 1 under 35.  i hit a par 5 in 2 with a couple of 5-woods (3-putt par...ack!), and i had some sort of wedge into every other hole (except 11, a par 3 that i hit 9 iron on).  i figured that if people laughed at me they werent secure in their manliness, unlike me.  yeah...
since i have not been blogging for very long, you have not realized everything that has gone into my efforts to break 80 on 18 holes over the past 2+ years since i broke 90.  today all of those struggles finally came to fruition as i made about a 5 footer for a 78 on the last hole.  i had to go 27 holes to get it, and it was HOT out today.  i think 92ish, with more or less no wind.  so i am quite happy right now.  honestly, i think i will be satisfied with my golf 'career' from now on, as i hold no expectations of breaking 70 or anything.  i am kind of busy right now, so this is a short post, but i just had to get this out there and spread the good news!
yes, it has been awhile since i posted, as i was occupied with actually doing things with people and escorting ryan (my friend, who as he puts it, is from florida but happens to live in kentucky) around town...there might be something to this social stuff...i will attempt to make up for this with renewed vigor, or not.  i definitely wont use that phrase for awhile again. i dont think that he had changed that much, which was a huge worry i had.  i really felt sick when i was waiting for him to come.  i think he has changed somewhat, which is obviously natural, and i have also changed, even though i dont really perceive it.  so we got along pretty well, not as naturally as in elementary school or anything.  it was more like somebody from church i see 2 or 3 times a month, chemistry wise.  the thing that disappointed me was that pretty much none of his friends from 'back in the day' were available.  they were all on vacation, either that or they had some vague 'plans'...no comment.  so we ended up seeing a movie friday and saturday nights, and just hanging out.  we saw bourne supremacy friday with philip, dan, and andrew.  then ryan wanted to go to walmart for no real reason.  i dont know where any are (although i know there are some), so we settled for meijer.  he showed me how to do a 720 in a shopping cart.  i was kind of thinking 'you lived 5 minutes from the beach in florida, and this is what you did?'.  on saturday, we drove around for a couple of hours (literally) looking for his old house, which we eventually found.  then we played tennis and saw manchurian candidate with cody.  very confusing movie, but im almost positive i had seen it before, and no, it wasnt the original version...ha, it came to me...i saw a preview.  no im not completely stupid.  anyway...then we watched a street something or other, like a magician who didnt do much until the very end.  i didnt know they had those in ohio.  oh, but they do...then we hung around easton for awhile...i had no idea how ghetto it got.  i kept making stupid comments, like 'oh, theres ray allen' (i do that to people wearing jerseys...cant help it), and ryan said 'one of these days, youre going to get shot'.  it would be my honor to get shot for being dumb like that, and it might just cure me.  we went to church this morning, and after lunch at panera, he left.  i think goodbyes are so much harder when its not somebody youre going to see the next day or week.  maybe we can get together again when more people are in town...theres a lot more to tell, but this is probably kind of boring and long already. i did get a few new cds:  just be-tiesto; this is trance, vol 2-various; and ocean avenue-yellowcard.  all 3 are incredible.  the various one is like 80 minutes of continuous dance/trance mix.  i love it dearly, so much so that it will replace a rush of blood to the head (coldplay) as my new 'pre-golf' cd.  i may go over requirements for this later...ironically, one of the songs is a mix of clocks by coldplay.  i guess this genre is not for everybody, im not sure how thats possible not to like, but ryan could only take about 20 minutes of it, as it was 'driving him crazy'.  the brilliance would be lost on someone who listens to country music...ick.  anyway, i like other music too, so im not incredibly strange (at least as far as music is concerned).  but honestly, i dont see how one cant appreciate this music.  you can just immerse yourself in the driving beat and bask in the intermittent glow that is the synthesizer...(yes i am listening to that cd right now).  i picture somebody gliding through a pool and then coming up with eyes closed and smoothing their hair back in carribbean crystal blue water at dawn with a sun and sky gradually lightening during the moment of transition from night to dawn to morning to day.  but thats just me.  it makes great reading music too.  once you get into the book and the music at the same time, your reading speed is driven solely by the beats.  so when the drum and bass kicks in, i probably read double time and i still know exactly what i read.  its quite enjoyable.  of course, country people could ridicule me for not recognizing their whatnot for the masterpiece that they hold it to be...beauty is in the eye of the beholder...i hate it when i use cliches...i also hate it when i cant put accents over french words.  it defeats the purpose of using it. one other thing.  the espn/usa today coaches poll (college football) was released last week, and ohio state is #9.  i guess si said we were overrated, and candidly, i think we might be.  i mean, we lost 75% of the dline, and our punter (jts favorite play is in fact the punt), as well as qb, 3 recievers (not that the passing game was anything special).  also, aj trapasso, our only punting recruit seems to have the most legal problems this side of willie williams (ooh, how does that feel, canes fans?  oh wait there arent any real one.  ooh! im on fire!).  so i would put osu #14 or so.  bob hunter, a columbus sports columnist, wrote an article about the counterproductivity of preseason polls, and i agreed with it 100%.  so tonights top 5 will be my most overrated college football teams (no i will not put osu in there just for loyaltys sake...yes i can do that).  this post is already incredibly and annoyingly long, so i wont make it much longer.  feels good to be back!
Well ok, I used to play tennis at this clay court here in Singapore. It's probably the only around, so many expatriates go there for training. I met many people there, the most memorable one was this Indian boy that kept whining 'It's just a game' when I beat him 6-0. There was this boy too, by the name of Alistair, that I used to play with quite often, because his training slot was around my time too.  His mom was such a nice lady, and he was really such a nice guy. When I stopped going to the courts, I never saw him again. Only today, 3 months after his untimely death, did I know about it. Apparently he went in his sleep, with no medical records, no problems the day before. The baffled the doctors, and they could find no reason.  My dad always repeats the same old catch phrase when someone dies so suddenly: 'frailty of life'. Honestly if he can't find something fresh to say then he should shut his trap, sometimes people feel better without the overly used 'words of wisdom'. But really this death was a real bummer. How could someone so young be taken so early with no rhyme or reason. He's about my age so I inevitably started thinking 'what if it was me?'  I really don't know whether I should feel upset or glad at his death. On one hand, this guy just left his single mother standing on the edge of depression with his death. From my very short time with him I could tell there was a lot of love between the 2 of them. When something like that happens you naturally feel a little upset, but this time the feeling's different. It's this warm, fuzzy feeling in my heart that tells me not to be upset. Well actually I don't know how to describe the feeling so I just used an old and cliched catchphrase.  Those who know me would also not know that I've been thinking about death ever since I reached a certain level of maturity. All along I had feared death, feared the pain, feared the thought of going to somewhere really, really bad. Then my thoughts matured, and philosophy came into play. I knew what I wanted from this world; nothing. I've all along wanted to die an early death of old age. All along I've wanted to live a short, meaningful life; and die a painless death. I thought death by old age was the ony way death would be painless, but this death has opened up a whole new dimension for me.   I really don't know why the thought of changing places came to me. I know if I were the one to die my family would be devastated. But they have my sisters don't they? Then again I've always been the special one. The more intelligent one. The one that has the most hope in life. That poor lady had and now has no one else. I feel so sorry for her, but what can I do? If the lord were willing, if he called out my name, I think I would really not hesitate. I think I would gladly swop his place for mine.   By saying that I'm kind of implying that I have a really bad life. That's really not true. I have a really great one, but if my death could do something so miraculously good as to bring mother and son happiness, I would gladly do it. My only wish is that that could happen without me feeling pain. I'm a sucker for pain.
Ah well...  urlLink  I'm sorry  yesterday I was all wierd and emotional. I just wasn't thinking straight because it was my last day in a place I've been living in for the past 2 years. Anyway, for those who wants my take on my day yesterday, here it is...  Well my last day at school helped me discover a very Under the Radar player in class, Benjamin Siow. I honestly did not have him on my list of targets, and he just got 1+ marks less than me in average. Well what I can tell you is that he won't be able to go UTR anymore, of he's gonna get ready to get voted off. Essentially, I won't be the one getting him exposed, I'll let the Fairplays do the job; my dearest slaves Anjan and Jason will be all over this guy once they find him out!   I was also doing some bonding with the Fairplays, through a lame coin game. But it was really nice seeing another side of them, not having to be playing the game. I was in a really good mood until a 'Jenna Awardee' came into the game. Well, his name is Samuel, and his mouth shoots off like a donkey's ass once something remotely funny comes into conversation. Not to mention his mouth smells like a donkey's ass. Some very scientifically inclined people may like to compare his words to the speed of light, and his brain to the speed of sound.
The Finale... A title that lets your thoughts run wild! After the  urlLink  American Idol  finale I'm sure quite a few of you are expecting a commentary. Sorry to those people, because I've just been so touched by the song 'I Believe', and I'm gonna right about the finale of a phase in my life, and the beginning of another.  My dear friends would know that today was my last day at a place that I've detested and cursed for 2 years; the Boarding School. As I lay on my bed, the one that always seemed so uncomfortable at night but so appealing in the day, I heard the sound of something bead like falling on the floor. I looked in between the gape of the bed and the wall, and there was this glass star, the star that I had recieved on my first week here. I felt it extremely appropriate that I got the star back at the start of a new chapter in my life.  Enoch and Ken Wei helped to carry my stuff down, and him waving as my car went off reminded me of the ending of the movie 'Big Fish', where the characters of the persons life waved him his last goodbye, without any tears, but instead with joy. It is today, as I wave goodbye to the shining star of Miss Barrino, that I've grown the '10 inches more' that mother has always wanted...
Today at school was a huge mess up. Yes it was P.E. again, and I realised I could actually play Badminton... Well that wasn't really the highlight of the day, because I started to step up my little gameplan.   As I said in the earlier post, I need so badly to step up into Fairplay's shoes. Guess what people? I'm already on to it! I initiated a whole chain of jokes about Mr. Mad Devendran. I'm telling you, by the crowds that surrounded my table, I think I may be even better than I thought.  Today was also the 10th year anniversary for boarding school. Ironic really, that I announce my leaving on this day too. Anyway it seemed like a farewell party all for me. The starters were really great... Prawn salad or something like that. The clam chowder, though a far cry from my mum's standards, was far better than I expected. The rest was ok... until the horrid dessert.  Away from the food, the tiki torches outside really gave me a wierdly comforting feeling. I guess it's because there are now torches for the Survivor: OM in December. Something in the hall really didn't feel right, and it was because I was sitting next to a bunch of people that I used to be comfortable with, but I am not comfortable with anymore. I was sitting with none of my friends cause they were all serving... And I just didn't feel good. I really don't know whether it's because I'm leaving, or because I found that I had no real friends.
Being in my class, as I realized today, is like playing a huge game of Survivor. I find it appropriate, that as a SurvivorFire writer, I compare a few significant classmates to a few of our most loved, most hated Survivors. For your information, I got back my exam results today, and some more emerged as Fairplays, and even more dropped like flies. The first person Iâm doing is a guy named Ashok. He sits right next to me, laughing his ass off all day. Any Survivor idiot can tell heâs playing the game, distracting others by ridiculing the teachers. Before the exams, he was on my Fairplay list, one that really had the potential to do well, but was valiantly concealing it. When the results were returned, he dropped to a John (Marquesas) Award. He definitely outwitted the âsheepâ of the class, because a countless many fell into his laughing pit, but in the end he was completely outwitted by none other than meâ¦ There are 2 Fairplay award recipients, namely Jason and Anjan. Both play a very good game, and end up far, as in as far as top 5 in class. Both conceal their capabilities very well, playing the âIâm a doofus, donât worry about me role.â What I know is that they definitely go home to mug their heads off. Personally I fell into Anjanâs trap at the start of the year, I thought he was a lazy pig who would couch up and do nothing at home. However sad for him, the Nurse John from above entirely spoiled his game. I got a lot of feed about him right before the exams, and I marked him on my list as a competitor. Jason, because of my past experience with him, I knew his bloody game plan. Sitting next to Ashok and Anjan, I knew I had no choice, I had to step up my game or be eaten alive. I used to be a Kelly W, having no game plan but to win, win and win all the bloody immunities. I knew that once I lost my grip I would go, right then, right there. I slowly converted into a Nelehâ¦ I let myself be used as a pawn. I let the 2 believe that âHey, this guy is falling into my trapâ heâs no longer a threat! Even though my test marks were still maintained, they no longer looked thereâ¦ They only looked at how distracted I wasâ¦ All I can say is: Wrong Move! Stupid, Stupid People!!  I know Iâve still got a lot of work to doâ¦ For all I know, Iâm the one being outplayed! Now that theyâve seen through my bloody plan, maybe I just need a new alliance, maybe I need to be the new and biggest FAIRPLAY!  P.S. For those interested, I got 4 A1s and 4 A2s, that makes a total of Distinctions!
Ok, there's this friend in my OM team called Muthusamy. Since I have nothing to talk about today, I shall talk about him, and my Indian Physics teacher. As in Indian from India... I mean... You know what I mean...  Haha... Muthusamy is going to get the 'Diane(Survivor 3) Award.' Because that's exactly what he does, boss people around with his big fat mouth... Actually it isn't fat, but it's black. So anyway he is a guy that does all the slack jobs by opening his mouth to boss people around, and when people stand up to him, he cries. There was one particular time, when the rehearsals for OM were to be done in front of the Vice-Principal, and Diane here whined about having to go for a uniform group thingy. So naturally everyone protested and yadda, the case was brought to the teacher. In the midst of puberty tempers and very uncalled for tears, Diane revealed that what he wanted was rank and power in his uniform group. Oh my heck, how many people have an attendance like you... I mean I don't even go! We were lucky we protested and the case was brought to the teachers, because normally he would brush away protests like they were nothing, and just go on doing what he wants to do...  Actually it's pretty sad that I'm probably not going to do OM again, because I really loved the experience of staying in school till late, and all the bonding through ultimately fattening foods... Haha... Go OM!
I have something called an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder when it comes to turning off the lights. My mother always gets pissed at my living in darkness, and she always says something about darkness making her depressed. As if she needs anything at all to make herself depressed... But anyway my thinking today revealed to me why I always had these vampire like instincts, living in the dark and at one point biting others.  You see I've always wanted to die, like in my previous post. Just get myself away from this horrid and cruel world. But then, after I pass from this world, where will I go? In the Bible, we will supposedly go to heaven, a place of joy. We will be there for the rest of time. Just imagine yourself feeling nothing but happiness forever. Knowing that this will never end. Looking at it like that Heaven may not be too desirable after all. And I won't even need to talk about hell.  Now for the vampire part. You see vampires will never leave this world. They just live and live and continue living on in this world. The only difference from heaven is that these vampires live in a changing world. A world with emotion other than joy. A world that is free for you to explore. A world that you know, and if you don't, will grow to know. Vampires live in a world where they are free to do whatever they want, without facing consequences. Of course there's the downside of having to take lives.  By belief, vampires are servants of Satan. If only I could be a vampire not under the control of Satan, not under the control of God. If only I could be the master of my life, my free and everlasting life...
Ok... Singapore just broadcasted 'World Idol' and I'm wondering why Asians could not vote. Racist people! Anyway only the first 6 people were shown, with the last 5 due next week. So here is my commentary for this week's show.  Ok when the German guy came out I was like 'What were you thinking? With that sleeveless shirt?' He is quite a good-looking guy though, but his song choice is really bad. Up-tempo songs don't usually go well with the public's taste, and he will not have an audience large enough to win. For his limited English, I would actually say that was good enough, just not enough to win.  The Aussie Idol had a great voice, but his flamboyant style really puts me off. What's worse, he picked a well known song, changed the arrangement totally and destroyed the song. He was like talking melodiously, creepy. For the Pan Arabic Idol, who am I to judge? But anyway all I can say is that I thought her to be very brave but maybe her target audience is not huge enough to win World Idol. Right from one of the judge's mouths, funny he was reading my thoughts...  The Dutch Idol is another super geek turned superstar. And I really like his sense of humour, banking on his geekiness to give him the cool look. And this is emphasised greatly on the spectacles! He was quite good, but not outstanding, and like I said before not outstanding, means not winner. I'm still wondering however, how he got through the second auditions when he forgot his words. I don't think American Idol would have allowed him to.  A law student with a big face. Sy whatever you want but his voice is really good. His performance however really pitchy. I don't know if he uses English frequently, but anyway not good enough to win. But anyway I don't think anyone was paying attention to his pitch problems because of his good looks.   The Polish Idol... Ok, first things first, BRACES? Oh my god, Simon is never going to use the phrase 'Too young for the competition' anymore. Well obviously she had a lot of pitch problems and an awkward sense of volume control, but like the German judge said, she has a big voice, and an even bigger personality. I love the personality and the dialogue between her and a few of the judges. I especially like the one where one of the judges said something about her being as bad as the Polish judge, and she had a look of pure horror on her face as she answered 'No, not him!'   Hahaha... That's all for today, I'll bring you more next week!
Yep, I was playing 'The Sims: Superstar' yesterday, and I killed 2 people! Well I'm getting a little wierd, using the example of making a 70 year old couple give birth to 4 kids to tend to the farm! Well anyway I was getting jealous at the kids not having to go to school on alternate days, without having to see a doctor!  Well anyway I'm not staying in Boarding School for the next semester, and so my dad's going to get a timer fixed in my bloody computer. I hate that so much; what if I had a project that needed so much time to fix. I can see it now, that big red sign; 'You have exceeded the time limit. Please call your father if you would like to request for extra time!' Oh my gosh, why can't these people just trust me? But anyway, on the bright side, my computer can be re-booted now!  Sorry for having nothing to write, but there's a difficult challenge on Survivor Fire that my tribe is currently trailing in. So I've gotta help...
Yeah... It's the June holidays and I'm kind of taking a little time off from my beloved blog. But anyway if there's anyone reading, today will be all about the French Open final between two wonderful players; Coria and Gaudio!  Well with all the drama and theatrics, it was absolutely impossible for me to keep away from this topic. First was the loss of a set to love by a frozen Gaudio. I kept my hopes alive of Gaudio winning, but after it reached 5-1 in the second set I thought it would be all over. But a spark can be re-lit in the presence of oxygen, I thought, and remembered how he climbed up from a 5-1 in the second against Nalbandian. For a moment that seemed to be the case, as he went up 5-3, but then he lost the set.  My Dad was saying that Gaudio did not deserve to be there, did not even deserve the challenge. My dear daddy, I thought to myself, ' In an unfair world it matters not that you deserve to be there, but that you are there!' The crowd was all behind Gaudio, and he climbed back up a set 6-4. Coria had strained a muscle, and was experiencing cramps. Huge drama it was when he was reduced to a snail's pace and lost a set!  In the final set both men were exhausted and Coria seemed to have recovered from his cramp. But anyway with crucial breaks at almost every turn, tension was high, the crowd was restless and the cheering could only be stopped by hitting a serve. All the rest was bullcrap tennis and really is not worth mentioning. Gaudio won in the end, after all his nervous laughter and his funny antics.  With all the drama and the theatrics, I believe that if I were on court that day I would win. Because I, for one, can act!
Well looking at the amount of homework I've got for the June holidays, I really shouldn't be calling it the June holidays anymore. In fact, from now on I shall call it 'Home School.' Can you believe it? After the stupid SARS homework being posted on the internet, the school seems to have found more eco-friendly to have us print our own homework out. Like I said before, death iways a good option.  Anyway I really have nothing to write about. I'm basically posting for the sake of posting. So today, like I said a few posts before, I shall tell you about my friend Chun Ming. I've also said that I have no doubt my relationship with him is nothing but friendship, because I knew him before my hormones started raging.  First to his appearance. He has a really, really broad face, even broader than mine actually. He used to be really skinny and stalky, but now I've reached puberty and I've grown to be of equal height. And now he's sporting a bulging tummy that he doesn't want to bring up. Really, sometimes when you look at him he looks like a Chinese version of Barry Manilow and Clay Aiken crossed. Just that his face is growing just a little plumper. That too is something he doesn't want to bring up.  Now to his character. Obviously told by his growing body, he is a a rwally bubbly person, if you get my drift. His mouth can never stop complaining and talking. But unlike the 'Jenna Awardee' Samuel See, he spouts things that actually make sense. He is a creative thinker, like me and was involved in the OM competitions. He has a knick for shooting off his mouth sometimes, and the younger petty me got really angry with him once for letting off a secret of mine. But now he usually keeps his mouth in check. I have a wierd feeling that he'll make it well in the corporate world, but his stupid ambition is to be a teacher. His has however a whole list of ambitions; from owning a bus company to being the head of the Land Transport Authority. Any tourists to Singapore on a shoestring budget, go to him for help for public transport...
Here is my supposed-to-be-unopiniated summary of the 4th leg of the race. I want to start off on a particular note, the note that basically says that Colin is a dirty, lowdown, son of a bitch. There, the start to my opinionless summary.  Ok so the teams got the clue at the pit stop, telling them to take a 20-hour bus ride to Buenos Aires, where they'll get their flights to Russia. Woohoo! New destination! Anyway, the teams arrived at the bus station one by one, and everything was closed. They agreed that they would get their tickets in the order to arrive, but when Colin & Christie talked to a ver sad man, they found here was a bus that left 3 hours later but still arrived at the same time. The queue rearranged, because of that scum of the earth. Mirna pissed off a few people, and drew an absolutely ucalled for 'Don't talk to me' when she tried to ask Lance what was happening. The piece of shit went and bought tickets for 4 other teams, because 'that's the order in which they were there.' Hello colin... I didn't see any queue!??!         The four behind teams rushed to the airport, where Charla & Mirna standbyed on a Swiss Air flight. I really don't know if they knew about the flight to Germany at this point, cause they were playing push barbie around the airport and not bothering to find another flight. The twins & Bowling moms worked together while Bob & Joyce had no time to look. And everyone left... Oooh! Look who's the business loser this time. Bob & Joyce got business class seats! Haven't they learnt from 4 previous seasons? Anyway, everyone leaves and Charla & Mirna are left behind. They unexpectedly catch the Marshall & Lance flight. Like I said, I don't know if they knew already that there was this flight, but if they did, they're the airline experts for this season.  So, everyone arrives in Russia, and they find the stupid battleship. Fro the first time since the first leg, we see the Yield! The Detour: Block 5 shots, in which the teams travel to a nearby skating ring and have to block 5 ice hockey slap shots. And Drink 1 shot, in which the teams had to travel further away to do this traditional drinking thing. It's obvious to me that the drinking was much easier, and unfair also cause Charla's arms length would be too short. For some reason, there's no pictures with Charla looking absolutely hilarious in the ice skating outfit.         They had to find a bronze horseman in the middle of St. Petersburg, which is a waste of time route marker cause they didn't do anything there. They were then told that they had to go the the Old Tower for the most exciting Roadblock ever. Caviar, the most expensive salt there is on the market. The favourite topping for the high society table was wasted on one of the best thought Roadblocks I've ever seen. 1 friggin kilogram per person, which makes a total of 8 kilos. Now if 100 grams cost about 50 bucks, 1kg wouls cost 500, and 8 would cost the producers a whopping S$4000!         Anyway, the sodium chloride imbalance in most of the eaters mentally balanced Chip, who finished it in monster speed. The only other guy who ate, Marshall, could not match up, but was still miserably fast. Brandon and Colin are IDIOTS! The best eater was Charla, followed by Joyce. Nicole fell terribly sick, which shows she already has a little imbalance on the caviar side. Christie did not fall as sick, which means she's perfectly normal. Oh what a chemically incorrect task, but who cares anyway?  The teams all made thier way to Catherine's Palace, their pit stop. Yadda and Bob & Joyce were eliminated! Now, the producers are going to have to pay for the huge water bills that the caviar eaters were going to drink.
Amazing Race's Sports Injury by  Ethan Alter    The Amazing Race's father-daughter duo, Jim and Marsha, got off to the roughest start of any team. After Jim took a tumble on the Santa Monica boardwalk and ripped up his knee, they were forced to go to the hospital, and nearly missed the first airline flight of the race. But they never gave up, battling their way into third place on the second leg. Their luck gave out Tuesday night though, as plane problems grounded them for good.     Ethan: So Jim, how's the leg?     Jim:  Oh, it's fine now. The stitches actually popped out five minutes after we were on the airplane. At that point, I was just concerned about infection, so I was taking antibiotics. Eventually, it went away and now I've got a nice souvenir scar.   Marsha:  He doesn't have feeling in the top of his kneecap though. He never mentions that part. But that's my dad, I guess.    Ethan: I'm still impressed that they were able to sew your wound up so quickly.     Jim:  That's actually a funny story. The nurse was taking her time, and I knew I had to get her on my side. She said, 'I don't understand why you just can't take the next flight to Uruguay.' So I said, 'You don't understand, I have to get on that flight. I didn't want to tell you this, but I'm a producer and I'm filming a show in Uruguay. My camera crew is already on that plane. It's going to cost millions and millions of dollars if we have to delay the production.' And she goes, 'What kind of show are you making? Is it some sort of animal show?' I saw a spark in her eye and said, 'Yes, it's an animal show.' She said 'Oh, really?' and then ran and got another doctor and a paramedic and all three of them did the procedure together. And then she said, 'Okay, you go ahead and produce your show, but no running and no jumping.'   Marsha:  She gave him a narcotic for pain and Dad threw it away because he didn't want to have a fuzzy head. All that injury and no pain medicine, I was so proud of him. We felt so victorious walking to the flight â I could hear the Rocky music in my head!       Ethan: Settle another issue: Did those bowling moms lie to you?     Marsha:  We still don't know. We overheard them talking to some locals, but they weren't discretely talking to them. It was like they were trying to lure other teams into listening, and I totally fell for it. After we got to the exchange booth and no one else was there, we figured they had tricked us. But then we wound up beating them to the pit stop and we thought that maybe we were just so wrapped up in the race that we misunderstood. We never confronted them about it and they probably had no hand in it. I can't wait to talk to them and say, 'We're sorry for saying such nasty things about you!'    Ethan: What happened to you at the Buenos Aires airport? That was confusing.     Marsha:  I told the woman behind the counter to book us on the 9:10 flight, but there was only one seat left. So I had her book me on that flight and put Dad on the standby list. I also asked her to confirm us for the 10:30 flight. I think confusion arose because Brandon and Nicole â whom I never should have helped in the first place after they screwed us over on the first leg â asked us to buy their tickets, too. So now I'm asking for a lot of tickets, and I guess the lady got confused. In her mind, she said, 'Well, Marsha's got a ticket for the 9:10, so I'll put Jim and Brandon and Nicole on the 10:30.' So I think we're set and then Dad sees that I don't have a ticket for the 10:30 flight.   Jim:  She made the mistake of not giving us the tickets that we asked for and I made the mistake of not checking the tickets at the counter. Once we got back to the counter and realized she wasn't going to admit her mistake, we got the airport manager in on it and even she couldn't do anything. But we still didn't think we were sunk because we were first on the standby list for the 10:30 flight. So we get to the gate and they start calling out all the standby passengers, except us. We asked what was going on and the guy didn't even look at us. It was very apparent that we were not getting on that plane. He took Kami and Karli ahead of us, even though we were first on the list. I don't know how that happened. They may have done something behind the scenes that we didn't see.  Marsha: Or maybe he just thought blonds were cuter than brunets. [Laughs]    Ethan: You got on the 11:30 plane instead. Did you have any hope of catching up?     Marsha:  The episode didn't indicate this, but our plane was actually delayed for another 30 minutes. Once we landed, we ran a really quick race. If it wasn't for those 30 minutes, I think we could have caught up to Marshall and Lance. The producers even told us later that we were really close to beating those guys.
Ok... That title is entirely random and hysterical. But anyway, this is my comments on each individual team on the third leg of the race, with teams showing their flight arrangement skills for the first time. The first leg isn't counted cause the flight arrangements were printewd on their Route infos...  Colin & Christie -- A first place finish was entirely unearned. They were featured much more this time than in the previous episodes, and we all saw that there's really nothing much to them. They're only first because of their ability, if you can even consider it an ability, to outrun Charla. There will come a point in the race where the team will face some immense difficulty, and this team will crumble because of Chrisie's inability to keep calm and be nice. Colin is a great racer, with his ability to keep calm and his classy aggressiveness in getting his plane tickets. Christie, on the other hand, will do nothing except to bring the team down.  Charla & Mirna -- Charla & Mirna showed that they had mental powress that could overcome a lot of physical obstacles again. They are paying for it, with Charla having limited choices to make in the physical tasks. I love it that they're so aggressive but can still work well together, but they need to be nicer to the other teams. I know they're policy is to be nice to those who are nice to them, but they do not need to flare up at those who aren't. If they didn't flare up today I think they'll be in a good position to go very far, but at this point, a Yeild might be the price to pay for being mean. Boo Mirna! Charla is having a hell lot of fun in the race, except the part where she turned into a chocolate loving frankenstein after getting electrocuted. It's sad that they made an alliance with people they cannot trust... They really need to use their Yeild power now, with most effect on Marshall & Lance.  Brandon & Nicole -- Nicole first; it wasn't a smart move revealing your bond with Charla & Mirna at the airport. I fully agree with Mirna on this one. One good thing is that she has revealed herself to not be the whiny one in this race, cause Christie is the one that has gone miles ahead of her in this area. Brandon seems to be the only one in this team, taking the reins in trying to find flights, doing the tasks cause he's stronger, and according to him has a bigger stomach for chocolate. I have to give the team their props on getting to the 2nd flight, cause I really didn't see them working. Maybe it was just dumb luck. It was really despicable of this team to go leave Charla & Mirna in the lurch like that, with possibly no flight out.   Bob & Joyce -- I'm actually starting to like this team, of course under a certain influence. They've been consistent in their 4th - 5th place finishes even with their lack of physicality. They weren't featured much in this episode, but I think they can use their age more to their advantage while getting flights. Too mild to fight off the aggressive teams at the moment, but sneak under the covers and be really, really nice, and you'll get pecedence over the others when it comes to this area. Maybe the world of internet dating isn't so bad after all...  Kami & Karli -- They got really lucky with the flights this week, but it might just die on them next week. Their characters are so similar that it is impossible to tell between the 2. Didn't notice much of them this leg, except for the fact that they keep bumping into Chip & Kim everywhere. Really showed their stupidity by missing the strip of shallow water leading to the island. Coupled with them walking right past the cluebox last week, I will safely quote my friend saying, 'They use their legs more than their eyes.' Big Question: Will they be back battling for last place with Chip & Kim? Definitely yes, and they'll hopefully be joined by Marshall & Lance.  Linda & Karen -- Karen's definitely the better racer in this team. She's giving way to Linda the big chicken by letting her do the easier, more enjoyable tasks. Linda will definitely bring the team down at some point, and Karen won't be able to do anything to stop it. Unless Karen has the angel-like temperament of Zach last season, she will also not be able to take the heat and will collapse with exhaustion at having to give way to her much weaker teammate.  Chip & Kim -- Back in third to last place, and Chip declares that they're moving up, slowly but surely. Surely you realise the elimination cut off point is moving up faster than you are. Chip didn't really show any of his idiotic qualities this week, but I'm sure it'll come out next week. Hopefully we get to see whichever one, the twins or them, get to the Yeild and try and kill one another. Chip is such and idiot but doesn't use his meaness meaningfully, like in getting his tickets.  Marshall & Lance -- Marshall & Lance was the team that really deserved to go this week. I said already that I wouldn't mind, and wouldn't be surprised if these 2 went. I'm going to say that again this week... I give them their props for getting the second flight out, but that 'I'm dead' attitude at the roadblock probably would've made 10 white chocolates go down his throat without them noticing. The guy that wasn't doing to roadblock wasn't helping. Showing your frustration at you teammate is never a good idea. They are really boring, and ti sure looks like they get into trouble next week.  Jim & Marsha -- This pair definitely could've made it together. They're like the nice guy team this time aroung beside Bob & Joyce, and we would've loved to see them go further. As much as I don't want to, I have to bash them for their lack of skill in getting plane tickets. Really horrid that you managed to get tickets for someone else on the flight you weren't booked on. And in the whole race I've never, ever heard of only one team member being booked on a flight... Sad. They stayd positive till the end and there's a plus point for them.
This to me was the best episode yet! With the dating couples ending their losing streak, and a proper, fun Roadblock and an even choice for Detour. The only sad thing was that the photo album is short of any good pictures. Boo the editors! Give me the photos, and I'll pick out the good ones for you...  Ok, so the teams left the pit stop in Buenos Aires. Brandon & Nicole got stuck in the mud, and Charla & Mirna, thinking they were friends, stopped to get them help. Charla , in the process, got electrocuted by an innocent looking fence. Poor her! The first betrayal: Charla & Mirna go on a different path. Brandon & Nicole, a few feet behind them, don't even bother honking to warn them...  At the airport, Brandon & Nicole found that all the counters were closed, and they decided to try to call for information. The earliest flight, at 9.10am, was full. The next flight, they thought, was at 10.30am. Everyone queued at the Argetina Airlines counter, but Marshall & Lance decided to go out and investigate. This I have to give them props for. Unless you have no time left, do not be satisfied with what you have. Charla & Mirna followed suit, and hearing that there was a 9.40 flight, ran to a ticketing counter just across the hall, lining before Marshall & Lance. Jim & Marsha helped Brandon & Nicole get tickets, which again violated Nicole's promise to help Charla & Mirna get tickets. In the end, Charla & Mirna, and a very lucky Colin & Christie, without Christie's help, got on to the 9.10 flight.         With that, the teams made their way to Bariloche, Argentina one by one, in 4 seperate flights. They were supposed to find the mayor of the place, but surprise, surprise, there's no picutre of him in the photo gallery. Anyway, from there, the clue directed them to a chocolate factory. Their task there was to chomp through 11000 chocolates to find 1 of 20 with a white centre. To me, and a few teams, this sounded like an easy, almost pleasurable task. However, people almost puked at the amount of chocolate they had to wolf down. I think it wouldn't have been a problem for Mr. Sweet tooth here, but I really haven't eaten that much at one go... So who knows? Charla proved that she was a little monster by zipping past Colin to receive a clue from her dwarf friend. How cute, or rather, coincidental.         Ok, so they head to a mountain thingy where they had to choose between 'Rough Riding' or 'Smooth Sailing'. Nobody chose rough riding but it was a ride down a rough hill that is nothing scary, but slow. To me, the fear of falling down on a rough slope and feeling pain is much more than the fear of heights. Smooth sailing required the teams to go parasailing! Well, all the teams had fun!         After the parasailing was the pit stop. A little island connected to the main piece of land by a strip of shallow water... You know that kind of dreamy thing... Kami & Karli went temporarily blind and swam across insted of walking. But other than that, nothing happened. Aand Jim & Marsha were eliminated, if you were wondering...
Amazing Race Exes Get Evil by  Ethan Alter  &nbsp; Alison and Donny It's often said that time heals all wounds. Apparently, that maxim doesn't hold true for Alison and Donny, the bickering couple who went from first to last during the second leg of The Amazing Race. In this exclusive Q&amp;A with TV Guide Online, the estranged pair of losers air their grievances and let loose with a few well-aimed barbs. This unpleasant exchange is about as real as reality TV gets, Race fans. Buckle your seatbelts!  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Alison, why did you decide to do another reality show so soon after Big Brother 4?    Alison:  I got an e-mail from CBS asking if Donny and I wanted to do The Amazing Race together. I asked him, and he said he wanted to do it. Of course, I wasn't going to be the one to hold him back from winning $1 million and I was also all about trying to win $1 million. So we mutually decided to do it.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Aside from the obvious, how did the two experiences differ?    Alison:  Well, here you had to work with teams, and that sucked for me. It was a lot easier to do things on my own and do things the way I wanted to do them. During the race, you have to be impulsive and quick and if you make the wrong decision â or if you let someone else make the wrong decision â then you're done.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Donny, why did you agree to sign on?   Donny:  Pretty much just for the opportunity to travel around the world on someone else's dollar. That's something you can never pass up. Neither of us had ever seen Amazing Race before, so we didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. And most of the people on the show have been fans for life. I'm sure a couple of teams had diagrams in their basement of everything that's happened on every single episode. We were almost going in there blindfolded.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   How did you prepare for the race?    Donny:  We were on the computer until four in the morning some nights doing straight-up research. You could tell from the first episode that we knew what we were doing, because we were the only people who actually asked which flight got there first. We did everything we possibly could to be prepared. We just tried to be overcautious at a certain point, and it didn't help much.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Did you have a strategy going in?    Alison:  We wanted me to be the brains and for him to be the physical aspect of the race. And in last night's episode, we kind of switched that a little bit. Donny decided to be mental as well, and that's kind of where we messed up.   Donny:  The race was way easier to do than dealing with her.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Was it difficult to watch yourselves argue like that?    Donny:  Not at all. I knew exactly what to expect. There were no surprises.   Alison:  It was difficult for me. I didn't realize that all the name-calling would be coming from his end, and the things he said after the race. I didn't realize any of that would happen. That was a big shock for my friends and family, too. [He] was somebody I had trusted and confided in and for him to say such hurtful things killed me.   Donny:  Okay, well, don't let your tears get in the way, because you're no angel.   Alison:  Oh, I didn't cry, don't worry.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   I guess this brings up the relationship question. Where do things stand now between the two of you?    Donny:  There's no relationship whatsoever. There's no speaking terms or anything. It ended the day the race was over.   Alison:  No, that's not true. I moved in with him and his family for a couple of months after the race â I don't know why you're deciding to lie. Things were actually fine after the race for a while. Then, I found out that Donny was not only verbally rude to me, he was cheating on me as well. So I decided to leave him.  Donny:  That's a good one, but no.   Interviewer:  Are you still living in the same city?   Donny:  We're not anywhere near each other.   Alison:  I moved like five states away, actually. Surprised, Donny? [Silence]   Alison:  He doesn't know.   Donny:  He doesn't care.  &nbsp;  Interviewer: Getting back to the race for a moment, what happened with the bus to the cattle ranch? That seemed to be the point where you really fell behind.    Donny:  We had no clue that there would be stops along the way. We thought, first-class bus, first-class seats, it would be direct the entire way. We also thought it was the only bus that went there. The other teams that got to the bus station after us found another bus that got there faster. At the point we got on the bus, we thought we were either first or last.   Alison:  I knew we were last.  &nbsp;  Interviewer: Knowing what you know now, what's one thing you would do differently if you ran the race over again?    Alison:  I definitely would not go on the show with Donny. It was sad because last night, all my ex-boyfriends were calling me, asking, 'Why were you ever dating him?' and 'Why did you go on the show with him instead of me?' That's the one thing I'd definitely change. I wouldn't have let him think. I wouldn't let him use his brains, if that's what you wanna call them.   Donny:  Well, your good looks got us nowhere, so don't worry about it.   Alison:  Hey, neither did yours.   Donny:  I would take the midget instead of her.  (Whoever the hell thought Alison was a bitch, look here!)  &nbsp;  Interviewer: Um, so... All in all, are you glad you did this?    Alison:  Yeah, I'm definitely glad.   Donny:  I'm glad I got to travel around the world with someone I hated.   Alison:  Maturity shines through...
I'm still wondering why I have so much to blog about this week... So happening! Well, anyway, I will never let anyone copy outside of my presence again. Yes... If you haven't already inferred, someone got caught copying my work. &nbsp; The worst thing about it all was that the person that caught the copycat was the Maths Dean. Anyone in 3.16 would know that the maths dean can be one hell of a bitch. Oh yes... Did I mention that she was a close friend of my mother's? Well I was relieved when my maths teacher told me I was 'almost' called up, which meant that I wasn't called up. But what happened was even worst. The Maths Dean made a personal call to my mom, telling her to 'keep a closer eye on him.' Oh... And you know what she told my mom? 'He was involved in a copying case.' Wow! That's specific enough... My mom actually thought I copied in my maths test, cause I was struggling with a question the day before. And I'll bet she'll get suspiscious should my results come out perfect. &nbsp; What a bitch... I really should get my maths teacher to clear this matter up. Call my mom then... Tell her that I'm getting my work copied instead of me copying... Now that will solve everything, cause she won't really care if I get As for everything while the rest of my class fails... HEHE!
I just peeked into my sister's blog, actually delved into it. I really don't think she expected me to do so... I mean, why would I be interested? Well, I realised that evrything she tells us is what she tells her friends on her blog... So much for family... It really doesn't say much of the complexity of her mind, does it? She is as easy to read as a book... And me being a Literature student, I can read between the lines. &nbsp; Well, there's a comment on her blog about me having nothing to say. That's just because I've been alone all these years. You always with my other sister, and Mum always with Dad. I've never had a permanent companion. I kind of think mom sensed it... That's why till now I have a maid to 'take care of me.' It's kind of like Survivor isn't it? With two prominent alliances and me as the swing. &nbsp; I really can't believe my older sister thinks that I'm having problems at school. It's so stupid...&nbsp;Do my results show any problems? Somethimes people like to be left alone, so shut your overly huge trap and pinch your gigantic nose cause I am not having any problems at school! I really hate it that she keeps telling me about prayer and how it changes things. It seems so super artificial and hypocritical, especially with your kind of situation and most of all your detestable character. &nbsp; I cannot get why my sis is so transparent, when I'm so complex in character. Haha... I'm too complex for anyone to read me, not even my parents. Thinking about it I realise how I never miss her when she's gone... How I never miss anyone but my dad. Could it be that I'm the Kingshaw of this story? Ohh... That's sad... Maybe it's because the girls in the family have never been too highly intellectual, and I'm only able to mix with those people, and in the case of my family, only with my dad...
Yes, the 'programme' I was referring to is the CIP I had on Thursday at Macritchie Reserve. We had to walk 1 hour in and out of the area we were supposed to go to and it was all counted for our CIP hours. How nice is that? I calculated a total work time of 1.5 hours, and it is clocked at 6 hours. Not that I'm complaining, but wouldn't it be better if we walked into an office to do 6 hours of proper community work? Then again, the Physical Education &amp; Aesthetics department has never been known for their efficiency... It was really more fun than work, especially with the antics of the dynamic trio we know as our class teachers! &nbsp; Mrs Toh was dressed much more formally than she would in class, but maybe it's because she wears clothes that look like a house elf's rag to class. With her age catching up on her, you wouldn't be expecting her to bend down to pick up weeds would you? Very surprisingly, she was actually sppeding up the hill to go weeding. Maybe the biologically enhanced foods have something to do with it. When she actually started weeding, it looked like she was tending to her garden. Staying in one spot, it was as if she was looking after her plot of flowers. When we were done, she beamed at us and told us the huge pile in the middle of the path was her's. Halfway done the hill, she actually started running, as in really running. ' To the aircon!' she yelled as our incredulous faces looked up at her. &nbsp; Mr Sham kind of thought he was Tarazan... He was looking for all the vines hanging on trees and tried to swing on them. He really showed a wild side of himself when he joined in the tug-of-war with the tree. Actually, I thought he lowered himself to my class' level of intelligence, which is not at all very high. But I tell you something... He actually has a car! I mean, it was pretty shocking to see a Malay teacher have a car, but his car wasn't even the typical Malay second hand car, it was a nice, middle-class car. Well... Call me racist, but Malays are never known to be rich are they? &nbsp; Deven was the most embarassing thing ever. He was trying overly hard to be funny, incorporating his little bit of Physics into a weed pulling activity. He was being blatantly ridiculed by Ashok and Anjan, but I have a feeling he really didn't know it. When I told him in his accent to 'apply the force' on the weed, he threatened to 'apply the force on your face!' I guess I don;t look Indian enough... Or maybe my imitation was too good. After we went back to home ground to retrieve our bags, Ashok caught a caterpillar meant to scare Mr Sham. Mr Sham managed to a certain extent hide his fear, but when Deven saw it he was totally mortified. He was saved by the ranger asking Ashok to put it back, and later gave the lame excuse of it having the possibility of being poisonous.
Yeah... I was forced to buy tickets for the Festival of Arts. If I had to spend my time and money on something, it would definitely be Drama. Even though I knew that the storyline had no backbone, it was still better than going into a sleeping room with the music teams. So yes... My very professional comments on the performance:  &nbsp;  Storyline -- The storyline is a failure. Anybody and everybody could see that. But this was meant mostly for inter-school fun, so the storyline doesn't exactly matter. The author of the script is definitely not a thinker.  &nbsp;  Script(dialogue) -- Amidst a sea of puns and witty comments, the script wasn't exactly too smooth flowing. It was really good enough for a school performance like that, just that it wasn't perfect. The witty asides are what's best in the script, and this is where most of the Drama Club sriptwriting skills shine. For the simple and nonsensical storyline, the script was almost too good.  &nbsp;  Characters -- The characters in the script are absolutely perfect. Each one represents the typical, overboard NS men often talked about. The Nerd, the Macho, the 'on' one, the totally queer one, the 'good future' one, and the 'cannot live without home' one. Sadly, the very interesting subject of Malay logic was not touched on.&nbsp; Malays are one of the main components of army life, without whom the&nbsp;NS experience is not complete. With a repetition of the 'nerd' and the 'good future', I really don't see why they couldn't do a dim-witted Malay. Super extreme cliches work well with the nonsensical storyline,&nbsp;but incomplete experience just makes the cast a little less than perfect. &nbsp;  Entertainment value -- Why do people watch comedies? To let loose, and have fun. With the flimsy storyline, the entertainment value had better be up there above perfection. Yes... Very much laughable, but definitely not high-level humour. After a while, the humour became very much corny and overused. I still do like the parts where the actors break into absolutely ridiculous and out of point dances. Their ability to incorporate a little musical influence really impressed me. It was the most highly intellectual humour in the whole script. &nbsp; Overall rating: Good, but not rememberable. 3/5!&nbsp;
Ok... Here's the comments on the teams that I bring every reality show I watch. That is if we here at Singapore aren't too behind... I titled the post perky underdogs cause the underdogs seem to really be having fun on the race! Go the underdogs! Here's the whatever I promised stuff...  Brandon & Nicole -- I said last week that much was expected of this team, but they underperformed last leg. This leg, however, was a totally different story. They showed no negative signs, no whining, and no complaining. Nicole, however, may be a little too inactive for my liking. Poor her getting shagged in a foreign country, and all her boyfriend did was look for his balls(pun!). Bad Boy... They got a little lucky with the cemeterys, having their taxi driver correct them...  Charla & Mirna -- GOGOGOGO the little one! I love you Charla! She absolutely rocked the episode with her punk dancing, her ballerina twirling and her 'stick your hand up the cow's behind' comment. It wasn't exactly fair that they got on the common ferry, but who cares right? It does make up for her inability to run, and she paid for it again at the foot race to the pit-stop. All I'm afraid of is that Mirna will feel like she's doing everything for the team, which is so untrue. I think Charla helped more with the slab of beef in the first leg. Nicole & Brandon are getting along well with them, so maybe, hopefully, the mentioned alliance next week is them. Then Brandon can carry Charla during a foot race! Ahh... I sense the first working Amazing Race alliance even before I see it! And did you see Mirna's face when she hugged Phil? Hilarious!  Jim & Marsha -- Wowzer! This team shocked me with their 3rd place finish. Who would expect the weakest team last leg to come out so strong this leg. Victims of the bowling moms? LOSERS! Ok... it was really bad of the moms to play so dirty, but who would believe that a middle class country like Argentina doesn't accept US currency? Even we in Singapore accept US currency! I really like it, however, that they finished in front of those moms. Rub it in their faces people!  Linda & Karen -- Who would expect the moms to be such home-bred bitches? Firstly, they've not heard of a foam party... Superbly stupid... And then they, like those bloody cowards in class, bully those weaker than them. How low can you go? I really, honestly, hope that these 2 go down next week. Who knows? we may get to see Charla jumping on her trampoline tummy... Btw, I thought the 'You outsmarted a cow' comment was serious on their part. And I still don't know which is Linda and which is Karen...  Marshall & Lance -- Who? What? Where? After a fluke showing on the first leg of the race, this team proved that they teams cannot be judged on just 1 leg of the race. They are so insignificant because they are humourless and entirely serious. Who was it claiming to be the Ken & Gerard of the race again? This team needs to go soon... They are of no interest to us viewers.  Bob & Joyce -- Really, really horrible leg for these 2, and they still managed to stay in. First, the wrong cemetery... A little luck was involved of course, but they could have simply told the driver Evita Peron and he would've known where to go. No... I have to speak in their native style... Chacarita! Chacarita your way home soon people! Oops... Sorry if I just cursed you... Anyway, really bad call with the detour. Just because you like dogs doesn't mean the dogs are easier. Matching the face is much easier than walking one mile!  Colin & Christie -- Same comments as last week. This team definitely has chemistry together, and a lot is expected of them. However, they have failed to show us any of their outstanding abilities. I really wouldn't be surprised seeing these 2 eliminated the next time. I wouldn't be too upset either! They're getting monotonous and are sinking into the depths of Marshall & Lance's oblivion. If they don't show well the next time, I will have absolutely nothing left to say...  Chip & Kim -- Chip's a bastard. Need I say more? Yes I do! They sank as low as the bowling moms this time, playing it absolutely dirty. I have to say though, the stand off in the cab was a very smart tactical move, and it was absolute fairplay, even though some might not admit it. I'm sure that everyone rather him be nicer and let the bloody taxi go. Well these 2 have got to take a taxi and go home soon, cause I have a feeling next episode Chip will show more of his torrid qualities that I will surely hate.  Kami & Karli -- Poor little babes got stood up by that bloody Chip. Really respectable that they managed to finish the dog walking task even though they hated dogs. Maybe it's because they're so catty... There seems to be a significant twist in the detours this season; one is much easier than the other. They're enemity with Chip & Kim will push them to use the 'Yield' next episode... I hope! These 2 teams will continue to battle for the last team in, I can feel it.  Alison & Donny -- What a bummer. Donny's a strong guy, but maybe he's too dimwitted. Alison's a weak girl, but she's smart. These 2 make a really dynamic duo, but queerly they were booted so early. Alison confirmed she's a bitch by walking away so defiantly from her partner after getting eliminated.
Ok... Here's my blow by blow summary of what happened on the second leg of the race. This week's picture album totally sucked, with no pictures of the tango detour. Very queerly, 50% of the pictures were of the foam party at te 'Shake' place,when on TV they only spent 5 mins there. The poster of the photographs was also crazy, cause Kami & Karli have so many pics when Bob & Joyce have none...  Ok, so you know they were in Uruguay when they stopped. They received the clue to go to the pub 'Shake' in the Uraguaian downtown. The little lady went the wrong way, which I was absolutely pissed at cause Brandon & Nicole were right there for them to follow. The bowling moms surprised me with their navigation skills as they took over Alison & Donny to reach the pub first. Meanwhile, Charla & Mirna chanced upon a hooker!  Amazing Quote at this point(says Mirna to Charla about the hooker): She's pissed now cause we're talking to her when she's got business to do.         And so the teams reached the pub one by one. Brandon & Nicole were the ones victimised by the task, with Nicole getting squeezed in the context of trying to burst her beach ball. Ok... That sounds sick! Ok, yeah! She gets touched and shagged, and for a moment I thought the guy was going to rape her under the foam while Brandon minded his business with the balls. That sounds sick again! Ok... The creepy face in the picture is probably the molester...         From the part house they were supposed to go to the port to take a ferry to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Charla & Mirna missed the ferry. I mean if Charla was normal they'd have missed it. Again... MANIPULATION! The little lady actually used her disability to her advantage again. I have a feelin this is going to be the trend for as long as they are here. She is one power pack... Getting the ferry to wait for the 'Guest of Honour'. Go the little one!  They got to Argentina and had to go to Evita's resting place. It was a cemetery called Recoleta, but a few teams got the wrong cemetery, going to Chacarita, where Evita's Husband, the president, was buried. It is absolutely disrespectful of the producers to make the teams run into the cemetery like that. Oh, and Charla & Mirna caught a buggy which decided it would help a 'little lady'.  Amazing Quote at this point(says Mirna to buggy driver): Little lady here! Little lady here!  And the teams received a clue for the Detour. Yay! In tango, teams had to travel 1.5 miles on any preferred mode of transport to El Tango, where they would receive a picture of one of the dancers. Then, they would have to enter in a horribly lit, beautiful and atmospheric theatre, where a large number of people were doint the tango. Recognise the face. Very difficult in the dim light, but still easier than walking 8 unruly hounds 1 mile. That was of course in Perro! Teams had to deal with hyper active dogs that sometimes were overly horny for their own good. Only Kami & Karli and Bob & Joyce completed this task.  Amazing Quote at this point(says Alison to the dog): You can't keep having sex!         From there, the teams went to a cow farm. What's it with cows this time? First, slaughtered, bloody cows. Then now its alive and fast cows... Oh the irony! Anyway the roadblock clue read: 'The person that's doing this task must have fast hands and fast feet'.   Amazing Quote at this point(says Charla to Mirna): You may have to stick your hand up the cow's ass.  And anyway, the teams did not have to do that. all they had to do was get a bananda off the cow's neck. Luckily Charla didn't step up to stick her hand up the cow's ass cause she would have been trampled to death.         All the blah and teams had to go on a horse carraige to their next pit stop.        Oh yes... Did I mention that Alison and Donny were eliminated? What a shocker. I really don't know what to say after 2 most expected couples got eliminated first... *hums away*         Opinions and views on teams will be posted later tomorrow I kind of tired now... And there's school tomorrow. *Sighs*
Yes... I'm pissed again! That Jenna I was telling you about is rally becoming the most irritating and impetuous bastard I have ever seen. Samuel See Boyao, a mention of that very name and I feel like puking my existence out of myself. He is a friggin deperate asshole who laughs like a bloody Hyena. He is such a desperate wuss that he needed a loser last year to introduce him to a loser girl. One look at his screwed up face and you'll know why he's so bloody desperate. Stupid, low class and unhumouring idiocracy is what I will describe his life as...  Well, he's really not as bad as the bitch of the class I will term as the 'Deena Awardee'. Being a secretary of the class he seems to hold more power than anybody else in the class. For some reason he doesn't dare face the class, has absolutely no confidence and charisma, but in front of the teachers... Ooh, that's a totally different story! 'Oh Mr Deven, so and so didn't do duty yesterday...' 'Oh Mrs Toh, can you ask them to donate $2 to the class fund?' Wanna be responsible boy? Start doing your own Maths homework and handing it up on time first! Hypocrites are those I hate the most...  Oh yes... Have I added that he's a bloody faggot? He flirts with that German student in the class only because he has influence over teachers. Definitely a good person for his re-nomination bid next year. Well kid, if it is a re-election bid, say bye bye to your power, and guess who moves in to your place? Haha... ME! No one supports your 'It's against the school rules...' (in a whiny voice) stand. No one ever listens to the feeble and suddenly without a teacher unauthoratative 'No balls allowed...'Who is the one who is gaining respect from everyone; the social groups, the uncool people, the smart gang and even the ruggers? ME! You think you got itsy bitsy control over your puny German ally? I kind of think he would want me to be in your place FAGGOT!
Here are the actual highlights of this leg, not my opinion!  The first thing the teams did when thet arrived in Uruguay was to find this hand on a beach. Supposedly it is the 'Last thing you see of a drowning person.' I really like it. Who'd think that you have an art form besides thosed stupid sandcastles on a beach.         From the big hand the teams went into the tree area where they hunted for ferry tickets. They took a ferry to an islan and went to a meat farm to recieve their next clue. At the meat farm, they found out that they had to carry a huge slab of beef to a meat shop. It was a very uncreative challenge, and my favourite team, Charla & Mirna, lost their lead because of the sheer physicality of it. I feel that for a team to gain a lead using their wits, and then to lose it because of their disability, is super unfair. Boo the producers!         Then came the Detour: Chips or Zips. Chips involve the team going into a casino to play a game of roulette. The teams start off with 20 chips, of which they can only use 5 at a time. They must match the number of the landing to get their next clue. My call, 4 attempts of 5 chips each will take you less than 10 minutes. Just bloody well try your luck! For some reason, there are no pics of them playing chips. Zips involve teams having to cross buildings on a zipline, then descend almost 20 storeys into the pool on another. That will take them about 20-30 mins at my guess. Might as well chips first, then try the zips!         Here's the pit stop photo which they didn't have in their photo album, It's different from the other photos, cause it's in a different section of the site...        That's all with their limited photo album. But Dennis & Erika, my initial favourite team, got eliminated! Sucks...
Amazing Race? Definitely! I don't see why CBS hesitated so much about bringing this season back, cause from the first episode, I can totally tell this season's going to be absolutely awesome! My comments on the teams... Well sorry they're up so bloody late, my sis's been hogging the com!  Alison & Donny -- Everybody hates me, nobody likes me! I thought that Alison would come in with that mentality, but no, only her little Donny is upset with her, or so she thinks. Overall this is a strong team, even though I hate to admit it! I really don't see any place where Alison can lie and cheat in this game. Flirting, is a whole new story. Maybe, since flirting can only be done at the pit-stops off camera, she can slvage her deviled reputation.  Marshall & Lance -- Who the hell? How the hell? When they reached the pit-stop, I was like, 'How did they get there?' They played an extremely insignificant role in this episode. It's either they are simply a boring team, or CBS is trying to keep them low cause they win the race. If another alpha-male team wins this time, I'm not going to be too happy, especially if it's this boring pair that thinks they're the Jon & Al and Ken & Gerard of this season. They might as well say they're the Rob & Brennan and Chris & Alex, since they're the only alpha males!  Karen & Linda -- Surprise, surprise! The bowling moms can actually do something. Do you actually belive that bowling is a sport mommies? The answer to that question lies in your physical condition. They only got eliminated by a smart but to a certain extent unfair twist in the flights. I mean they probably didn't even know that the second flight arrived earlier. I really liked it that they worked together in carrying that slab of beef. They weren't even tired after they completed the task. That's about the only thing rememberable that they did in this leg...  Bob & Joyce -- Our quiet couple of this race. They are very mild and nice people. Their lack in physicality, I believe, will bring them down in this race. They migh fluke like Teri & Ian, but I really don't think so. Letting the man do everything, my dear Joyce, is not right. You sould've help carry his backpack while he carried the beef. They remind me of an old couple in my church. The man had a stroke...  Charla & Mirna -- What can I say? GO GO GO THE LITTLE ONE!!!!! She said that she was here to break all stereotypes about dwarves, but to me she just displayed the exact thing I expected! I mean, after Gimli's performance in Lord of the Rings, I kind of think everyone's stereotype of a dwarf is: stubborn, strong headed and determined. She really impressed me with her firepower, zipping around everywhere like she was a cat on a race. Well she is on a race... Mirna's having the hots for Phil, that's going to be real funny! Too bad that we don't get to see the 12-hour intervals.  Brandon & Nicole -- Shame on you 2. Admidst high expectations, these 2 surely did not perform. They got on the second flight, and the twist in the flights surely saved them. Everyone, including myself, thinks they look like a carbon copy of Flo & Zach. They have in fact, displayed traits of being Flo & Zach. Nicole started whining in this episode, and it looks like she may be on her way to a number one spot that Flo has taken. Brandon, has not displayed Zach's wits, and basically that will bring this team down. Both models are heading for disaster with their most probable brainlesness (think Derek & Drew), but I'm looking forward to seeing whether they can beat Millie & Chuck in their christian proclaimations. Prediction, 4-5 place (think Derek & Drew and Millie & Chuck).  Colin & Christie -- The predicted power couples are surely not performing here, with Brandon & Nicole already down, these 2 went even 'downer.' They had the flight twist to blame, unlike the previous pair. I mean, who would expect such a smart, but evil twist? I really love their charisma and chemistry together. I do think they'll go far in this race.  Chip & Kim -- I do not like this team. There you have it straight in the face! Call me racist, call me anything you want, I DO NOT like this team. Firstly, they do not have the charisma and chemistry that the other couples have. Secondly, they made an absolutely stupid mistake. How can there be a task without the information? Booyah! I absolutely did not think they would make it to the pit stop so quickly. But I really pitied them. Phil should've just imposed a time penalty and got them over with it.  Kami & Karli -- They say the word 'manipulating' in a creepy, blonde way! All I want to say is mostly the same as Chip & Kim. Move away girls, Charla and Mirna are the smart ones that are going to manipulate Charla's glaring disability. The question is, do these bimbos do better than the himbos of last season? Probably not!  Jim & Marsha -- I would love to see Jim interact with Marshall. Imagine this, 'Hi! I'm Marshall...' with Jim replying, 'Really, I was only a captain!' Haha, sorry I'm being so lame. I kind of think he named his daughter afer the word Marshall... How stupid! Tearing your leg in the first few seconds just means this team is entirely incapable. Being the first Father/Daughter team, they are a huge dissappointment.  Dennis & Erika -- This team had the chemistry, the character and the charisma. It was really sad to see that they didn't have enough aggressiveness to be in the race. It was a sad, sad first bootee. It never pays to be nice in every reality show. I really thought Jim & Marsha deserved the boot more than these 2 did, but adious anyway!
urlLink    ï¿½ Chip and Kim Mcallister, married parents from Coto De Caza, California. Chip, age 46, is the owner of a web technology company. Kim, age 44, is the owner of an information technology recruiting company. They have been married for over 25 years and have three children.
urlLink    Colin Guinn and Christie Woods, a couple from Corpus Christi, Texas that have been dating for over a year. Colin, age 24, owns a cell phone store. Christie, age 26, is the managing partner of the Longevity & Wellness Center and the 1996 Miss Teen USA.   This is my current favourite team after the only couple with chemistry got eliminated... They definitely have chemistry together and I hope will make it far in this race.
urlLink    Linda Ruiz and Karen Heins, best friends and bowling partners from Palmdale, California. Linda, age 45, is a mother and tennis teacher. Karen, age 41, is a mother and homemaker. Both have been married for over 20 years.
urlLink    Dennis Frentsos and Erika Shay, a 'once engaged' couple from New York. Dennis is a 27-year-old mortgage broker from West Nyack while Erika is a 25-year-old wedding planner from Piermont. According to CBS, Dennis broke off the engagement after Erika went tandem skydiving naked with her instructor. No word on whether any peanut butter or chocolate was involved.  This was actually my favourite team to win. Sadly, they are eliminted cause of Dennis' nice guy attitude. Erika is so bloody stupid to lose herself a guy like this!
urlLink    Charla Faddoul and Mirna Hindoyan, first cousins from Maryland. Charla, age 27 and living in Phoenix, is 'married to the man of her dreams' and is manager/co-owner of a chain of ten sportswear stores. Mirna, age 23, lives in Towson and is an attorney who graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law. The two were born only a month apart in Syria and emigrated to the United States when they were young children. Between the two of them, they speak a variety of languages, including Armenian, Turkish, French and Spanish, and have traveled extensively to foreign countries -- skills that should prove valuable during the competition.   This is my favourite team based on purely character. I think they have the brains to make it far, but their physical disadvantage will definitely bring them down. Luck, luck, luck! Go the little one! By the way... Doesn't she look pretty fast for her short legs? I mean, she was whizzing through everywhere! Again... Go the little one!
urlLink    Jim and Marsha McCoy, a father and daughter from Florida. Jim is a 53-year-old helicopter pilot who lives in Jacksonville.

urlLink    Alison Irwin and Donald Patrick, a dating couple from Pennsylvania. As Big Brother 4 viewers are well aware, the 23-year-old Alison managed to cheat, lie, flirt, and backstab her way to Big Brother 4's final two, where shewas trounced by the equally deviled Jun Song in the program's final houseguest voting. Throughout the show viewers endured Alison's incessant whining regarding whether her relationship with 21-year-old boyfriend Donny would still be intact after he'd seen her Big Brother behavior. Obviously the answer was yes.  Now we have to bear through another season watching Alison cheat, lie, flirt, and backstab -- only this time while she travels (at least partway) around the world. Thanks CBS.
Yes, yes... By the time you read this I expect you to know the Greeks won Euro 2004. It's legendary isn't it? The Greeks let in the Trojan horse and boom, the Trojans get themselves smashed. Well in a way this is a literary dream come true, I mean, the bloody underdogs played a great move and they deserved to win.  The legendary Trojans went on defence, closing the walls and even getting the attackers to come in and defend (think Ronaldo). The Greeks knew they had to pull something off to win it, they had to risk it... As in in the legendary story the horse was suspected, and if they went ahead and burnt up the horse Greek's hopes were all gone. But the Greeks went for the risk, and they pulled off the Trojan horse trick. This is bloody scary... I mean all the similarities...  Oh well, not really my usual length of posts... But it'll do for now! Go Greece, boo the overconfident, overhyped ad overrated Portugal.
Haha! Today was my group's Youth Day presentation, and I tell you... It sucked! Why? Because it was so incredibly boring, and it didn't induce any strong emotion from the audience. That, is what you call a horribly horrid performance!  And I tell you, their downfall was using the most amateur instrument of modern day poetry, rhyme! Lousy, lousy, lousy, and they all thought it was marvellous... It is such a straightforward recitation of our thoughts that even my mom conceded it was bloody boring. Why, why, why? Why didn't they just accept that laughter is always the best way to get through. Why did they not accept my script? Because they wanted it serious.   I tell you that if you're being judged by a panel that supposed to be open to all forms of presentation, that thing would have been so fine, but hello, in front of a larger audience, the one sure thing that will win all of them is their participation. What can induce them to participate? Clapping! What can make them clap? LAUGHTER! Next time something like this happens... Fuck it off, cause they're not going to listen to the truth anyway. This team is so fucked up. Make Michael god then...
Recently blogging has been all the trend, and on the papers it's been pretty publicised. Some blogs have been singled out as good and popular; some of which actually mean something, some of which don't. Today I was unfortunate enough to chance upon one that was a diary of a tormented and life of pure idiocrasy.  If you are bored and want to take a look into the blog, here's the address(http://xiaxue.blogspot.com). I don't know what so special about her blog, cause all I see is daily routine and well, Singapore propaganda. Oh yeah... There's it's own bit of vulgarity as well. At least here I'm refined enough to learn how to control my anger when there's nothing but a blank screen staring at me. How can any proper lady get so crude without any provoking factor? Maybe, in her definition, a 'Singapore Lady.'  Here it's entirely different isn't it? I hate Singapore, I bash Singapore, only because unlike her, I am a highly intelligent person who has prospects outside of Singapore. What's even worse is that she actually generalised people 'Coming from English-speaking girl and boy schools like ACS or MGS' as those who traditionally quit the country for better opportunities. I don't know what's her bloody problem, probably that she was never smart enough to get into these English speaking schools. She obviously can't see that people in these, by the way top schools, have enough foresight to recognise that honest and long-term success cannot be obtained by those who stay illogically loyal to their country.  From my point of view, even my dog makes more sense than her. I'm just hoping that this extreme will, like her blog, attract the masses, the intellectual masses...
Drat it... I've been having problems with blogspot these few days, that's why my Amazing Race stuff is up so late. I couldn't log in properly, so I emailed the admin to find out whta's wrong. I don't know whether they did help me fix the problem, but anyway it's fixed now so I'm fine with it. Anyway I realised I'm not posting much about my regular life anymore, so since I'm free and not sleepy, I'll do that right now!  First let's start off with the tests. Quite a few tests back over the recent weeks, and I topped all of them! With a Bio and E Maths perfect, I'm invincible at the moment. At least since this week, that is... I had a E Maths test on Monday on a topic I haven't done with my tutor, and I know that I did really horribly. Then yesterday came the big blow, my English test came back and I crapped. I actually failed an English test. At one point in time I remembered being regarded as an English expert. And I failed my test, 21/50. Entirely depressing! I guess it put me in place, so now I've got to work even harder... I'm really starting to wonder how long more I can keep this up. I have a feeling I'm going to break soon.  Anyway for Biology that idiotic b!tch Kelvin Chen got 24/25. He's really scary, cause now he's pumped to try and knock me off my top spot. I hoped he got really discouraged by my beating him when I didn't even study the night before. I'm wondering how I can convey that to him. 'You're stupid... I didn't even need to study to get this one, and you worked so hard for a less than perfect score.' Any suggestions on how that message can get to him?  I went out with Mum and Dad today, and if I remember correctly I ate Shanghainese. My memory is horrible these days, need to think before I can remember what I ate a few hours ago. On the way there there was this old Caucasian man pushing his wife out of Gleneagles hospital. His wife seemed to be real sick and only had her ward robes on, and her flesh was poring out of it. I didn't mean to say she's fat, I just wanted to show how weak and helpless she looked. Anyway they seemed to be rushing to Tanglin Mall. I really don't know what was happening, but I kind of think she was pretty much ready to go, and her husband was granting her her last wish or something. It's scary to think that you might be in this position a couple of years down the road. That's probably one of the reasons why I don't want to get married. C.S Lewis once said, 'To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken.' I never want to fall in love.
Yes, I told you that all the animal titles would be my comments on the teams. The sphinx can be counted as an animal right? Even though it has a human head. Argh.. Nevermind! Letâs get to it shall we?  Colin & Christie â With a display of great wit this leg, they have gained a 13 hour lead over the other teams. They, however, seem to lose it next leg as Charla & Mirna steal their cab. They really deserve for their cab to be stolen, after all that bickering this leg. Going to travel agencies seems to be what Colin does best, but always remember, when thereâs a flight thatâs going to go soon, and you cannot afford to waste time, itâs not always the best option. Colin has a really bad attitude, and instead of Christie bringing down the team, Colin will succumb easily under pressure. I thik they have what it takes to go far, most probably to the final 3 teams.  Charla & Mirna â I canât make any excuses for their neglecting to check with the trusty travel agencies. Like I said before, the safer option is the airport. Their not being able to find a taxi was stupid, even though they did save a bit of cash there. Finding the 50 min earlier flight out was one of the best tactical maneuvers Iâve seen on this season so far. I kind of think if Colin & Christie had gotten the same tickets as everybody, they wouldnât have performed as well as these 2, because they wouldâve succumbed to âpeer pressureâ and went with the others to eat, drink and be merry. Mirna better start doing something for the team, cause now it isnât exactly balanced. With 2 people o the team with an equal number of plus and minus points, balance is very important.  Brandon & Nicole â Funny how the expected Final 3 teams come in 1,2 and 3 this leg. Of all the spoiled final 3 teams, I think this one is the worst as they succumbed to âpeer pressureâ to fellowship with the other teams instead of trying to find better options. Getting Chip to help, was it a show of manipulative powers? I donât know. Not much shown on this leg about them reallyâ¦  Chip & Kim â Where was Kim? I donât even recall her speaking in a confessional this time around. Chip seems to be the brains and brawn of this team, and Kim is just there to fulfill the âteamâ requirement to get into the race. I kind of think that they need to start bickering a little bit to make more of an impact on the show. Chip surely went up in my ratings this week. Although helping people is not so much a good tactical maneuver, Iâve said it before that Iâd rather someone play Mr. Nice Guy than good player. He better not help anyone if they get any further, cause he may just âhelpâ himself out of the race.  Marshall & Lance â All I remember of them was that Marshallâs leg was hurt. I donât see how he got that injury, unless he was so dumb that he injured himself during the 12 hour break. Oh yeahâ¦ He is dumb! I really donât know why they didnât ask help from anyone for the Rock & Roll thing, since one of them was injured. They actually showed a little race skill by checking in with the Air France office. Unfortunately, it was closed. When a team is rumored to be eliminated next round, I donât think itâs exactly viable to support them.  Kami & Karli â They really donât seem to have any brains. You know that youâre more physical than the bowling moms, and when you donât know where to go you might as well wait for them and then beat them at the Roadblock. It was risky for them to go walking around like that, without a clue as to where to go. If they werenât helped out by Chip, I think they would be roaming the desert for 40 years.   Linda & Karen â Domestic airport mistake, again! These people never learn, do they? Iâm just wondering how theyâll cope next week, because this week was all that was shown of them was mistake after accident, and mistake after accident. Again, the blonde one didnât do anything, and whatâs worse, now she has an excuse to let the other one do all the work. I was hoping they didnât catch up to the 3.15pm flight to Cairo, because they really didnât deserve to. Getting their money stripped of them was entirely deserving, but what wouldâve been better is that they got eliminated.
Anyone see dead mummies this episode. I sure did, but of course since the producers were not licensed to kill they had to almost kill them by stripping them of all their cash in Egypt. I mean, when youâre not going to be going to the airport, and youâre in a poor country like this, how in the world are you going to get money other than being a night soil carrier?  So, the teams left the pit stop in Catherineâs Palace, and found that they had to take a train to St. Petersburgâs Hermitage museum. There they had to find Rembrandtâs âReturn of the Prodigal Sonâ, something that sounds vaguely familiar. I kind of think I chanced upon it while doing my OM research, because Rembrandt is one of the registered artists in the problem. So anyway Chip & Kim took an extraordinarily long time to find the painting, while Colin & Christie started a leg of bickering by suggesting that the Prodigal Son was Jesus. Iâm left wondering whether God neglected to give him any sense of general knowledge. In the meantime, Charla & Mirna, unlike all other teams who took cabs, âchoo-chooedâ their way to the train station on foot. A great display of Race skills was shown when she asked locals about the painting.         Once the teams found their painting, they found that they had to go to Cairo, Egypt, for this leg of the race. Chip & Kim stupidly rushed to the airport, while Colin & Christie, a pair that has proven to be apt at flight arrangements, walked to a travel agency. A travel agency is the place where they actually check all the airlines for the earliest flight. In airports, their access to flight information is limited, and most of the staff are too lazy to check thoroughly.  Kami & Karli were the only other team smart enough to go to a travel agency, but they were too late to catch Colin & Christieâs flight.  Colin & Christie came to the realization that they were on the earliest flight to Egypt, and the others had been duped by the Lufthansa lady. They had a stopover in Paris, for quite a number of hours, I presume, since they had time to find another flight. This flight, instead of 2.25pm, landed at 2.35 am, about 12 hours earlier than expected. They got to Egypt and the Tower of Cairo, but found it closed. The poor things had to sleep in the Egyptian streets. I mean, even the poor Egyptians donât sleep on the streets, and they had to?!  All the other teams stopped over at Frankfurt, except Linda & Karen. They were found to be with the lying Lufthansa lady, who informed them it was possible to catch up in Frankfurt. She turned out not to be lying for a second time around, cause they really caught up. Meanwhile, in Frankfurt, cousins Charla & Mirna proved that they were too small to be noticed when they isolated themselves from the other teams to find better tickets out. It turns out that there was a better flight, and our little pink panthers, complete with the tiptoeing scene, left for the flight that landed 50 minutes earlier than the other. That scene, coupled with Lance stirring in his piggy-wiggy slumber, was one of the most hilarious scenes in TAR history.  In Cairo, Colin & Christie went up to the tower to find one of 2 âFast Forwardsâ in the whole race. In a way it was a good option because there are only 2, and the likelihood of you using either would be pretty small. Might as well take a rest from 1 leg of the race. They had to carry this sarcophagus, one of those gold coffin thingys in the pyramids that you usually see in the movies, from somewhere to a temple. Colin was being a huge jerk by thinking he was so smart and not heeding Christieâs advice. In the end, Christie was right and they carried the thing to the temple. At the temple, Christie refused to shut her gap and wanted Colin to admit he was wrong. Bad move! I should know since my fatherâs a Colin (same name, same characterâ¦). When they reached the temple, Colin halted and started bickering. The priest started shaking his head in disapprovalâ¦ Hey! These clue holders arenât supposed to display emotion! Well anyway, I was hoping the priest tear up the clue in objection to their quarrelling in his temple, but he didnât and sent Colin & Christie along to their pit stop, The Sphinx.         Colin & Christie arrived at the pit stop at 11.27am, and I have to fast forward 3 hours to when Charla & Mirna arrive. They go to the Tower of Cairo, and found that they had to go to the Giza plateau and follow the yellow rocks to their next clue. They went there, had a little trouble, and then finally got themselves to the Roadblock. From what I see, this was the most time consuming thing in this leg. It might have taken even longer than the Detour!         The Roadblock: one team member had to enter Osirisâ shaft and grab a artifact bag. Citing claustrophobia, Mirna asked Charla to go down. Iâm left wondering what Mirna can do besides getting her team noticed at ticketing counters. Poor little Charla had to climb every single rung of the ladder because of her âlittlenessâ, and after a while, with the bag as big as she was, she had to take little rests on the ladders. Those producers sure arenât thinking too much about her still being in the raceâ¦         Anyway, Charla & Mirna were given a map as their next clue, coupled with the contents in the bag. Puzzling for a little while, they assembled the puzzle on the map and found the little hole that led them to their next location. They found the Detour as other teams started arriving at the Roadblock. Kami & Karli, however, were easily dumfounded by the puzzle. Not like they realize that the oval room in the white house doesnât have cornersâ¦         The Detour this time involved Rock & Roll, and Hump & Ride. In Rock & roll, nice play on words to the producers, teams had to use an ancient method of transporting wooden blocks. Ball bearings in the form of logs were given beneath the stones and teams had to roll it, apparently across the length of a football field. It is, according to Phil, âphysically demanding, but if you master the ancient art of rolling stones, it can be completed quickly.â         In Hump & Ride, which only Charla & Mirna arrived in time for, teams has to get on horses to guide camels with carpets on their bags to a carpet merchant. This task was entirely up to the moods of the horses, whether they went fast or not. I have a feeling with all those empathetic horse and camel rearers by Charlaâs side, even helping her to get on the horse, they managed this task pretty fast.         And all the teams went to the pit stop, where the moms got last place. It isnât a big surprise as thereâs a Fast Forward. The producers wouldnât want the Fast Forward to determine who gets eliminated, especially since theyâre trying to downplay and eliminate the Fast Forwards. Anyway next week the mummies have to beg. Will they be wrapped up and sent into the tomb? I donât think they would fit into one of those sarcophagus thingys!
Wow! Ok... So today I got caught in ths thing that was shockingly similar to the 'Don't talk to me!' from Lance last episode of the Amazing Race. As you all know, the one person I really can't stand in class is Kelvin Chen. With his whiny voice and incessant speaking when spoken, or even not spoken to, I have about this much tolerance left for him.  Well, I don't know if he's under the impression that we're actually on good terms, cause he actually dared ask me for help. During recess, I was casually walking to my seat when he cut right in front of me and went 'Have you seen Liwei?' Really like Lance, cause I don't think he was expecting the person he hated most to talk to him. I honestly thought that 'Don't talk to me!' was going to come out of my mouth, but instead, I just stood there for a moment and then shrugged. Ahah... That just proves that the 'Don't talk to me!' was uncalled for! Boo to Marshall & Lance, who are rumoured to go next week. Thank everything on and off the earth should that happen!  Anyway why he asked for Liwei was because the estate office found out about the key. What happened was that the smartest boy in the class, Liwei, was handed the key on Friday to open the door back from the lab. He did the stupidest thing by throwing the key around and it eventually landed in the gap behing the whiteboard. Now it can't come out. Oh the irony that the smartest boy in class would do the most stupid thing! Anyway for a moment he thought he was doomed but 'Oh my Saviour!' Kelvin turned out a duplicate key. Supposedly he was afraid something like that would happen and took the key for duplication, complete with yellow tag and class printed. He managed to dodge the estate for the weekend but yesterday someone returned late and the estate man took a look at the key knew it was a duplicate.  Ahh... Control freak Kelvin gets into trouble for trying to handle too many things at once. Another person's in charge of the key, but he, with his OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) about trying to be all responsible and running the class, has taken over since the start of the year. How much you want to bet he'll push the blame?  Oh yeah, more on class happenings... Toh Siew Tee, my Bio teacher stopped me after class today and told me I got full marks for the test. And she was giving me this toothy grin that reminded me of Dobby the House Elf. To think Kelvin Chen was actually trying to surprise me by studying and attempting to hit me off the Bio topspot! LOSER! I just have a feeling that the 'Don't talk to me!' is going to come out of my mouth very, very soon...
By  Ethan Alter   There's one thing you can say for sure about Bob and Joyce: These senior citizens definitely don't look like your typical Internet-dating couple. Still, the latest team to face Philimination on CBS's The Amazing Race (Tuesdays, 10pm/ET) was also one of the most popular thanks to their upbeat attitudes, strong racing skills and all-around good-heartedness. Here the New Jersey natives reminisce about their first date, and look ahead to the future.    Ethan: So tell us the story of how you met.    Joyce:  We met through Match.com. I had been a widow for a long time and didn't have much of a personal life. I was raising my three children and working hard. My son, who is a software engineer, told me, 'Mom, you need a life. Go on the Internet. It's the only way you'll be able to do this.' And I said, 'No way.' But he insisted and helped me put my profile on Match.com. Lo and behold, Bob came on...   Bob:  And I saw her profile. Actually, I passed over it several times because she looked like a girly girl and I was looking for someone who liked outdoor things. But one day, I read her profile and it said she likes outdoor activities. So I sent her an e-mail and the rest is history.   Joyce:  For our first date, we had drinks at a local restaurant. Afterwards, Bob walked me to my car and when I got in, I thought, 'Yes!'   Bob:  I got back home that night and my daughter walked in. She knew I had had several dates on the Internet and so she asked, 'Well, how'd this one go?' And I said, 'This one went really well.'   Joyce:  We knew immediately that this was going to be a long-term thing. The race just sealed it.   Ethan: Whose idea was it to apply for TAR?    Bob:  [Raising his hand] I was a fan of the show and, actually, I was already planning to do it with my brother-in-law. My hook was 'Meet two brothers-in-law who actually get along.' But then, I met Joyce and thought, 'This will be a lot more fun.' I knew she would go along with the application and I knew we were going to get picked. Two widowed people who met on the Internet and are active â we've got a few things going. Joyce didn't think so. Then we were picked.   Joyce:  And I was like, 'I really have to do this now! What in the world did I get myself in to?' But I would do it again in a heartbeat, as long as I didn't have to eat any more caviar!   Ethan: Yeah, that caviar challenge looked positively brutal.    Joyce:  It was awful! We had already decided that I was going to do all the eating challenges because I eat virtually anything, and I do love caviar. But when I saw the amount of caviar, I was shocked! When I first started eating it, I was like, 'Okay, this is gross, but I can eat it.' But after a while you felt like you just had to throw up.   Ethan: Since you're both so Internet savvy, are you thinking of putting up your own website after the show is over?    Bob:  I don't know. It would be nice to hear 'Hey Bob and Joyce, I took your advice and I met someone.' That's part of our story. We hope we can encourage people to take a chance and get out there and try again. Maybe they can be as lucky as we were.   Joyce:  I would like to do that, if only to give people like us a means of support. If you are widowed or divorced, it doesn't make a difference how old you are. Put yourself out there. Take a chance. Every day is another experience. I tell my children this all the time: 'Do something every day that scares you and you always will remain fresh.' Bob laughed at me when I first told him that.   Bob:  I had heard to do something that scares you every once in a while, not every day.   Joyce:  Every day!   Ethan: Knowing what you know now, what would you do differently if you ran the race over again?    Bob:  We'd probably try to work with the other teams a little bit more. Also, don't always believe the information you're given. Double-check and triple-check everything.   Joyce:  Definitely stay connected to the other teams more; you never know what you can pick up. And the teams that are racing are very smart. It's so nice to see young people with so much intuition and the absolute moxie to put themselves out there and work it.   Bob: Overall, we're happy with the way we ran the race. We didn't want to screw anybody over or embarrass our children or ourselves. We knew we had a life to come back to after this â that was always in the back of our minds. We felt real good about doing the race the way we wanted to do it. And I think we had more fun than most people!   Joyce:  Because of this experience, Bob and I are going to backpack in Greece next year. You can go anywhere in this world â you don't need a tour and you don't need luggage. You can carry everything you need on your back.   Ethan: So now that you've survived the race together, have you taken the next step?    Bob:  We're not engaged yet, but we're confident that we have met the partner we want to spend the rest of our lives with. We're taking it a day at a time. This is real.   Joyce:  This is for real. We'll be together. He knows that and I know that about him. What will follow will follow, and we'll just take each day as it comes. I always said I don't need $1 million, because $1 million is fleeting. I got the biggest prize of all: I got Bob. It sounds corny, but it's true.
Can you believe it? I actually went to Geylang yesterday, cause my dad wanted to try something new and there was like the supposed food haven. It was really an experience for me, cause I kept thinking of Amazing Race possibilities. Now who said Amazing Race could never come back here cause there's nothing left to do?  We were kind of stuck trying to find an illegal carpark somewhere along the street, cause there was no friggin space. My mom was wondering why people were starting to wear Red Shirts so early, something that I really laughed hard at. It's not like Christmas which starts early at November, mom! Apparently the prospect of National Day parade preview had never occured to her. Those cheap Singaporeans are out only for the freebies, who cares which day you go on?   Ok... Enough with the Singapore bashing, which will cease for the moment cause everyone that's feeling so patriotic will kill me. We went to this apparently famous for seafood restaurant, where there seemed to be some gravy left on the 'cleaned' table by a very generous previous patron. I sat as far away from the table as I possibly could without looking too snobbish. My usual elbows on the table were drawn uncomfortably to myself. I drank the tea, which had some black dust inside. I couldn't help but to wonder whether it was cigarette dust or tea leaf residue. Unrealistic me... What are the chances of it being the former compared to the latter right? I don't even want to think about it.  The food was pretty good, but I much rather have stayed in the comforts of my home and da-paoed something from the Cze Cha just down the road. It apparently also got 5/6 chopsticks from Makansutra, which was the same as the restaurant we just went to. Anyway we got some of the famous Tanjong Rhu Pao and went back to our car. On the way back, we had to cross an overhead bridge. One half of the stairs leading up was occupied by creepy Indian men, and they all seemed so coordinated, sitting on one side. It was like in that childhood story, with the scary beast under the bridge that threatened to eat up anyone who tried to cross. We opted to brave the never ceasing current of cars instead.  There seemed to be some soliciting going on, right next to our car! The Indian man then proceeded to convieniently lean on our car when we were just a few metres away. I couldn't help but to pass a comment to my Dad saying, 'Dad, there's a pimp on your car!' The Indian Man pulled away, and they carried their dealings somewhere else. I can't imagine how many deals my car must have seen through the night. Anyway, that's all for my experience in Geylang! I still have some paos left!
If you ever see a random title, it's my opinions of the teams on each leg of the race. And it's starting to take form; the first one was Skrewts, a creature from Harry Potter. Now it's weasel. So if you just understood whatever the hell I just said, cheers for you. Here's the stuff!  Chip & Kim â The number one placing is very much undeserved. They have shown before that they are incapable of making flight arrangements. This week, they got lucky because Colin went all out to help everyone but Mirna. The thing is, you canât depend on someone every leg, and you wonât be number one on the finishing line just because you can eat caviar.  Colin & Christie â I think they are one of the most strategic players to ever be in this game. They, along with Brandon & Nicole, see Charla & Mirna as threats and decided it would be best to try and bring them down. I really donât like Colinâs dirty play, but itâs a really smart strategic move to try and get Charla & Mirna out early. Really, really bad choice getting a girl to eat when thereâs a guy in the team. Guys are always stronger at these eating thingsâ¦ Just look at Fear Factor! Christieâs emerging as really bitchy. I know youâre all frustrated at having to eat salt, but no need to take it out on your boyfriend and another team!  Marshall & Lance â Same thing as Chip & Kim. These two got lucky with Colin playing dirty. Youâre just pawns in his game, so watch out. I thought the âDonât talk to me!â comment at the bus station when Mirna tried to ask you a question was really uncalled for. I mean, Mirna was actually trying to be nice and you told her to shut her trap. As the only other guy to have eaten the caviar, you really let your team down by doing it so much slower than Chip. I love it when you declared to everyone when they asked whether placings were still being respected, shows that youâre actually thinking of ways to get ahead. From then on, you just rode the âColin helpâ wagon. According to the spoilers which have been accurate so far, these two go next weekâ¦ Letâs continue hoping!  Charla & Mirna â Rock on gals! These two looked to be in huge trouble this time, but they managed to save themselves again. They have proved that they can survive independently, without any alliances and without any help from others. I really respect them for that, but a few friends wonât do any harm. Mirna is getting on my nerves, but I like Charla too much to make this team budge from my number one spot. As I said in my summary, I donât know if they had secured on the connecting flight through Germany or just got lucky. If they indeed secured the Germany connecting flight, theyâre the flight supremos this season. The editors very unhelpfully forgot to tell us when the Swiss Air flight would arrive compared to Colin & Christieâs flight. The editors might be trying to downplay them, lest they stick out as the winners this season because of their superior flight arranging skills.  Brandon & Nicole â I hate their strategy so badly, and it doesnât seem to work. They make alliances that they know they will not keep, and benefit without benefiting others. I also hate the way that they keep proclaiming to be Christians. Christie said something to the effect of them being Christian, but they will be ruthless when it comes to competition. Something about playing well. Itâs like saying âIâm Christian, but I will not hesitate to lie, cheat and stealâ¦â What a hypocrite! Brandon, they one doing all the lying to alliances, states that he wants to live as an example to others, so wonât drink the vodka. So your living example would be to backstab whenever necessary? Stop contradicting yourselves, and stop reminding us youâre Christian! The fact that we know youâre Christian, and yet see you backstab people week after week is enough!  Linda & Karen â Queerly, we didnât see much of them this episode. Maybe theyâre not as interesting as I initially thought they were. I actually thought they are the female versions of Ken & Gerard, but now it doesnât seem so much like it. They donât have much skills in finding flights. I mean, Charla & Mirna jumped right to the front again with their skills, but you couldnât? Youâre losing your entertainment value in this season, and youâre not a very proficient team at the race. Your leaving would make more space for the more interesting teams to show!  Kami & Karli â Second to last, again? This teams physical capabilities has pulled them through so far, but their lack of brains will pull them down eventually. I really canât say much about this team, cause they havenât really been featured much. I admire the fact that they one doing the Roadblock was shivering when she was done. It was a much better reaction than giving up and sleeping like the other prom queens. Sheer grit and determination is what got her through. The comment about âWe hate getting pushed back alreadyâ was a redundant statement. If you donât like getting pushed back, do something about itâ¦  Bob & Joyce â Awwwâ¦ Last week I said that I was beginning to see why my friend liked them so much., and this week they are eliminated. I did say that they werenât showing much character and will need to go if they stay this boring, but I didnât mean this soon! Joyce ate the caviar fast, and she can be counted as a prom queen cause sheâs a skinny female. She didnât even flinch! We didnât exactly see Joyce finish the caviar, so I kind of think the producers were kind enough to tell her that theyâd already been eliminated. Bobâs words to her on the horse carriage sounded as if she was on her deathbed traveling around the worldâ¦ Errâ¦ I donât think I should be so mean to such a loving couple. I sincerely wish them good luck on their relationship, cause they look like theyâre going to be a real happy couple together.
Famous people are weird aren't they?? Its like they're not real people. I just went to the Craig David concert and the show was good (not as good as Prince mind you but I like Craig David better, and yes I went to that one twice on the weekend.)  The show was good, he was good, the seats were excellent!!..  It was all in all a good night... There was some trash on parade though, the outfits of some of the people were shocking!! Not to mention the ages, there was heaps of young girls and older people too. He reaches all people.. which is cool...  Anyway, what I was trying to say is that I think fame is a weird concept. We waited after the concert to see Craig David come out of the backstage door and after a long wait he eventually did. It was very weird to see him in person, in full view and in a normal setting, walking around, getting into a car.   And it must be weird for him that there were hundreds of people waiting for that..,.... I don't know what I'd be like if there were fans waiting for me to come out of my house every day or to go shopping, even for groceries..   I guess we take stuff like that for granted.. I don't know how he lives but it must be well even though it would be lonely..   And all those fans, wanting to know things about you, everything, to see you and hear you.. theres a bitter irony to it all...  but i guess i'll never know because I am not waiting to be famous, i only know what its like to wait to see somebody famous..   Prince was also a strange thing to see. We could see his face better as he had big screens and it was also surreal.. The show was much more 80s and funky, and the band was great.. Also, Prince ended up being on for 2 and 1/2 hours but Craig David was only on for 1 and 15 I think.. but he has less songs.  At Prince  everyone danced ... at this one, the fans were too reserved and only a percentage of the crowd stood up..   For the Prince concert I went because my boyfriend had a ticket that a friend had bailed on but we still had a good time.. he enjoyed it so much and I liked seeing him having fun, dancing and singing. That was on last friday night, the 24th.  Then the next night the 25th I worked at it and went in after with friends. It was less packed and had less of a party vibe.. so I was definitely glad that i went the first night..   So now am relaxed but had a big day, i'll write more later when I have the time..
Phew!!!  what a day./.....   Its week 12 at uni this week, so I am trying to organise 12 weeks worth of notes for 3 subjects and do all the reading, questions and learning..  Today wasn't bad considering it is my least favourite day. Something good happened for a change, which was good and has given me renewed confidence in myself.   It started yesterday though, when I got back an assignment I had worked hard on . The mark on the paper was 55. My tutor said she wanted to see me and said that it was one of the best reports she had read, and that it was well written and argued.   I thought to myself, 'am i hearing this right?'.. and told her I wasn't happy and that I wanted something to happen. I asked her if i could re do the assignment and she said she;d ask ...   so needless to say I was pretty fired up yesterday afternoon. ...  whilst on this fired up trippy thing i wrote email to the lecturer and course coordinator requesting to see him to talk about it..  long story short I went today and got him to read it and it was remarked too.. got 70!!!  I almost fell off my seat!!   The moral of the story is that if you know yourself, then no one can tell you otherwise. I knew I was capable of more than a 55  - I usually get average marks like 70 and in this case I knew it was worth about that...   Hehehe... what a day!   ;P
Just in case anyone is wondering.. (no one probably reads this anyway but to put my mind at ease)..  I didn't end up going out on the day of my birthday (which I said I was in my last blog before todays bloggs.) Because none of my friends could make it  - I ended up going out with my boyfriend and we saw Lara Croft Tombraider and ate Vietnamese in George st .. it was a nice date, and funny cause earlier on in the day a work friend had presented me with this huge buinch of flowers, the most beautiful, romantic flowers ever, two bunches of light and dark pink tiger striped lilys with green leafy stalks.. (shes a close girlfriend too) and wherever we went that night all the women everywhere would look at the flowers, drool and sigh and then look at my boyfriend as if he was the most lovely guy ever!!! Hehehe it was funny!!!     There was one point in the evening when I had to go to the bathroom after the movie and left boyfriend holding the flowers outside the toilets, and this girl approached him when I was inside, and gushed over the flowers and him!!! Heheh.....   But last night was a nice surprise.. it was about a week since the actual birthday, and last night went to the pub with school friends, as my friends from work couldn't make it..   But they surprised me and turned up and it was great!! They are the best, and the presents they got me are so nice I love them..   So thats how my birthday panned out.. (not that anyone is reading this... ??)
Argh.. so tired today. Went out for my birthday last night with friends from school and ended up at this break beat dj's set afterward... didn't get home til about 4am and woke up at 9ish...  They asked me what I wanted for my birthday and they got me 2 cds (which i requested) and this make up bag thing too for my pending trip overseas at the end of the year. Its pretty cool - its a surf brand one. But its just not really my style. But it is the thought that counts..  though.   I was supposed to clean my room and study today but as you can imagine i am sleep deprived and lying around falling asleep everywhere..   Its been a busy week..i got a lot done - i got my haircut and my nails done too so i feel pretty special..  also went to gym twice, worked two days and attended all classes, tutorials, and had my final commerce presentation ever... and handed in a 3000pg group report..  yay!!   going to rest now... @_@ i feel like a zombie... >.
Going to bed, have a long day tomorrow.  Working in the city, then meeting some new friends from Uni for drinks in the evening. I am looking forward to it very much..
My birthday is coming up (23) and I am feeling very bah humbug about it. I don't really want to be older, I want to stay as I am, because I know that I am unprepared.. Coinciding with my birthday is the return of Uni and I know that it will be busy.   There's so much going on in my life right now that sometimes I feel like i can't breathe...  I went to the John Mayer concert on the weekend and in amongst the crowd (it was a sold out event) it was strange that I experienced the physicality of what emotionally and spiritually I have been feeling for awhile.   I felt cramped in, hot, like my skin couldn't breathe, and just weary overall..   But it was the best concert I have been to to date.... entirely worth it..
I'm finally here.. I have a blog. Very cool...
If anyone is wondering, when I say ' there ', I mean that place that you thought you would be in when you were little and wanted to be grown up.  But do you ever get  there ? and what  is it ? Is it finishing high school? finishing Uni? Getting into a relationship?  I'm 23 and I always thought my life would be different to what it is now. I always thought I would have done so much by now, yet sometimes I feel like I've done nothing. I'm not there yet.. when will i get there?  When I was away, in KL, my cous said a funny thing. She was talking about her future (she has youth on her side) and all the things she would have acheived by the time she was 25. A house, a car, a high paying job. I laughed at her, and told her what the world really was like, that I was 23 going on 24 and had no house, a junky car and two lowly paying jobs, and no chance of getting them by the time I hit 25. She looked at me in disbelief as if I was lying to her, and I didn't know what to say. They were so important to her, I guess that was her 'it', her getting 'there' was 'it'.   I know that those things aren't important, maybe if I had them already I would think so, but I would rather not have them and enjoy life as it is for now than wish for something that is far away in the future.  I am dying to get away from this place, and see the world. More than just asia, I'd like to travel to Europe, Africa and America, to see what its like there. here, especially where my parents live, its a suburban existence. I go to the local malls and feel out of place because I don't have a pram with babies in it. Two friends of mine got married last year and that scares me so much. Lots of other people have asked me why, but to me its crystal clear - marriage is cutting yourself off from discovering things in this world, and entering into the 'suburban' part of your life. when you're married there's more than just you, and you sort of disappear into that.  For me, at this stage, I think thats 'it'; not getting caught up in the suburban existence; i'd rather be doing something life changing, for myself, that  I  want. Before that (suburban existence- husband, house and kids) I want to be a traveller and have my own experiences and discoveries, away from everything that is here and that I have always been used to..... and thats  it !!!
HiHi! Basically, I have to write something because I have been soooo darned lazy these past few months and my friend emailed me to say she'd be checking (how boring, Sorry Charmaine!)  She just told me she wouldn't be back for another 18 months, which I suspected because I think that London might be a little like KL, it sounds really fun and a lot of people that go there spend a longer time there than they thought they would.. my unlce spent 12 yrs there and he was supposed to study only!!  Plus its good money and travel prospects everything being so close and all. So this is essential to our keeping in touch..   The last few months, ok three (? i think) have gone past very quickly. I've been away from Sydney and my life here for 9 weeks and  it felt so  goood ...  I love travelling and seeing new things. Coming back has been a little hard actually, because it means i have to do things and get back 'on the ball'... just litle things, like the pile of mail, were hard to deal with, i open it, look at it, then put it back down.. have become really lazy and non correspondive (i know its not a word but ya know).. but the good news is that things are happening slowly. I have cleaned out my wardrobe and am proud to say I am up to date!! I threw away so much stuff I was ruthless!!  On the return journey I got sick, and got a cold so thats also why i haven't been doing anything, - the cold got pretty bad and i just lay in bed for a couple of days with jet lag and the fluey cold feeling of fuzziness.. then it turned into a bronchial cough, which i still have at times...   But about KL, I love it. Thats where I went and spent my time, with my family (aunties and cousins and uncles..) ..The shopping is awesome, and the food is also great. Its like they are more on par with America in some ways - just the franchise chain stores they have there are really American, like hot dogs, pretzels (we have those here i know) and others (they had this one where you could get a pizza flavoured crepe or banana peanut butter crepe all folded over and it was great! really crispy!)  Also the supermarkets are huge!! and the mallssssssss!!   But the funny thing is my cousins seem to be at that age (puberty  - all between 10-20) where they think they are doing everything right but they are really just being strange and silly! And Jay and I saw straight through them - don't know if its about the down to earthness of Australia or just my family..  Being back is a little tiring, cause I know that its back to the daily grind, wish I could escape and run away!!  Haven't worked much at all, both my workplaces seem to not have any work - its quite at TT and DM has already rostered everything up until March-  so have been trying to fill the 3 days i have off per week this session. By chance, got a  job interview  tomorrow with the firm my cousin is presently working for, so feeling abit nervous about it. Its a law firm so I am not exactly feeling confident.. and uni is finishing soon (6 mths) and then who knows?!... its just for more rounded work experience than customer service is all. Gotta try it...Can only try..   Anyway, thats all for now, sorry its so boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehehehe catch up more soon...
Does this count as a hobby?   I have decided, that I am going to become a person who has many hobbies. I've been feeling a little 2-D lately, partly cause a new friend asked me if I had an online journal, and i thought I did but after visiting his mine seems so.. well, 2D. I don't know if I want to show this to him.... his site was pretty good, it had all the interests and recent things that had happened to him.. and it got me thinking, what are my interests? what are my hobbies? I guess I just never thought about it before.  That may sound sad,  but when I asked my brother if he thought I had any hobbies, he flatly replied,  'your hobbies are friends and work'.  ahem.  Boring!! There's so much to me than that! Isn't there?  Music, concerts, Books, Games, AND friends and work i guess.  Well i guess going to concerts was a bit of a habit last year, and i'm sure it will be too this year. Last year I saw Groove Armada, John Mayer, Michelle Branch and (not really my choice but circumstancial attendance)  Prince, Shaggy and Craig David.  I guess thats somewhat attached to work though, so does that make it a hobby still??   And i went to tropfest last week, which was excellent!! it was a big thing in the domain where they showed short films and everyone brought picnics with wine, cheese, and other miscellaneous picnic food. It was great, lounging around watching the short films.. great stuff.  So I guess I do have hobbies,  and interests, just don't have a site about it.
I had a great weekend. Bianca is back from Moree and there are lots of social activities happening! Drinks Friday night, got very trashed and sent out some drunkend sms and took P & D (formerly P & T, who is still a little upset) to meet my friend Peter at his work. I was a little trashed, on the way home ate 3 burgers (thats so gross) and so began a bad spell of late night eating binges. Stayed over in the city, went home the next day and that night went to the John Mayer concert at the Entertainment Centre.. it was the best thing ever! I love John Mayer, and so do alot of other girls and women..   But the lyrics, they are the best.. and I wish I had written down his set so i could remember it better, I was so scared I'd forget about it when I was watching him. We had excellent seats, mine was directly in front of him, first elevation entertainment centre.  Awesome Awesome... i bought the live CD any given thursday, and a sticker for my brother... A friend of mine surprised me with a ticket it was so lovely..  but we went for supper after (bad) and had korean (which was good) but I didn't get home till about 2, then had to get up to work at brookvale the next day.. (tiring)..   I have been floating around with a sea of John Mayer lyrics in my head all day.. and was all weekend..    'If only my life was more like 1983'     Whatever happened to my Whatever happened to my Whatever happened to my lunchbox? When came the day that it got  thrown away and don't you think i should have had some say  in that decision.........    He also talked quite a bit.. i really like him, he has a funny sense of humor and this way about him that is familiar.. He was doing an impersonation of his mother it was so funny.. you can tell that he's really clever and witty... quite taken with that.. want to go to New York to see the city he lives in, if it has the same vibe.. and want to try to explore some  more music.. jazz especially.. *sigh*...
Wow.. Time has flown, I have done so many things in the past few weeks don't know where to start. Well, I got the job at the law firm, and am there 3 days part time helping them out answering phones and photocopying, filing etc.. mail run in the afternoons after lunch.. its easy work sometimes hectic and the ladies are really nice (its actually an all female office, and one man). They are all Malaysian Chinese which is funny cause I have never worked in that kind of environment, but only had dinner parties family things in that type of environment. Lorraine one of the solicitors brought in curry puffs the other day and they were so nice! And Florence is from HK, she is always going for milk tea and they always buy me one!  But have been really tired the past week cause Ticketek has been pretty busy. Poor Dave I have been no picnic this week.. Last weekend I worked all weekend and this weekend I also worked, the Easter show is on at the moment and its been pretty hectic, I have been supervising lately so its a bit nerve wracking having people actually look to you for advice all the time.   But today I went out with Brian, Deepa, Katie and Carol (Brians flatmates). They are so funny and Carol had never seen the Opera house or Harbour Bridge so I made us go there - she liked it. We had dinner at Darling Harbour and also had yum cha at Chinatown in the morning.. The thing is, they spoke Mandarin alot and it was a litte confusing, I felt so left out and can't imaging how Deepa felt, I actually had to interrupt them and ask them what they were speaking about at dinner tonight. I felt so rude but they shouldn't have been speaking in front of us like that, especially with Deepa there. The fact that she came is quite refreshing, that she is willing to make contact like that and go out of her comfort zone to hang out with me was so endearing. Shes such a sweetheart.   Bee's back from Moree, and its so good to see her again. We went to the Easter show yesterday and it was sooo much fun. Me and Dave and Annie and Bee went on the ferris wheel and Annie was so scared she was clinging to the sides and doing deep breaths with a whhoooaaahh!!! whooaaahh!! and screaming!! hehe she is great fun.. We got our faces painted - I got a butterfly, bee her's painted like a fairy/showgirl and Annie got her's as a cat, pink to match her jumper, complete with black kitten nose with a splotch of glitter. So cool.. Ppl kept looking at us like we were strange but then smiling to themselves.. i think secretly they wanted to also but didn't have the guts..   Going to sleep now, on a last note we saw this alpaca yesterday and it was so dead to the world sleeping that it was sitting down but had its head flat on the floor in the hay, conked out.. it looked so funny.. i wish i had taken a snap.. thats what i feel like doing for the next 9 hours..
Hehe regarding online journals, I was speaking to my cous online last weerk and we were talking about online posting and journalling.. The reason why I thought my site wasn't up to scratch is - there's layers ... outer and inner.. And this is my inner journal, not an outer.. I should have realised by the glib, trendy-ness of that guys journal (who i secretly think is now a bit of wanker anyways) that it was an outer, or 'public' journal as my cousin put it....  and who has time to make a cool trendy journal for ppl to look at and say, 'hey, cool journal'!??
*Sigh* Not a good way to start a post i know, but its how I'm feeling right now..  The interview this week (i can't believe it was only this week, feels like forever - its sunday night and it was only 5 days ago) was well, it was a little odd to be honest. The first round was easy, I knew that I was doing well, but this second round, truthfully I don't think I was that impressive.   I arrived at the place a little early and like last time, was surprised to find that there were others there that had been there since the morning.. (another batch of recruits).. why am I always surprised?? I have no idea..   I am so naive like that.. They made us go into this small room, and sit at tables and prepare an individual case study. Mine was about car heaters and the production line, and at first I had no idea what to do. I read it a couple of times to get the info into my head since it was swimming from the excitement.  Then, as soon as it was done, they made us wait before we were taken away to do interviews...   There were three people that interviewed me - Wayne, Barry and a lady whose name I can't remember.  I did my presentation and felt stupid doing it to be honest, since it only went for about 8 mins, we talked about the problem and how to fix it. and then about other things also.   They asked me what my best subject was a uni - wasn't quite prepared, said strategic management. I should have said Business in Europe but i thought strategic mgmt sounded better.  it was still a D  - and worst - chemistry.  andyway, i felt a bit naive, i'm this thing that hasn't been out of uni or had a real job and i'm speaking to these ppl that have worked with the company for almost 20 years, and the lady 7 months. she commuted and said she was getting tired. said alot of ppl did it, which is reassuring.  The rest of my week was a real blur. Wednesday I had lunch with Justin, and it was fine, we have always gotten on well. But then on Thursday I was with Dave and we bumped into Justin and he looked sort of surprised, and he hasn't emailed me since ( I had sent him an email wed night).. he was with a girl, a pretty little girl, and they looked pretty uncomfortable. Which was weird. I am not sure how I feel about it really, I felt a bit down really but thats silly cause he knew new I had a boyfriend (as did I, duh!), it wasn't a secret.... sigh,... i don't know.. all i know is that sometimes there are ppl you've always been drawn to and i just don't want the progression  of our friendship to change now that he's met my boyfriend.. he could have just been really busy and not had time to email.. But i don't know whether or not to contact him or wait till he contacts me.   Thursday night i stayed up til 2 writing my assignment presentation which is tomorrow.   ARGHHH!! My LAST presentation for uni!!! YAY!!  Dave's bday was on Friday and i met him for a drink with his work friends. They are nice, very Australian. Then Dave and I went for dinner at Wagamamas and we got lots of little side dishes.. came home to his place, he fell asleep (cause he had had so many beers), and I went home..   We are getting along a lot better now, we were fighting a lot (or I was) for the last couple of months, somehow he was really annoying me by just being himself.. I am not sure if thats ever happened to anyone else thought assume it has. Although I was feeling a little down this week, I am not sure why. He has been very patient and understanding through it all, even though I was horrible..   I bought him towels and a bathmat for his bathroom. He chose them he's getting quite good at it really. They're really nice, his little apt. is very coordinated and relaxing to be at.. Last night we went out with his parents, they're up from Vic and it was like old times. They sure can drink though.... After we saw them last night I was trying to teach Dave some Canto phrases. He's not bad, but its so weird hearing him say things!! But i like it.   THats all I have to babble on about this week..   Tomorrow starts another cycle.. it never ends.   week 12 at uni only about 3 more till the end.   sigh...    Chaz, if your reading this, hope you're doing well babe.
Yep, thats right, I'm invited back!! Yahoo!! I have to go back on tuesday, and do a presentation to the line managers. Here's the paragraph from the email:   Congratulations you have been successful in moving through to the second round of the Masterfoods Australia/NZ Graduate Recruitment process, which will be held on the week commencing Monday 10th of May.   We will require three hours of your time, on the day highlighted below.  In the first two hours you will prepare a case study to present to Masterfoods Line Managers, followed by a half hour presentation of this case study.  Finally we will require you for an interview to commence immediately after the conclusion of your presentation.   Its a bit daunting! But so exciting! I'm ready!!   In other news, nothing much else is happening, except that I clumsily sprained my ankle whilst coming home from the station.. I had plannned to go to Bowral to see school friends but that came to an end. Tonight is Allys Bday party, i didn't know what to get her (the girls all went in and got her something already, didn't even ask me) so I just got her this hand cream set with little gloves. I think its so cute but i don't know, if she doesn't like it i guess I'll give her the receipt so she can change it... i am over caring what anyone thinks, if they are getting a present from me, they'd better just like it.   I think i'm good at presents, unlike some ppl (one yr the girls went in and got me a picnic basket - i already had one so now i have two cause i didn't want to rude and say anything)......and last yr i asked for cds and a toiletry bag for my upcoming trip and i got this white make up boxy thing which isn't really what i meant (and now lives underneath my bathroom sink in the cupboard as a general stoage thing), so i am going to have to be specific this year indeed...   Sigh.. Dave's bday is coming up and I have no idea what to get him. He is so hard to buy for! Particularly cause I think i am running out of ideas... He needs alot of things for his apt, like towels and a broom but i think getting those might be boring.  Hahah speaking of boring I asked him if he wanted concert tickets to the John Butler Trio and he said he'd like towels... so I guess towels it is then.. and I might take him for a nice meal... he loves king st wharf, as I do, his work always has these social club (yes he's in the social club) dos and the last one he raved on and on about!!! But i'm glad that he's enjoying his work!  Well, better go do some Uni work.. thats right I still have uni work...   BYE!!
I got a first round interview with Mars Inc..   Me..   when I got the email I didn't believe it so I printed it out..   When I got to the interview (after a week or two of apprehension) the lady, Narelle, told us that 3900 ppl had applied, and only 510 invited to attend..   So now I am waiting to hear about the second round.. and its killing me softly!!!!!!!!!   ALso, today I met this guy from my class, Jian Du. I have wanted to meet him for awhile but the opp never came up. I wondered about him for awhile now.. Eddy and I were at the Unibar and i saw him and his friend sitting there and waved, then went inside. After about 2 hours, they came over to us to talk and had a drink with us.  I thought he was from Shanghai but he is from Harbin, even further north, near Russia. Thats so cool, I have never met someone from there. He sais it is very cold.. His name is Jian Du. There was also another person I met today, a guy also , and he is from Penang!! His name is Sze Yen. Small world!!   Tonight has been busy even though I haven't done much, i caught up with Bee, Emma and Seri over the phone.   Got Gmail, and it had my name! Its pretty cool. Think I am going for lunch with Justin tomorrow.   Its mother's day this weekend and I am unsure as to what to get my mum..
I must keep up with this journal.. thats the whole point of having one, right?  I Graduated last week... it was very surreal, but also good to know that that part of my life is over, and the next stage is here. I am ready for the next lot of learning..  International studies, language, more nutrition, who knows what the future holds....................  ATM I am a part time paralegal !! and enjoying my time off...
Hey everyone,  This weekend we were very busy! And we've had a lot of help from our friends. Our neighbors, William and Marie, are very sweet to us and we're always doing something with them throughout the week. William works for a towing company and Marie is a stay at home wife. They live with William's mom, Ida, who is currently having chemo for her breast cancer. She's doing okay, and we've been to see her a few times at the hospital when she stays there. In any case, William and Jeff love to play Diablo 2 together and are constantly talking about the game. William came over on Friday afternoon and told Jeff he needed to move our car. Jeff was a little confused and William said we needed to move our car next to his tow truck so he can fix our flat tire. Yes, our tire was flat! We knew that we had a screw in the tire, but we hadn't gotten around to fixing it yet. Turns out there was a slow leak and so our tire was slowly loosing air. So William popped out the screw, used his tire repair kit and we were all set to go. And William told us normally he'd charge 45 dollars for his services but for us, all he wants is Jeff to deck out his necromancer on Diablo 2. Which Jeff does happily!  Saturday Jeff and I wanted to put up our new chandelier in our stairwell. We've had this chandelier in a box in our living room for about 2 months waiting to get a ladder to hang it up with. Our old one was, well, old. One socket was broken and it was missing all of the glass cups around the light bulbs. The house was built in the 70's and I think that was the original chandelier. Needless to say, we needed a new one. So we got it and it sat in it's box forever. We asked around and my boss at work, Tammy, had a ladder. We just needed to go pick it up to use. Much better than buying one or renting one! So we decided to go down to Tammy's house and pick it up. We took Cinder with us because Tammy had been wanting to meet the puppy. She has a puppy too so we've been swapping stories at work.  We got to her house, and her puppy did not like Cinder, but Cinder was fascinated with Coco. Coco is a Chihuahua and Cinder is bigger than Coco and all Cinder wanted to do was play. But Coco would have none of that. We laughed a lot at them while we were cleaning off the ladder.  And then we tried to get the ladder into our car. We opened all the doors, the windows, put the seats down, everything. No such luck. We thought about tying it to the top of the car but that's a little dangerous. Tammy graciously offered to let us use her van for the day. So we loaded the ladder up, and drove back home.  Jeff got the chandelier up in about 2 hours. It looks fantastic. It's sort of a rustic look, blackened copper and clean lines, no flashiness. It has brightened up the stairwell a ton. In light and in style. It makes the house seem that much more put together. It's amazing what a nice light will do in the house!  After we dropped Tammy's car back off for her (no Cinder this time), we went to Tyson's Corner, a fantastic mall in our area, and bought Jeff new Sunday shoes. His old ones had split off from their soles and you could see his socks through the toes. So new shoes were needed! We found some nice ones at a shoe store in the mall. We also got some things that I needed for Primary on Sunday.  We also went to Target to get another light for our extra bedroom so when people come to stay, they have light in their room! We also got a few bathroom fixtures like a towel rack and a toilet paper roll. A very productive trip. :) We had dinner in a Mexican cafe right near there, and walked around the lake in the shopping area.  When we got home, Jeff put together the lamp and hung the bathroom fixtures while I played with the puppy. All in all, a busy and productive Saturday.  On Sunday, it was my Sunbeams' turn to teach sharing time, which means it was MY turn to teach sharing time. I was really nervous about it. Our theme for the month was 'How can I strengthen myself and my home through faith, repentance, and prayer?' So, I looked at the sharing time helps on  urlLink http://www.lds.org  and came up with one using the shield of faith and darts. See D&C 27: 15, 17. Jeff and I made 'fiery' darts from pipe cleaners and I taped them under a few chairs in primary. For every dart, I had something that could harm the faith in our houses or ourselves like 'You've just come home from church and your friend wants you to go to the movies with him. What should you do?' or 'You're really hungry and your mom is busy doing laundry. You want to eat lunch as soon as you can. What should you do?' That one got a lot of interesting responses. Ranging from 'make something yourself' to 'don't be so hungry!' In any case, Jeff made a shield out of a poster board and we wrote faith on it and had the kids who didn't have darts, come and hold the shield and respond to the problems. It was very cute and they had some really good answers. It went really well and I was pleased about that.  My Sunbeam class is growing in leaps and bounds! I started off with just 2 girls, and I now have 4 little girls (Shelby, 4, Kennan, 4, Katy, 3 and Hannah, 3) and a boy who is visiting for about a month (Zach, 4). They keep me on my toes. Their lesson this week was on I am thankful for my home. I was talking about a picture of a blossoming tree and they all piped up that it was the popcorn-popping tree! So we sang the song, and they proceeded to talk about what type of popcorn they had at their house. It was funny, but WAY off the topic. We got back to talking about who lives in trees and went from there. One thing that I introduced a few weeks ago as part of the lesson is selling Joseph into Egypt as a game. They each took turns being Joseph and everyone who was left were his brothers. I was the pharaoh, and the 'brothers' sold 'Joseph' to me and then came to ask for food. It was a very cute game and we have played it every Sunday for a month. Who knew it would be so popular.  We were able to play Diablo 2 with my dad as we do every Sunday. I think Dad and I died about 10 times. Good thing we're not hardcore players or we'd loose everything every time we died. We really look forward to playing every Sunday with Dad. :)  Sunday night we watched some of the Olympics that we had taped earlier. I've been following the swimming, and of course, the horses. We watched the stadium jumping finals and Germany won. USA came in 4th by like .2 points. I just enjoyed watching all the beautiful horses!  That's all for now! Check back frequently for updates! :) Love ya all, Catherine and Jeff
Hello all,  This is the first post on my blog I made to keep everyone in touch with what Jeff and I are doing out here in Maryland. I know we don't keep in touch as much as we'd like to, and I thought that this would be a good thing to let everyone know what's been going on with us. So, just a quick overview and then I'll get up to date.  Jeff and I moved out to the east coast almost exactly a year ago. Although at the time we moved to Virginia to a nice apartment complex called Windsor at Potomac Vista in Woodbridge. It was a cute, 2 bedroom apartment on the second floor with a washer and dryer! My favorite thing in that apartment. We stayed there about 8 months and then moved to Maryland.  Why did we move? Well, in those 8 months that we lived there, Jeff got a job as a systems engineer at Lockheed Martin ( urlLink http://www.lockheedmartin.com ). The job was in Gaithersburg, MD and we thought it wouldn't be too bad of a commute for Jeff so that we could stay where we were. Boy were we wrong! He had a 2 and half hour commute one way, so that was 5 hours a day he spent trying to go places. We thought, 5 hours driving, 40 hour work week, and him going to school full time was too much. So we moved.  We decided to buy a house because the interest rates were fantastic and we would be paying just as much with rent as a mortgage payment. So we took the plunge! We used Weirchrt Relators and found the house we bought the very first day out looking. It was just what we were looking for. 3 bedrooms, 2 and a half baths, with another washer and dryer. Very important, those washer and dryers. :) So on April 1, 2004, we closed on the house and moved in! Jeff now only drives 10 minutes to work every day and is able to go home for lunch every day. Lucky dog.  So that pretty much brings us up to speed on where we are. Now on to what we're doing. We bought a Cairn Terrier puppy soon after moving to our house. We named her Dogwood Cinderella, Cinder for short. She was so sweet as a tiny puppy, and now she's just so much fun. She loves people and can do all sorts of tricks. She can sit, stay, lay down, speak, and shake. The shake is adorable but she sits and lays down the best.  We just celebrated our 3rd anniversary with a trip to West Virginia. It was beautiful. This summer has been nice and restful.  Coming up in our lives is school for Jeff. He'll continue at George Washington University as a grad student. This will be his last full year. I continue to work at Genetics and IVF ( urlLink http://www.givf.com ) in Fairfax, Virigina, making apointments for either infertility and prenatal genetic testing. Boy have I leared a lot!  We've been enjoying our time here in Maryland! More updates to come!
Mornin, y'all.      Interesting bits in the news this morning. First off, over 750 fell sick while visiting South Bass Island in Lake Erie this summer. They're not sure what to blame it on... hm... could it be partly because the Great Lakes are some of the most polluted waters in the nation? You stick your hand in the cesspool, you ain't getting it back. It's almost as bad just to breathe in the sea spray. Or- it could be a dirty restaurant worker who failed to wash their hands after a potty break... You see why I don't like to eat at restaurants so much anymore? A pube in the food is enough to turn any stomach.      In other news, the porn industry may require their participants to wear protection. And it only took how many outbreaks of the clap and AIDs to spark this course of action?       Well, another interesting night in the Olympic arena. A white man can  run , and fast. Hats off to Jeremy Wariner for disproving all sports analysts and 99% of spectators who thought a white athlete would never beat a sprinter of any other color.       And- would you believe it- a  raucous  night in gymnastics?       It seems that the crowds have gotten tired of the scores that the judges are giving. After a practically perfect vault from Romania's Marian Dragulescu, the judges almost  begrudgingly  gave him a 9.9- I can't remember the last time I've seen a 10 in this sport.   No one in the world can vault like Dragulescu. No one can stick a landing after a front triple like Dragulescu. A 10 wasn't in the cards, but he's supposed to be happy with a 9.9?    At that point, he was sitting pretty ranked #1. After his score flashed, he hid the disappointment, but fell on his landing on a vault that should have been a walk in the park. You tell me that he wasn't affected by his score.    Move to the parallel bars- same story. A flawless performance by Hiroyuki Tomita was surpassed by a gymnast who was far less powerful and daring. On high bar, Alexei Nemov completed an unheard of six- count 'em, folks,  six-  release moves and stuck his landing. What was his score? 9.7 . It was enough to rile up the crowd and boo the judges. It lasted for ten minutes, postponing Paul Hamm's routine, until Nemov stood up and urged the crowd to stop. Hamm's performance was nearly void of any discrepancy, but in my opinion, not good enough to surpass Nemov, which he did. Unsurprisingly. Hamm won the silver, Nemov's score was enough to send him home in 5th place.    It was a Malaysian judge who didn't think Nemov was good enough for a medal. Didn't you all know? Malaysia is the world's leading producer of first-rate gymansts! Sure are- they keep 'em all in a box underground and they're planning a release in time for the 2012 games.     In other news... I haven't suffered a wedgie yet today.    Peace.

Hello again, y'all.  I can't resist making a comment or two about Svetlana Khorkina, the russian prima donna of gymnastics.  It seems that Svetlana is pretty sore about losing the all-around competition to America's Carly Patterson last week, and has taken to vocalizing her opinions to a russian newspaper. See, she feels that the judges had predetermined Patterson as the winner, and in her words, 'fleeced' her for the entire competition.  Let me take a step back. Khorkina is a product of the russian sports machine. They've churned out numerous gymnasts, divers, volleyball players, and wrestlers, among others. In a country that is too poor to support its once to be reckoned with space program, they invest everything they can into their athletes, and it has been paying off- until recently.  Alexei Nemov is the last man to my knowledge to win the men's all-round in gymnastics for Russia. Alexander Popov was 'The Russian Rocket' in Barcelona, Atlanta, and Sydney, but resolved to slink out of the pool after failing to qualify for events in which he'd previously been so feared in Athens. Rulon Garder defeated the russian wrestling favorite (can't think of his name, but this man was a BEAR) to win the gold medal. Now, don't get me wrong- these are all awesome athletes. They once dominated thier respective sports, but knew enough when they were defeated. I can't think of anyone who has acted as unprofessoinal and unclassy as Khorkina.  In Sydney, it was discovered that the vault had been set five centimeters too low and consequently sent Khorkina crashing to her knees. My heart went out to her. She fell off the parallel bars. Again, my heart went out to her. In Athens, she fell off the bars again. Guess what? My heart went out to her. When Patterson defeated her in the all-around competition, I felt a sense of sadness as I knew that it would be Khorkina's last Olympics. She paraded around the appartus, toting her flag, draping it over the parallel bars, acting like she has for the past ten years or so- the russian darling slash prima donna- a very fitting role.  She commented that the silver medal was grand, in so many words, and that it was the best day of her life. Yet, four days later, she's changing her tune and crying foul. Give me a break! Khorkina should wait to talk smack after the Olympics are over and stop falling off apparatus- then maybe she'd win the gold medal.  Anyone watching the competition can clearly see that Patterson was the most mechanically correct out of the entire field. She didn't fall, she didn't stumble. She deserved the gold and got it.  Khorkina has to realize that even though she is a sentimental favorite in the sport, it's not going to earn her medals. Near-perfect routines sometimes aren't even enough. It's a different scenario than Paul Hamm and the korean controversy- there, it was the judges screw-up. Here, it is Khorkina's screw up. Get over it, Svetlana. You're not the top dog anymore. The top dog won the gold, and even if she doesn't travel to Beijing to defend her title, she is still the Olympic champion.  However, feel free to come up with your own opinion.      If you're going to award gold medals to sentimental favorites because you feel they should get it, call Popov back to the pool and give him a couple. Give Jenny Thompson three. Hell, I have a lot of friends- give ME one.  Oh, wait- that's not how you're supposed to do it? Somebody had better tell Khorkina.        Peace.
Mornin', Y'all.      Six a.m. and I am tired.  Just woke up a half hour ago and I'm ready to crawl back under the covers and snuggle with my pillows.  Anyone else feel the drudgery of life like a vicious, neverending cycle?  Eat, sleep, poop, something like that?        I'm too old at 25 to live on the edge anymore, and on the edge I mean spending all my money at clubs and staying out til dawn, only to stumble into work still smelling like smoke and alcohol.  I did that for a while.  Some of my friends still do that.  Number one, I don't know where they get the money because we all make the same amount, and number two,  it should be old to them by now.    It's like those 35 year olds who still try to pick up girls at the club, all spiffy in thier silk shirts and tapered pants.  Just  old .      I start a new job with FedEx soon, and I'll be working creature of the night hours- seriously.  11 p.m. to 7 a.m. Sunday through Thursday.  Hey, I'm not complaining.  It means that I'll miss all the lovely traffic down the 101 every evil morning and all the little shits coming back from nights of crazy partying.  I am no so much concerned with hours as I am with making enough money to feed my belly and Jess'.  And maybe get that guitar I've been eyeing on Musicians Friend for a while- a Squier Strat, all black and shiny.  But that's not important.      Wonder what shift I'll work when I become a doctor.  I watched a show where this ER surgeon had worked mids for three years.  Now that's just too much.  I'm hoping that if I specialize, I can  sort of  make my own hours.   Someone tell me I'm dreaming- I don't know how this stuff works!      Anyway, anyway, anyway... Off to the place where I stare at a computer all day.  Hope this finds y'all well and behaving yourself.      Peace.

Ah yes, the summer Olympics are now halfway over. I've settled into the familiar routine of watching absolutely nothing but sports for days on end until three in the morning. In about a week, I'll be at a loss as of what to watch for a while and then I'll settle into another routine- the same one that I had  before  the Olympics.      There's always stories that come out of the Olympics that inspire, anger, satiate even. Already I can think of three.      I enjoy Michael Phelps. Not only does he have bragging rights, he  refuses  to use them. He loves to be part of a team. He credits everyone around him for helping him succeed in a sport where it's all touch and go, literally. He's one of the most composed and humble athletes I have ever watched, and it's absolutely refreshing. He swims all year-round to give credit to everyone, himself last.       Paul Hamm is said to have won the gold medal in the men's gymnastics all-around on a judging error, and that the medal should have gone to a korean gymnast. First of all, shut up. Paul fell onto his ass during a vault, sunk all the way down to 12th place, and was able to pull it together enough to medal. The fact that he did  that  should be enough. It's always the fat assholes who like to judge our elite athletes behind a microphone as if it's easy to compete at world class competition level against the best of the best. Who the hell is Al Troutwig? Has he ever competed a day in his life in gymnastics?      And Jenny Thompson. I've followed her swimming career for as long as I can remember. Everyone makes such a huge song and dance about how she's the world's best teammate, helping her team members to the top of the podium, but has never won and individual gold medal. Do they  notice  how fast swimmers are at this level? How close the races are? They speak of a second as if it's an hour. Give me a break. Jenny has balls the size of Manhattan to swim competitively while she's immersed in medical school. She's also suffered heartbreak this year after losing her mother. Again, fat bastards behind a microphone make it so easy to judge and point out flaws rather than significance of strength and courage.      I'd like to start a pestering squad to urge Jenny to come back just one more time for Beijing. Then, her critics will have to shut up. How many of them can swim 50 meters in under 25 seconds? Assholes.      I love them all, all shapes and colors and religions. They are beautiful, talented, hard working, and they deserve every accolade we can give them. They also help to encourage me to work out pretty hard for two weeks out of every four years.      One more question- who is this chick who calls commentary during diving? I have literally seen ten competitors dive into the water, produce absolutely  no  splash, and this Elfie girl will say something like 'Oh, no, she was short of vertical...' , 'Nope, there were three drops of splash that landed on the forehead of the chinese judge...' Anyone give me some insight?      You gotta love sport.      Peace.
Current Music:  Could It Be Magic - Donna Summer  Feeling:  blah  Ok, I'm late. Yeah and posting here since diaries.suchisthis, it's server, is being a bitch. Vicky and I headed to Kristen's house in the Bronx for a bbq. She lived far out but it didn't matter b/c we spent the night and it was worth it. Vicky and I ate a lot of chicken and hot dogs. But we  killed  the donuts. It was great but very  fullfilling , lol. Then soon as the hours went by we all went outside. Kristen's neighbors were lighting up fireworks in the middle of the street. It was cool and pretty at first but then it started to swift it's position. It went in the air but then as it went down it looked like it was going to hit us. I screamed my ass off and ran around the corner. There were many coming one after another. I think they did that on purpose just to enjoy our screaming of being terrorized. Kristen was just having a blast laughing at us. She was just standing there like it was no tomorrow. Hmm...let her ass get burned, lol, I'll be down the block. Later that night we had a ritual. A burning ritual. Lol. Vicky and Kristen were burning everything from plastic cups to pop rocks. Haha. It was great. I think Kristen has a slight fetish for hot wax. She kept pouring it on her from the candles outside. I was like what is wrong with you?? Do you know how hot that is? She was like it really doesn't burn. It feels so good. You should try it. -Pours-. *Lets out ahh.* :-/. I really worry about her. Then I was feeling a little darish and told them to flash the air. They only showed thier bras. Pussies I said. They were like well u haven't done anything yet, let me see you do it. So I did. I flashed the air with my feminine parts formely known as breast. =D. Then after burning half of the cups and ruining the poor cement we headed inside for the night. I was the 1st to take a shower. Then as soon as I get out Kris and Vicky both come in the bathroom and go in the shower...together...with thier clothes on. I'm like what in the world. They're like Sharice come in with us. It's gonna be fun so I get in, only I'm already washed and half a little towel on me. It was getting soaked so you know what I said fuck it and took it off. I was completely naked. It was great. Then they started washing thier hair. Vicky washed Kristen's and I washed Vicky's. Ahh those are the hightlights of the night. I had fun. It was the best 4th of July I ever had...yet. I'm out. Peace.    You are the Moon card. Entering the Moon we enter the intuitive and psychic realms. This is the stuff dreams are made on. And like dreams the imagery we find here may inspire us or torment us. Understanding the moon requires looking within. Our own bodily rhythms are echoed in this luminary that circles the earth every month and reflects the sun in its progress. Listening to those rhythms may produce visions and lead you towards insight. The Moon is a force that has legends attached to it. It carries with it both romance and insanity. Moonlight reveals itself as an illusion and it is only those willing to work with the force of dreams that are able to withstand this reflective light.

Hey. This one of the many things I have as an expression zone. I hope to update in this as much as possible. No one at all knows this blog I have. Hopefully it shall remain that way. Sorry for my rudeness. My name's Sharice but ppls call me Cherry.   What's On My Mind  Alex. Alex. Alex. I want him so badly right now and I can't have him. Uhh it sucks! I wanna reach out to him so badly the way I wanna do it but can't b/c he has a girlfriend and I can't do that. -Sighs-. Oh Alex, come back to me. I can make you so happy. I know he loves me (b/c he said it) and I love him. I'd do anything for him. Anything for him to be content.
Well, today is going okay. I have applied for a few jobs, done the bills and balanced the check book. I am currently a house spouse. I think I could get used to this. It's too bad I can't take this on as a full time occupation!  Cocoa, the cat, is in heat and won't shut up! She is normally a recluse but is now very affectionate. The poor thing doesn't feel good at all. the other two cats are nowhere to be found. I gues they are avoiding her. Soon they will be in heat, too.   The back yard needs mowed. I plan to get on that after I get a haircut this afternoon. My hair is so long I can comb it straight back like a gangster. It will feel so much better soon.  Sis called me to let me know the counselors at school think she will be one of the top ten juniors for grades this year. Go sis! The girl works like a demon to maintain grades while swimming and while working. She works harder than most adults. It should be fun to watch her grow up.
This is my first entry. I have long wanted to a place write down my thoughts but have never gone through with the process. Today I saw an article on Yahoo that talked about this web site and decided this would suit my needs just fine.  Today is my last Monday working for this company. I am a production planner. The company is closing operations in Mexico and our office, located in San Antonio, is no longer needed. I have worked for this company for twelve years, initially in Laredo Texas, and, for the last 10 years in San Antonio.  Losing my job has me filled with anxiety. I have two children, a nine year old son and a seventeen year old daughter. Although my wife has a good job, I am unsure of what our future will be. My daughter will be a senior in high school next year and will go to college the year after. How we'll pay for that I do not know.  My dad worked as a lithographer and lost his job when I was the same age my daughter is now. We moved to a little town in Illinois where I finished school. My senior year of high school was six weeks long. I had enough accumulated credit from the district I was in to graduate in Illinois and only had to wait through a probationary period to receive a degree. Knowing money was tight, I never asked about going to college but rather started working. My first job was with a company in Merriam Kansas near where I grew up. Finding myself in the same position now as dad was then is really scary. We kids never knew how difficult it was for him.  On one hand I am sure all will turn out well and on the other I am consumed with guilt for failing my family. I worry about how we will survive financially and how we will give to our children the things we want to give them. I look at mom and dad today and see two people that have survived the years still waking each day happy and with a bright outlook. I know, I hope, I will be the same when I am their age.  One of my brothers is currently searching for a job and it worries mom and dad so much I am reluctant to tell them about me. I feel so alone not sharing this but don't want to add the stress to their lives. They will probably be upset when they do learn of this but I'll accept that when it comes.  Luckily, the company is giving me a generous severance package which will keep us afloat until Christmas. I have started searching for jobs here in San Antonio. I will probably have to take a job outside my experience at much less money. Finding work would be easier if I looked outside the city, or better, outside the state. I won't do that as I have promised my daughter I would not move the family before she graduated from high school.
My son and I are visiting Mom and Dad. I have not been to their house in about a year and am overdue for a visit. It took 13 hours to drive here. Mom had dinner ready when we walked through the door. Spaghetti red, she calls it. It's pasta, hamburger, onion, and tomato sauce seasoned with chili powder. A staple from my childhood.  I came here to tell them about losing my job but find I cannot do it. My brother is still searching for work and I do not want to add to their worries.   Dad's breathing is worse. He and I went to the Walmart today and after walking from the parking lot to the store he had to sit on a bench to catch his breath. He has emphysema. His death looms just over the horizon. All the years of smoking have exacted a terrible toll and he knows it. It tragic to talk with him about the disease.  My son spent most of the day with Mom sorting quarters and filing them in albums. She is trying to get complete sets of the new state quarters for each grandchild. He was thrilled to be helping Gram. She was thrilled too.  We will be here one more day and will return home Friday. I plan to leave early so I can get home and clean the air conditioner that is having trouble keeping up with the Texas heat. The girls are home with all the windows open and the air turned off. Poor things must really be suffering.  It's eleven o'clock at night. I have sorted through e-mail and checked my lottery numbers(dang! Missed again!). I am going to read the news and go to bed. Tomorrow will be another day spent with the folks talking about old stories and old friends.

What a wonderful, wonderful world this could be. What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world. Donât know much about history. Donât know much biology. Donât know much about science book. Donât know much about the French I took. But I do know that I love you. And I know that if you love me to. What a wonderful, wonderful world this could be.  Donât know much about geography. Donât know much trigonometry. Donât know much about algebra. I donât know what a slide ruler is for. But I do know one and one is two. And if this one could be you. What a wonderful, wonderful world this could be. What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world  Now I donât claim to be an A student. But I am trying to be. I think that maybe by being an A student baby I could win your love for me. Donât know much about the middle ages. I look at the pictures and I turn the pages. Donât know nothing about no rise and fall. Donât know nothing about nothing at all.&nbsp;Boy its you that Iâve been thinking of. And if I could only win your love. What a wonderful, wonderful world this could be.  What a wonderful, wonderful world this could be  What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world  What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world  What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world  What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
When I see you on the street I loose my concentration. Just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation. Wonât you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you wanna know. Well Iâve been thinking about you day and night and I donât know if it will work out right, but somehow I think that it just might, if we try.  Faces come and faces go in circular rotation. Something yearns within to grow beyond infatuation. Wonât you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you wanna know. Well youâve got me standing deaf and blind, cause I see love as just a state of mind, and who knows what it is that we might find, if we try, and who knows what it is that we might find, if we try.  Were walking different directions from most people Iâve met. Youâve given me signs of affection I donât usually get. I donât want you to pledge your future, the future is not yours to give. Just stand there a little longer and let me watch while you leave.  âCause when I see you on the street I loose my concentration. And just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation. Wonât you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you wanna know. Well Iâve been thinking about you day and night and I donât know if it will work out right, but somehow I think that it just might, if we try. Somehow I think that it just might, if we try. Yes somehow I think that it just might, if we try.

It's not Firday the 13th. Mr. Lago was absent. And the bullies were suspended. But Me and my friends really did have some bad luck today!      First, we haven't finished our project in English, which will be submitted tomorrow! My friend, Jerelynn and Russell was left by their bus. And me and my other friends were stuck in school because of the rain. So what we all tease each other and do some crazy stuff. The only thing we did is to talk, chat, talk, and chat the whole afternoon, we were the only one left in school because it's halfday.      It was almost quarter to 3 so we all just recorded our voice in the radio, and we dubbed all afternoon. We was so noisy that the teachers in the faculty room almost heard us. But we still talked and talked. We were getting really noisy, so our school directress ( which we call the 'penguin' ) heard us and started calling Mang Bhay ( our school's head janitor ) when we heard her voice, me and my friends started running, and we hid at the back of our school's canteen, but 'BULAGA' one of our janitor in school saw us. So we all run to get our bag and head off the school's gate. I was getting my radio so I was at their back when our english teacher saw me. I acted as if I didn't heard her, but I saw her furious face so I ran to catch up with my friends.     We were in the gate and were trying to find some umbrellas we can use to protect our head and our uniform from the rain. Then when we had a glance from our back we saw 'THE PENGUIN' coming, so even wothout umbrellas we ran in the streets with only a folder on our head.      So we thought were free from 'BAD LUCK' but we were wrong, we were all WRONG, when we was walking on the side of the street, this F****** jeepney splashed a mud in our skirts!      THE END grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Thoughts about the weekends' happenings in sports:  Ken Griffey Jr. of the Cincinnati Reds FINALLY got homerun #500 versus the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday.  A lot of people have been asking, 'Well, should Griffey make the Baseball Hall of Fame?'  I don't even know WHY people are asking the question: of COURSE he should!  Consider the numbers, first:  Only 20 players have ever hit 500 or more homeruns, and now he is one of them.  That's an elite group in my book, especially being the *6th youngest player (age 34) to accomplish the feat.  Griffey was also the youngest to get to 400, which is significant because it proves how much injuries over the last 4 years have really messed up a potential for a HISTORIC career, rather than a great one.  His career numbers, as of now: a .293 career batting average, .562 slugging, a .378 On Base Percentage, with 2143 hits and over 1438 RBI.  He's only 34!  Plus, he WAS the star player of the league in which he dominated (with Seattle) from 1993-1998.  AND he still has a good shot in the next 5-7 years of winning a ring (maybe even this year the way CIN has been playing).  Yeah, I think the guy deserves to be in the Hall.  Fred McGriff on the other hand, has played to long (19 years) and STILL doesn't have #500 (493), his RBI numbers are way too low for his career (1549), and he's just not as had an impact on the game compared to others that got in.  He is however.....  ....ON the hottest team in basbeall, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays!  Can you believe these guys have won 11 in a row?  I didn't even know until this morning that they won YESTERDAY, never mind 11 in a row.  Too bad they play in the toughest division in baseball. They are 32-34 this year and 10/5 games behind the Yankees.  But hey, where else can a fan feel good while saying, 'Look, we're ONLY 10.5 games out of 1st place!'  All in all, just be glad that Lou Pinella won't have a heart attack for another 4 days........  Noting that milestone, it also makes me cringe that the Red Sox are now ONLY 6 games above the Devil Rays in the AL East.  I'm not panicking (or at least not trying too), but the Sox usually make a June Swoon each and every single year, especially during interleague play.  I think, if you are a fan, the things you have to focus on the most is that we now have Trot and Nomar back (and they're starting to play better), our pitching is still better than the Yankees (but their offense is WAY superior, kinda the opposite of last year between these 2 teams), and the fact that if you're talking Wild Card, that Texas (a good, young lineup that has average pitching) and Anaheim (a team that was my pick to go to the ALCS earlier in the year, but with all of these nagging injuries around the roster, as well as suspect starting pitching, they'll be lucky to finish 3rd in the tough AL West) are struggling, and with the Minnesota Twins/Chicago White Sox (It's like division 1-AA compared to the other tougher division in baseball) 'battling' it out in the AL Central, I think the Sox will be OK.    They just need to make sure they win each series against Minnesota coming up, and the Yankees at the end of the month.  It's a marathon, not a race......  .....finally congrats to South Africa's Retief Goosen on winning his second U.S. Open in Golf on Sunday.  I watched and laughed as Phil Mickelson completely had a brain fart on the final two holes and not only lost the Open, but also the chance for a Grand Slam (winnign ALL FOUR major tourneys - Masters, US Open, British Open, and the PGA Championships).  This guy has blown more big shots than Tera Patrick on a glory hole video.  Good thing he won the Masters last month, otherwise ALL we would be talking about is how much of a choke master he is.  He's still making more money than most people combined, I think he will be fine.  One thing ALL golfers must be happy with: Tiger Woods becoming a non-factor all of a sudden.  After dominating the last few years, he hasn't even been CLOSE to any of the major titles, never mind winning them.  He barely made the cut this time!  Maybe Tiger needs to go back to the Army to train, 'Abu-Gharib ' style, or maybe have Nike make some super golf shoes or something.  I'll be in Cambridge tonight @ Derek Gerry's Mounting the Hump show at the Cantab Lounge on 738 Mass Ave near the Central Sq T stop.  Show starts @ 8, and is FREE.

From Friday's Boston Globe:     'Boston is too racist for me,'' he said. 'I couldn't play there.'    'Only what guys have said,' he said, 'but that's been going on ever since my dad [Bobby] was playing baseball. I can't play like that. That's not for me, brother.'  When it was suggested the racial climate has changed in Boston, Bonds demurred.  'It ain't changing,' he said. 'It ain't changing nowhere.'  They built a tunnel to honor Ted Williams in Boston. What did he imagine would be built for him?  'Nothing, man,' he said. 'I'm black. They don't build stuff for blacks.'  ------------------------------------------------------------  O.K., why does Barry Bonds have to go out of his way to diss my city, huh?  I'm sure if he was confronted on his improper grammer for the use of the wrod, 'ain't', he'd probably blame that on 'The Man' too.  Does Boston have racist undertones?  Yes.  Even the Red Sox do (The original owner, Tom Yawkey, was from Tennessee and a former plantation owner).  If you ever get a chance, read Boston Herald's columnist Howard Bryant's book, 'Shut Out'.  Great stuff about how the Sox were the last team in the MLB to have a black player (Yankees were 2nd to last.  You see?  We CAN beat them at something!).  That was also the famed tryout of where Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays, and Josh Gibson were on the Fenway grass and someone yelled out, 'Get those niggers off the field!'   The city itself has had a shaky history, I'll admit it.  We had the segregation of busing in South Boston during the 70's, the Charles Stewart dibacle, Bill Russell's house getting ransacked in the 'burbs, former Celtic Dee Brown being confused for a bank robber in a Wellesley bank when he was a rookie, and of course Malcolm X calling Boston, 'The most racist city in America'.    It's still somewhat uncomfortable to minorities.  Ever listen to WJAMN (Jam'n) 94.5?  Yeah, it's a 'Hip Hop' radio station not owned or run by black people.  Listen to it someday.  It shows because it sucks.  But the people in Boston arn't THAT bad!  This isn't fucking KKKtown, Arkansas.  For every one racist moment we have had, Anytown, MS has had probably around 20 to match it.  It's not like we're burning crosses on lawns or having different proms for white and black students.  Even black Boston athletes are being recieved more here than they ever have. And they feel more comfortable because of it. Look at Pokey Reese; corn rows n' all, he's by far the most popular player out of all of the new additions this year (AND that's including Schilling and Foulke).  Plus, if Barry had known Boston's history, he would have known that when the first federal census was enumerated in 1790, Massachusetts was the only state in the Union to record NO slaves.  He also said that Boston doesn't build stuff for blacks, where in fact, the African American Meeting house was built by the city in 1805 so blacks could have a church to call home (because they faced minor discrimination in white churches, and that was just by forcing them to the bleacher seats - but hey, at least the city acknowledged they're bigots!)  In addition to its religious and educational activities, the meeting house became a place for celebrations and political and anti-slavery meetings, including a famous speech by Socalist Frederick Douglas.  See, Barry?  We arn't so bad when it comes to racism!  Maybe if you came here and saw for yourself how warm of a city Boston is to minorites (And unlike in New York City, you'll even get a cab from the airport!), you would think twice about what you said.  Plus, we would EVEN build something for your arrival to prove we're not racist AND to make you feel comfortable.....  We'd build a needle.......a BIG GIANT needle.  You'll feel right at home.  Prick.
DID you see that god awful performance put up by the L.A. Lakers last night?  Phew, for an elimination Game 5 in the NBA Finals, they sure bent over nicely for Detroit like Last Comic Standing's Ant in the U.S. diving team's locker room (Kobe might have to get used to bending over if he gets convicted during this summer).    There are so many questions for the Lakers.  Will Malone retire (Yes)?  Is Shaq coming back (I think he is)?  Where will Kobe be in 5 months (I say he'll be on the Clippers........of the Eagle County Penal League)?    How about Phil Jackson?   Even last night while on the bench, he seemed to be so exhausted from managing so many larger than life egos and diffusing various time bombs for the last 5 years. Itâs kind of like my seeing my dad in the backyard when I was young, cleaning his 9 mm while drinking cans of Miller Lite, sitting around fantasizing about when I will finally be out of the house, then looking at me and realizing that Iâm coming back for another year.  I always said the one problem with the Lakers coming into this year would be their chemistry.  When you looked at their roster before the season on paper, and then looked at their terrible play last night, no one thought they would ever be saying things after the season like, 'Yeah, they picked up a Hall of Famer like Karl Malone, but the Lakers sure will miss Robert Horry.' or 'I knew the Lakers were done in January when they put 53 year old Horace grant on Injured Reserve.'  All kidding aside, at least those guys played together.  They were part of the system, they didn't try to be the star or say anything to disrupt the team's flow.  Even the young talent the Lakers have is promising.  Hell, guys like Kareem Rush and Luke Walton are the types of young talent you want to develop for your future.  Too bad they never got to shoot the ball, as Kobe was hogging it most of the time.  Kobe wasn't even doing what he does best - penitrating to the hole >:-)  I think Kobe and Shaq are done with each other.  They got their rings, had their moment, now it's time to part.  I just wish Reality TV pheomoneon would be the same.  These Lakers remind of you of every dysfuctional family that you see on COPS. Even during the Finals, they were constantly bickering, yelling and blaming each other in front of the police while at the same time incoherently denying that they just finished smoking a crack pipe.  Gary Payton sucked BALLS this whole year; he seriously needs to retire and get back to selling pot like he did in the early 90's.  They don't call him 'The Glove', for nothing (cause that's where the weed was in his car).   Hats off to the Pistons, though.  I took a poll on ESPN.COM that asked who was the biggest factor for the Pistons, and i voted for the WHOLE TEAM.  They just played together.  The coach Larry Brown got them to get what he was selling, and they sacrificed individual glory for the ring.  A real great season, a real great defense, and clutch offense........sounds like the Patriots!
Well, this is Sean Caulfield's new blog.  I am a comedian in the Boston area.  Hope you enjoy.  If you don't know who the fuck I am, check out my bio.  http://www.geocities.com/hiphopsanonymous/bio.html  I'll try to post something later when I'm done rolling a blunt.
A report out of  urlLink espn.com today says that Ricky Williams would have failed a drug test  if he would has played this year, serving a 4 game suspension (which means he's tested positive twice before).  And check out these pro-pot quotes (FYI, Ricky Williams has&nbsp;had a long bout with depression and was diagonsed with social-anxiety disorder,&nbsp;so he takes Paxil):    '(Marijuana) It's just a plant'       &nbsp;     &nbsp;   ''Marijuana is 10 times better for me than Paxil,'' he said.    From Dolphins head coach, Dave Wannstedt:  'We knew nothing about it,' Wannstedt said. 'I'm totally surprised and shocked again.'  He apparently has actually  urlLink gotten away with smoking weed while on the job for the last two years by drinking a masking agent that fools scientists on urine tests , and forgot to take this masking&nbsp;supplement this year&nbsp;before this year's round of drug&nbsp;tests(How can the Dolphins be suprised this guy smokes pot?&nbsp; Not only is he friends with Lenny Kravitz, he's got dreadlocks and admires the life of Bob Marley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Have they ever watched this guy at the lunch line?).&nbsp;&nbsp;   Masking agent that he used to fool the NFL (and ever since his retirement, has given tons of free publicity to)?    'Urine Luck.'       &nbsp;   That has to be one of the greatest names for a product, ever!    &nbsp;
So, Miami Dolphin running back  urlLink Ricky Williams is retired ; I say..............good for him!&nbsp; I totally support him quitting a life of football just so he can spend this fall/winter in the Fuji Islands smoking pot out of his bong.&nbsp; Especially since the fact that he was the best player on a team that plays MY favorite team (Pats), twice a year.  Although the timing is suspect, I again thank Ricky for waiting until Antwoin Smith AND Eddie George were signed on to other teams before he called it quits.  Maybe he is a closeted Pats fan, who knew?  The Red Sox need an outfielder since  urlLink Nixon will most likely be out for a loooooong time .&nbsp; I love Gabe Kapler, he's a good spot guy off the bench with great athletism and of course one hell of a right hand, but&nbsp;you you need someone who is more consistent with his bat, and has been in the playoff spotlight before,&nbsp;even though Kapler's hot right now.&nbsp;   I recommend either  urlLink this guy &nbsp;or ESPECIALLY  urlLink this guy .&nbsp; If FiInley goes to NY, that could mean Johnson is going right with him.  The DNC is here in Boston this week.&nbsp; My dad, who's a Republican&nbsp;cop that's working 24/6.5 (other .5 for sleep) shifts, commented on the chopper noise he's been hearing on his details:  'I hope John Kerry doesn't have any flashbacks about Charlie!'  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
First of all, what&nbsp;a turn-a-round weekend for the Red Sox!&nbsp;   They lose Friday night's game in a fashion that they ALWAYS do: Take the lead early, relenquish it via errors and a bad starting pitching performance by Schilling, then fight back to tie the game in the 8th just to lose it in the 9th under the cut fastball of Mariano Rivera.  This scenario has been happening for about 7 straight years.  Then something happened.&nbsp; Something I've never seen before.  Down 3-0 in Saturday's tilt, Bronson Arroyo (who's pitched better than his record and has more runs unearned than a tourist at a shitty* Mexican hotel) decides to hit Alex Rodriguez in the back with a change-up (which, if you usually want to hit somebody, you do it with a fastball).  *pun INtended  A-Rod tells Arroyo to go, 'fuck himself' (Thanks to Tivo for the mountless times I've watched this fight this weekend).&nbsp; Varitek, the catcher,&nbsp;tells him to, 'shut the fuck up'.&nbsp; A-Rod responds with about 11&nbsp;'fuck you!''s, and Varitek goes after A-Rod with a bitch slap,&nbsp;and then we got ourselves a brawl!&nbsp; Varitek takes A-Rod to the ground like he's his 11 year old brother, followed by Gabe Kapler absolutely bubbles up Tanyon&nbsp;Sturtze,&nbsp;(who was stupid in being the starting pitcher, going after the most atheltically fit guy on the team) who's now bleeding profusely like he's just gotten himself into a steel cage with Terry Funk.&nbsp; He has to leave the game, and in the process we knock A-Rod out of the game as well with an ejection......  SO, we win the fight........  NOW to win the game, which it looked like they wouldn't.&nbsp; After fighting back to take a 4-3 lead in the 5th, the Sox proceeded to walk about every Yankee hitter in the lineup and then fall down to the tune of 9-4 in the bottom of the inning.  But, this team, for the first time all year, shows some fight!&nbsp; Some spark!&nbsp; They come back to get the game close at 9-8 (followed by Nomar striking out, as usual).&nbsp; The Yankees get a homerun at the bottom of the inning and it goes to 10-8 into the bottom of the ninth.  Then, for the first time in a while, the Sox come back like they did last year.&nbsp; Nomar and Millar each get a hit (a rarity in the same inning), followed by&nbsp;a Bill Mueller walk-off homerun off Rivera in the 9th to take the 11-10 victory!  We win the fight AND the game.&nbsp; That's huge in for a momentum stand point.&nbsp; The Bruins did this 2 years ago, where they beat the shit out of Ottawa (at the time in 1st) on the ice and with their fist, then rolled off 10 straight wins.&nbsp; This is the type of game that CAN change things......if the Sox don't fuck it up.  It was really one of the more enetertaining regular season games, ever, in my history of watching sports.&nbsp; And it was a huge win for a team that needed it.&nbsp; Now they must continue to keep winning through this 12 game road trip to convince me, and the rest of Red Sox nation, NOT to open up the Thursday paper just for the Patriots articles.&nbsp;   Speaking off, good article here on the subject:&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/07/26/sports_crazy
'The Hit Dog',&nbsp;a.k.a former Red Sox 1B and SUV accident tester Mo Vaughn is now in a lawsuit with former teammate and current&nbsp;Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra over a confidential&nbsp;internet mailing list&nbsp;that that was alledgedly stolen by Vaughn's former agent which was&nbsp;used to solicit&nbsp;clients for Nomar's hitting clinic.&nbsp; (Story here:  urlLink http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/07/21/the_hit_dog_harmony_ends_in_court_filing ).  Apparently, everytime someone would open up the Nomar emails, they would get a huge amount of pop-ups.  &nbsp;
Rave : Gabe Kapler filling in for a 'hobbled' Manny Ramirez during the last few games versus Anaheim.&nbsp; I've always liked Gabe for the athletism and occasional hot bat he brings to the team.&nbsp; He's the type of guy the Sox usually don't have; they alwaysd go for the 'slow yet has homerun power' guys like Burks and Millar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's hope he continues his good play in Seattle. &nbsp;  Rant : Manny Ramirez's Hamstring.&nbsp; Is it bothering him?&nbsp; Is it a hoax?&nbsp; He is a robot like Dick Cheney?&nbsp; I really don't care, I just want the guy heathly enough for the Yankee series.&nbsp; He's so valuable, yet he at times can be SO frustrating with his often puzzled behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;Francoma ain't helping the situation.&nbsp; The type of guy Freud would have a ball with. &nbsp;  Rant N' Rave :&nbsp; David Ortiz.&nbsp; WHAT IN THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING!&nbsp;&nbsp; His good play over the weekend too just demonstrates&nbsp;how much the Red Sox need him, and why it was so unnessicary to throw 2 bats at umpires on the field after being ejected during Friday's 4-2 win.&nbsp; I'll say he will get a 5-7 game suspension.......but the appeal will last long enough that he&nbsp;will make at least 2 out of the 3 Yankee series this weekend. &nbsp;  Rant :&nbsp; Pedro, you're a funny guy.&nbsp; We love how you clown around in the dugout during wins.&nbsp; But during a blowout loss?&nbsp; Dude, you just need to chill and be a bit more professional.&nbsp; Or take some Ritalin. &nbsp;  Rave: &nbsp; A split in Anaheim over the Angels, very key.&nbsp; The Angels will come on during the enxt few weeks, so it was important the Sox came out even.&nbsp;&nbsp;They SHOULD take 2 games in Seattle this week, even without Manny.&nbsp; Seattle SUCKS. &nbsp;  Rant :&nbsp; Why haven't the Sox put in a claim on John Olerud yet?&nbsp; I like Dave McCarty, but Olerud is an excellent 1B who hits for average and is a seasoned veteran.&nbsp; He has had a subpar season with Seattle only because that team is older that the Bible.&nbsp; He might go under retirement, but still - the Sox need a guy like him on the team for the stretch run. &nbsp;  Rave : I don't know about you, but I would do a Shoppach, Alvarez,&nbsp;&amp; Nixon deal for Houston's Carlos Beltran ANY second.&nbsp; Love ya, Trot, but Carlos Beltran is a young star, and you're will always be an above average player who, in my mind, is damaged goods at this point. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Great job by David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez reppin' the Sox last night with 2 2 run HRs a piece in the AL's 9-4 romp over the NL.  A lot of people say they should of been co-MVPs, but Alfonso Soriano's 3 run shot really set a tone and put the game out of reach.  Plus, it was a HUGE blast over the rightfield wall in Houston.  I am so glad that guy doesn't play for the Yankees anymore......he's actually developed patience over the plate, which is scary.  Bud Selig wants the 'The winning league gets the home field in the World Series' thing renewed.  Of course he does, because he's stupid.  Not only does it devalue a win/loss record for the regular season, it also pins a square advantage to someone in a championship series via an EXHIBITION game!  That's like giving someone the White House just because he only won the state of Florida........  Going into Stage 10 today, Lance Armstrong is in real danger of losing the Tour de France for the first time in 5 years.  I've always found it ironic that in France's biggest race (a country known for surrendering and pissing on people), the leader and winner of the race gets a yellow shirt.  I don't know why everyone outside of the USA is in a tussle over Lance's alleged doping.  The guy had testicular cancer!  I think he's allowed to take steroids after getting a nut cut off!  If there's ANYTHING that critics should go after, it should be the fact that Lance has a huge speed advantage by being 2-3 lbs lighter for only having that one nut.  The critics sure dropped the  ball  on that one (ok, I'll stop).......  I hope Randy Johnson does come to the Red Sox, not only to help them win a World Series, but maybe he can put a huge dent into this over population of pidgeons we have in this city.  We used to have a big rat problem around here, but it got taken care of because those rats evoled and grew wings.  When you see 4 albino pidgeons having breakfast at *2* different Dunkin Donuts', they're fucking too much.  Pidgeons are the one of the many reason's the NRA could be a fun club to be in.  It would be like duck hunt, except the dog would be replaced with a cat.......armed with lasers.     Big series coming up in Anaheim this week.  And they need to win more than we do so they can look more attractive to the 'Big Unit'.  Speaking of being attractive to units, a sex video shot by a former husband of Baywatch blonde beauty Gena Lee Nolin (warning!  not work friendly! http://www.anothersite.co.uk/gena-lee-nolin.htm ) is out.  I was very impressed because it's her best acting performance she's had since.........wait, she could never act in the first place.  But she sure can play it up for the camera!  Now THERE'S talent!   Gena.....Hey now, you're an All Star!
Well, it's baseball's all star break, and we're 86 games through the season.  The Sox stand at a decent 48-38 clip, a game ahead of the wild card over Oakland and 7 games behind the Yankees, who I still think arn't that good.   Who would have guessed that the Sox AND Cubs would be 7 games behind in their perspective divisions?  These teams have so much talent before the season, that's like saying that Jimmy Fallon AND Nicole Richie will get Oscars by the end of the decade.  I was at the game yesterday, still pretty bummed how they lost.  Those umpires SUCKED, they had a major case of, 'We want to go home-itis'.    At least my DAG % (Drunkness At Games percentage) is still at 1.000.  Jesus HAS reincarnated himself as Johnny Damon (for now).  I mean, look at the similaries!  The hair, the closeness of the initals (JC, JD), and the many miracle plays over the past 8 games.  Now if he can only turn the warm Bud Light drafts at games into GOOD beer.......  Roger Clemens to the Red Sox, right?  Sounds good and look good right?  *SMACK*!  It's never going to happen......  Randy Johnson MIGHT still go to NY.......but odds are he'll go to Anaheim (if they play well in the next 12 games).  The Red Sox in my baseball season on EA's MVP BASEBALL 2004 are 60-26.  I'm the man, and so is Nomar, who in my season, is hitting .354 with 34 HRs and 70 RBI with a .400 OBP.  Barry Bonds is hitting .415!  NCAA Football 2005 comes out July 15th.  Madden 2005 comes out 2 weeks later.  Two MORE reasons why I don't need a girlfriend........  Sitting in the bleachers yesterday drunk off my ass looking at cute girls in skimpy Red Sox clothing the ONLY reason to have a girlfriend......  Shaq to the Heat?  That's OK, ain't like the Celtics are going to win the division for the next 10 years, anyways.  A show at the Cantab Lounge today on 738 Mass Ave near Central Sq on the Red Line.  It's a sports show, check it out.  More info: http://www.dvdemons.com
Hey folks, sorry I haven't been posting for a while, but it's been a busy week for me with the July 4th holiday, a great end to the fiscal year at my job (which came with a nice bonus at around 4 figures), fishing in Falmouth, playing poker, and of course, the drunken 6 day therapy binge I have gone through with the Red Sox over the last week.  I haven't wrote anything basically because I was physically zapped by watching all 6 of these last games versus Atlanta and New York.  If it wasn't for Curt Schilling, I would probably done a Charles Stewart and jumped into the Charles River right now.  That's how frustrating it is, and it's only the beginning of July.  As many in the nation (including the Reverend Tim about to hang himself) have witnessed over this past horrible week, one has to conclude and ask:  Do the Red Sox actually have a chance to be, agasp, competitve this year?  They're now 3 games over the Devil Rays (I can't believe I just wrote that) and pretty much heading into a (they have to at least win 4 out of the next 6) big homestand versus AL West and Wild Card contenders Texas and Oakland.  They are currently 9 games behind the NY Yankees, and unless a collapse by NY happens in the last 81 games (which could happen, as bad as the Sox are playing now, NY has serious issues with it's starting pitching and just got over a sweep by the rival NY Mets), the Sox will have to be thinking Wild Card....again.  wITH THE STRUGGLES AND STEADY DECLINE, HOWEVER, ONE NOW HAS TO CONSIDER - DO WE BECOME SELLERS AT THE TRADING DEALINE?  a) Nomar sitting on the bench during the 13 inning debacle still gives me fits (and for once, you could argue that Nomar should have stuck it out for at least one inning so Crespo should have been in the game over Millar in rightfield, so that Cairo ball doesn't turn into a double).  Nomar is also not the .330/30/110 guy he used to be.  And he's a free agent who's already rejected a 4 YEAR 60 MILLION dollar deal (wha?).   He's going to the Dogdgers....so why not get Cesar Izturis and Odalis Perez in return?  b) Derek Lowe pretty much psyched himself out of any type of talent since rejecting his 3 year, 27 million dollar deal and putting tons of pressure on himself to pitch well in his contract year.  Oh well, Derek; have fun going out in the free market: 'Will Walk for Free Food'.  Too bad he's pitching so bad they are talking about putting him BACK in the bullpen.  He needs a psychiatrist like I need to get laid.  c) And Kevin Millar, who suprises me every time he's on the field, because his career died about a year ago after hitting .220 in the last half of 2003.  He just dyed his hair blond too.  Hey Kevin....BOY BAND UP!    Plus, why is HE the KFC spokeperson?  He sucks!  People will REJECT KFC now that he's promoting it. I think Pokey Reese would be a much better choice.  SO, if this team doesn't get on a streak, and soon, these guys will be the first to go.  And I think a deal should be made reguardless because this team needs a change.  It's too comfortable.  And too poisitive, thanks to 'I won't sacrifice' Zen Master and Moby look-alike Terry Francona.  Thanks to the Moneyball/Murphy's law 'defensive errors happen' theory, the Red Sox now make more errors than the Bush Administration.  Terry's a nice guy, but he's not a good manager.  Aargh!!!!  I told everyone they should have hired Bobby Valentine!  They're are some good things about this year that make you still have hope.  There are the Sox All Stars in Schilling, Ortiz, and Manny.  And Pedro has been real optimistic in his quotes over the last few days.  When things usually went this bad in the past, he usually uses the 'my 5th grandmother got sick' excuse and goes into seclusion into the Dominican Republic for 7 days.    And they are always the Patriots.  One movie that made me feel good about all of this that I saw today was, 'Major League'.  You take away a few things from the movie: like the fact that Cleveland sucks, Charlie Sheen is a great method pitcher, the mystery of Corbin Bernsen's career, and that Pedro Serrano, despite hot being able to hit a curveball and worshipping the peagan god, Jobu, will still eventually become the President of the United States someday.    The main goal of the movie, though, is that it basically reminds fans that if you keep the faith, you'll eventually get a winner.  I say to Sox fans, just look at the bright side in that they are still 81 games left this year, and thank god for the Wild Card and 4th place!    As Jack Byrne says in the movie, 'We're somehow still in this thing'.
Here are some news and notes in the world o' sports:   Out of Red Sox injury report : Reports  urlLink have claimed that reliever Scott Williamson's right forearm  has swelled to twice the size of a normal forearm. Why is this a problem? After all, it never seemed to keep Popeye out of the bullpen; just give him less spinach, he'll be fine.   Notes from last night :   urlLink Tampa Bay left fielder Robert Fick's  last name means 'fuck' in German. That gives him the most obscene name in the majors since the retirement of   urlLink Rusty Kuntz (not making this up)  .   Soccer : The French National Soccer team has recently named Richard Fucka to their Olympic squad.   Dick Fucka will be a key role player off the bench, as he will provide distraction in laughter from the other team everytime he turns his back.   Football News :  Since retiring because he failed a pot test, Ricky Williams is now in the process of chasing a film career.  Since he, and follow running back and Raven's star Jamal Lewis (who's on trial for laundering money and cocaine trafficking) will have plenty of time on their hands, they are now in the process of filming the comedy,   'Ricky and Jamal Go to White Castle'.    If Jamal can get to the set, expect to see this movie in about 20 years to life.   Basketball :  Former Los Angeles Laker Rick Fox is divorcing wife Vanessa Williams (Vanessa Williams!), citing irreconicible differences and potential infidelity by Fox.  Apparently, Vanessa (Vanessa Williams!) is not quite good enough for his L.A. acting lifestyle. (Vanessa fucking Williams!) Too bad he's heading back to Boston in a trade that happened last week.   Remember Boston, Rick?  I live here now; good luck finding L.A.-quality hotties.   You'll still get laid for who you are, because most Boston women are tools, but you won't find any L.A. quality hotties.   Basketball :  Rick Fox has now reitred at the age of 35 after comedian Sean Caulfield reminded him of how much Boston is a sausage fest and why the female dating pool here mostly sucks.   Sports business :   urlLink Madden NFL 2005  for all videogame entertainment systems comes out today in select locations.  On a personal level, I am psyched because I had Terrell Owens and Corey Dillon traded to their new teams in the 2004 Madden franchises before they actually were.  By the way, I haven't had a girlfriend in over 4 years.  See bitterness above.   Olympics :  Yeah, I couldn't make any jokes about it, either.   Girls are hot, though.
So Nomar is gone as we all know, and I say, good for him, and good for the Red Sox.   He wasn't going to stay, and he was acting like a bitch the last few weeks because he wasn't getting any attention, and he wanted to be healthy for free agency.   'I called him in his hotel room just to wish him luck and thank him for all he did for the franchise,' Sox CEO Larry Lucchino said last night. 'Then I asked him, 'How's the heel?' He said, 'It's great.'' '(I said,) 'Great? How can it be great? Two days ago, you thought you were going to have to go on the DL.' He said, 'Yeah, well, it's great now.''  Sox sources even alleged that Garciaparra said that he wanted to make sure he was healthy at the end of the season, when he would have to take a  November physical  as part of the free agent process.    The Sox (and new ownership) weren't going to resign him, and were offended when he rejected a 4yr/15m dollar contract last year.  So, pressured to make a deal, Theo though we might as well get some players out of this before he leaves for free (Cabrera isn't a bad player, and that play last night wasn't his fault - that's Terry's for not telling him the correct relay position.  It's ALSO terry's fault that Pedro wasn;t in the game in the 8th inning.)  Nomar was being a cancer in the clubhouse, despite the fact the guy DOES play as hard as he can while in there (and produces with stats).  But the other players were tired with the, 'woe is me' bullshit, and Nomar was tired of the daily soap opera that is Boston Red Sox Nation.  The problem with Nomar, as we are now finding out, is intangibles.  You never know what to get with Nomar (see: sitting out 13 inning games versus Yankees this year), even though statistically (and even physical talent wise) he has the greater past.  Remember when Sox and Yankee fans used to debate whether Jeter or Nomar was better?  Well, the debate is similar to 'Who's career will be better? Michael Jackson and Prince?'    Michael Jackson, early in his career, was a young and hot talent.  A young prospect with great dancing talent from the Jackson 5, he came out solo and was winning awards.  He carried on his family's tradition.  He was the face of pop music, making millions..............  All in while Prince just kept the consistency turning out hit after hit, being original and gaining a fan base, making a movie, and maybe not outselling Jackson, but doing enough to be a force. He was making money and being a big player in music.   Then, MJ fell off the face of the earth when he became a white pedo pop queen; while Prince became a Jehovah's witness and STILL continues to make good, solid albums that quietly get the job done on the charts.  He OUTLASTED him.  As Chris Rock said, 'In the end.....dat nigga Prince won!'  Quietly, with a little flair, and consistency.......that's Derek Jeter.  Just like Prince, you know he's going to come around again and again and never disappoint, especially in the clutch.  He was never GREAT in terms of stats (or album sales or in dancing talent when comparing Prince to MJ) but you know what you're getting with him: a true leader and gamer who'll play every game with blood and sweat all while batting .310 with 15-20 HR and 80-90 RBI,  and a .400+ OBP with over 100 runs scored; and of course......banging hotter chicks (which is true in BOTH cases).  Nomar?  Once a much better player in the field and on the plate, his numbers have decreased over the years.  He can't play everyday (Orlando Cabrera, can) .  His defense isn't what it used to be.  His heel, ankle, and wrist are a concern.  A 2 time batting champ and once hitting .325 with 30/100+, now he's about as good as Jose Valentin with a little better batting average.  Oh, and his OBP STINKS (partly due to his philosophy at the plate, but every time Nomar popped up I wanted to kick MYSELF in the nuts).  I think that's why we had to give the Cubs an extra prospect.....because THEY knew what the risks where in getting this guy.  He's a head case (just look at him in the plate).  He was the most paranoid player in Boston sports history; the media gave him good press, and the fans (esp. kids) loved him, and he still thought everyone was out to get him as if he was Alex Jones at a Republican dinner.  Like Drew Bledsoe, it was time to go.  Time will tell if Nomar will take a page ad in both the Herald and Globe to at the least, thank the fans of Boston who loved him and remembered the GREAT times (1997-2000), even when frustrated (this one included).  He needed a change, and so did we.  We gave up a great shortstop, but we got depth, defense, and some intangibles back (Doug Mient....whatever his name is a good friend of David Ortiz, and is a leader.)  Only time will tell in wins and losses (and where Nomar goes next) whether how things will play out.
I have learned never to expect anything from people. They always dissapoint. Especially, I never expect anything from myself. I never accomplish when there is stress. I hate people who have expactations for me, they want so much, from so little. I'm not much of an amount for anything. I can't even accomplish the task of finding myself, let alone any thing else. Everytime I put expactations into someone I am always more than let down. People have never fulfilled anything and I dont think they ever will, when ever I think I might have found that something in that person, and I am hoping that they can live up to me, they let me down. I think they have done that so much, I can't cry anymore. I am used to the fact that people dont care enough to let me feel ok that they have let me down, they just use me and that's it. I think I have only found one person that hasnt let me down yet, and I havent talked to him enough to really see what would happen. I cant seem to find myself. I better go. Pressure calls.
Today was the first day of marching band. It was, to say the least, ok..I wish I could have slept in more, but we all cant have what we want. I need to talk to *mention random name here* I've been thinking about something...need to talk to him.. but, non the less im getting back into the swing off stuff, so I can ease back into the school year. Although it will be weird since it's the high school and all. But I'll just hang out with some people, maybe get a boi, and have fun this year. I haventha fun in such a long time. It i'll be nice to let my hair down, (both figurativly and literally). I have my friends, and Im gonna stick to them. I dont care what anybody says. They have no more the authority over me than I have over them i dont really much care if there older than me, because I just dont care. I have a solid group, and thats all I need. There supportive of me. Im gonna go. It's getting late. I'll write tomarrow.
A side note: I need a episode of Brendan Leonard.
This summer has been truley boring. I have been completley anti-social..and I think that I need that. I dont need people interfereing with there problems I have enough of my own. Then again..Since I havent really talked to anyone this summer, I have absolulty no clue what is going on in the 'social realm' nor do I care.  Marching band starts up again in 8 short days. Which will completley throw off my sleeping sense. I will have to get up at 8:00 in teh morning, and right now I am only getting up around 11:00 in the morning, and not going to bed until atleast 2:30-3:30 in the morning. I'm goingto be a complete wreck the first few days.  I havent came to any new conclusions recently. I havent anything to conclude. I have been completly honest with myself all this summer, and I have found what I was looking for. For once I have accomplished what I set for myslelf..even with time to spare. I hope everyone else has too.. because I know what it's like if you dont.  I really dont want to go into the high school..It seems like such a big step. Plus, I have gotten so used to going to the middle school that I really dont want to leave. But I guess it's a change I have to make, although its one I dont want to come to a conclusion about but I guess i have to. Dont worry.. I'll write later.
I realized something while I was reading over my post's..I actually depend on people. While I was upset with *insert unmentioned person here*, for stupid reasons now that I look back on it..I was truley afraid, that if I lost our friendship, then who would that  leave me to tell all my problems to, and to give me a hug when I need it. Nobody else really acts like that towards me. I mean yeah, i have a few other friends..but they would judge me. I guess he's just one of the people I need in my life. I was shocked when i thought about it..I thought i was this 'Miss Independant' (no pun intended) but I really am not. Im glad I realized it though, because maybe now I wont take the best thins in life for granted anymore.   I really need another episode of Brendan Leonard. . .  Well. I better get outa here..Oh, yeah..i changed my name to rotang because it sounds so much cooler..someone save me*
'I will not die for your government or saffer religion, I choose life' - Brandon Boyd  I hate the fact people try to force your beliefs on you. The whole time as a child and a teenager, your supposed to be finding your self, but what if you can't even see who you are. All my child hood I was never forced into religion by my parents, we never attended church and I had never saw a bible. My grandparents on the other hand, sent me a bible in the mail for me to read. I thought it was a pretty good story. That's all it was to me was a story. Then I was shunned from the people at school, because in 5th grade, the only thing you really know about your self is what you belive in. All I knew was that I had nothing to believe. In 7th grade, I had made a choice to myself that i would study diffrent types of religion, to make sure I was affirmend in my agnostic ways. At the same time there was need of participants in the local youth org. i went for 7 or 8 months. Comming to the soild conclusion I am agnostic. I had to go threw all of that just to reach a conclusion that I am havingto defend from people who were forced into it and had no choice! I think it's bullshit that these people can go around and say shit about my religion when they dont even have a clear mind of thir own. I am so pissed off about it....im gonna go clear my head...I get so worked up over this...someone save me..

'Moral: The pathetic thing that just gets in the way of everything.' Why people dwell on weather or not you have the 'Idealistic' morals or not...but whats the big deal. Morals are something that should be so deeply engrained into your skull that you dont even think about them. And this is only if you have any in the first place. I think our morals are just, as my father says, 'A product of your enviroment' you learn them from the people who are around you. You are never taught them.  This summer is letting me think too much. I need another episode of Brendan Leonard.   Its horrible how much people depend on other people. They act like if someone wasnt there ALL the damn time, they might go off the edge or something. I am fine by myself. Maybe it's because I never had anyone here anyways..but I dont really think that would matter. As a basic human instinct you react for yourself...by yourself.  Not have to be right there with your hand being held. I think thats something that has done almost totally away with the human race today. And thats a very sad thing.   I need to go think somemore about a few controversial topics. I will write later. I still need another episode of Brendan Leonard.  I have to go. People cant survive without me.
OMG! The game was horrible. First of all, we didnt play, second of all, the guys didnt show up. Meaning I had to brave the world and go to the game myself. O that was great fun! I came to a good conclusion though. I can't stand hanging out with the girls. They have horrible personalities. All they care bout are 4 things. Talking about each other, Clothes, boys, and gay random things. I almost went spaztic on them tonight, but saekho was there..thats not saying much, but, I didnt want them saying stuff bout her, cause she hangs with me. Evne though I already know they dig on her and shit cause of it. I gotta go, ('rents.)
I've been in a good mood for a rather suspicious amount of time now. 9 Days. Woa. Im going to the game tonight to. Because we dont have to march this one. *SCORE* I gotta hook ciara up with her guy..That will take sometime. I have nothing to write. I have no clue whats wrong with me. I'll write after the game.
I hate weekends.  I need to be around everyone again. Even though it seems like I get fed up with everyone, and irritated so easily, it's better when I dont have to think about things. There's too much happening at home. So much drama, damn communication.  I hate the way I act around people. Especially family. I still can't let them in, to really know me. I don't trust them. I couldnt change it if I wanted to tho. It's like embeded into my brian. WARNING! These are the people who 'have your back' dont let them in on anything. I hate feeling like a damn robot.  I regret acting like that. Once again, I hate the weekends. Thank you.
-Perfect- You're the perfect girlfriend. Which means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't care about presents or about going to fancy placed. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy being around your boyfriend.    urlLink   What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Interesting Eh? I thought so. No, I am not on drugs. The shades of grey have cleared my path, sunny skies to stay. I need this feeling to hold me close, to make it right.
'Please don't play with me, my paper heart will bleed' -AAR If I was a toy, I would think my wind-up key was missing. I honestly don't know what it is anymore. There's just so much, and because of that, I can't even focus on one thing. There's just too much.  I know what I want out of life, that I can't have. I think I am an Emotionally Homeless person. Im sitting on the edge of your sidewalk, and my can is out, and that's the farthest I've gotten, because I don't even have a house to call you from.  The greatest prize in life is love, but whats to do when you have no absolution of it? I couldnt belive in love. If someone paid me a million dollars, I wouldnt.  'It's a known fact, when two opposites come together, it always ends in heartache.' The sad thing is, most experiance heartache before there even together. But you couldnt tell that person, because most likley your trying to cover-up the fact you have feelings for that person. And you get upset if the person does something, or acts a certian way but they can't help it, because they have no clue as to what their doing wrong.  I wish we were all dead to the emotion of love, like robots. That would just make life easier to get thru, so of coarse that would never happen.  'Cause I'd never do something intentionally just hurt you And I've stared at the sky and I've asked myself why you've become like an angel to me'    ~Allister Pain isn't planned, because it's always there. Never goes away, Never show remorse. It's like a ugly scar from a long time ago. Even the best neosporin can't take this away. I know my ramblings don't leave you to much of a plot line, but it's 10:00 in the morning, and I just cant take much more of this.
umm... Well, to everyone who reads this damn thing, for some reason or another, I'll let you in on a little secret, today was very interesting. My bandmates and I had..'rehersal' if you want to call it that. Which was very interesting. Band sucked as usual. There's no mystery to that. The only awesome thing is, we dont have a.m. rehersal, so I get to sleep in! WOAH! Tomarrow is our first football game. And we gotta go all the way to that one place..um..Conneaut, that will be very interesting.  I really dont have anything to say. The usual people pissed me off, and thats about it. *COUGH COUGH* They know who they are. If they dont, their even bigger jackasses then I thought.   If something happens, I'll write later, if not, I'll catch you after the game.
the bus from hell. 'I hope that when you wake up, everything that you've ever wished for is dead in your arms.' I hate having competitions. I'm not that kind of girl. Especially when the prize is sumthing that I should of had from the start, but the other person is...and ruined it. *cough cough* No, I am not obvious. Im just always pissed. I rarely talk about my problems, as people now know. I never did before, why start now. In all reality, I know there might be a few people who actually care and want to know..The others jut go and form a pity crowd. But Ive already been thru that explanation.  Our bus rides are very interesting..*COUGH COUGH* Our small group.. you know what I mean. And yet again, I am the only one who didnt get anything. Tear. But thats ok. Conneaut is in 2 days. Which means a hour and a half bus ride. I know who I'm sitting with..*smile cheesy grin*  School starts in about 12 days. Thats too soon for me. I need more time to listen to my 'Fuck off because the world doesnt care on the back of the bus music.' Not really..I need someone who cares.. Later..
Misery has company.  'Today the weight of the world was on my shoulders, my life, wasnt spared. I hoped you would come, to help me out, but I found you never really cared.' 8-20-03 I hate people who make assumptions about me. Not even half of the people I hang out with really know me. They know the shaded side of me. The front that I put up. If I really acted the way I am at home, I would probably sit in the back of the class, in the corner, thinking of so much, that it means nothing at all. People see the happy side of me, and they think im depressed, I would hate to see their reaction now. (and to everyone who has read this, or is reading it now, im not a mental case. dont even think about it..) I can't help it though, I try to talk to people. They all just seem to depend on me to hear there problems, and deal with the problems for them, but if I would try to talk to someone, they would just blow me off and start on some completly random subject.  I think the problem, isn't so much a 'me' thing. Everybody else is just way to self centered, to give a damn about how I feel. And if I would be sad, or angry, it's not like I could tell anyone, because I can tell that most of it, is just out of pity. I wont stoop down to that level.  On the brighter side of the rainbow.. Tonight is our first preformance, woo..(in sarcastic voice...) I really dont want to go. I just want to sleep. I mean, we march pretty good, and sound pretty good..It's just that, this means I have to see everybody,  and cover my front up again. And I am not in the mood for that. I rather slip into my emo mood and sit in the dark, while playing some music, and think more about  why I am like I am. But thats just me. I might go and try out for 'Romeo and Juliet.' KSU is doing a production, and they need a 14 yr. old. right up my ally. Plus I already have more than half memorized, so it wouldnt be too hard.  I dread the day that school starts. UGH! I'll probably end up spazing out on someone, or freaking out, and that's never too pretty. I hope I dont. But hey, im unpredictable.  After dad leaves, I think im going to go and rest. I need some sleep. I need to think and relax. This day sucks. I'll write tonight when I get home. Someone save me.
Things are known.  Everyone is catching on to me. I have people, left, and right asking me about it. I didnt know I was like a book. I dont think im so confused now. I kinda thought things thru a little bit last night, and today. Now it's just a race against time. I can't believe her. Being so selfish like that. I should have knew it would end up this way. She'll try and beat me to the punch, I know it. So, now, I am forced into making a decision I really dont want to make. About being inqusitive or not. (you get the point.) The thing is, I dont want this to turn out like another version of No Doubt. That would just suck. I know 'other people' dont want me to, for the sake of us all, but my feelings are telling me diffrent. But sometimes there blind. I dont want to just let this sit back and take it's coarse. I am afriad of the outcome.  I need to go and stratagise. Before it's too late, and the whole situation becomes 'The one that got away'
Today was a torment, of my own hell. I havent been this confused, for over a year now. and just when I think that things are beginning to look up for me..BAM! things just hit me like a train, and I dont know what to do.. I cant just tell people my confusion, first of all, they most likley dont care and just want some dirt to burn me with later, and if they do care, they have no clue of what to say, or do to help me, which to me is absolutly pointless. So I have to sit here completly alone, and try and console myself through this, before someone makes a move. I dont want anyone to make a move..I dont want to have to regret any of my actions. I dont want to be forced into a decision I dont think I can full heartily make. Especially because I know how it feels and I dont want to be the reason for another broken heart.  I dont think I could put either one of them through that. Plus there best Friends. Now, how am I supposed to deal with that. If I would do anything with one, they would probably just turn around and go tell the other, and vice versa. And I know that that feels like an extreme kick to the chest. I wish that this would all go away. I even felt like going away to some far off place and putting thisall behind me, that way they would both come out even. Because neither one of them is better than the other.  I cant keep this all in my head though..I might just go completly insane and up a wall if I would. And for fear of someone involved in this, reading this, and getting more info then what I need for them to have, I cant write anything that they can take out of context. So to save myself from more of a head ache, and more pain..Im going to stop here..and if I can I'll write later.  pain is inevitalbe, misery is optional...enjoy the ride.
Well, band camp was last week. As I like to call it, Hell Week. School is in 16 days, and counting. I really dont want to go. It'll be cool to be with all the guys again and stuff, but I dont want to deal with the other people. That IS going to suck.   I am really really really confused again..Thats half the reason I spazed out at band camp. I havent told anybody why yet..and I dont think Im going to. It's not the kinda thing I can just come out and tell people. Plus, it was more than just what was going thru my head. It was people pissing me off, and not caring about it. I really hope no body finds that hole in the wall that I punched... The horrible thing is, I cant even tell the guys what happened, because that would put them in such a awkward postion, and there too good of friends to do that too.   One a brighter note.. I learned tat I can unwrap a starburst in my mouth and a piece of Orbit gum. Im still working on a hershey kiss, but I know Ill be able to do that too.   I dont want to go back to band tomarrow. I only had 2 days off. Thats not enough! I need a week to recoupe. Im still kinda sick and tired from the food up in Edinboro. Damn Pizza. I dont want this school year to end. The sooner it does, the sooner I have to loose all my friends to the real world. That will just fucking suck. I better be going. I have to find out whats all going down tomarrow. Guys never tell me anything. Later.
Well. I guess I am not so confused...and not so sad. Which is a good thing, because Im going into my second week, and we have band camp in exactly 7 days. That really sucks. That also means school is right around the corner. And personally I dont want to technically 'go' into the high school. I just want to move into the grade ahed of me. My grade is just SO boring, conforming, and just like everyone else. Which is horrible in my point of view. LALALALALALA...LMAO!.. I gotta go because I have absolulty nothing to talk about and people I actually do talk to online, might be getting on shortly, or else I will have to be getting off very shortly! Either way it works..shortly!!
Well, Its after the first week, and IM SO CONFUSED!!!! I like all the music were playing, it's really easy. And our band has been doing good. We kinda made our first song, called 'Huh?' it's sweet, but we kinda wrote it in about 15 mins. We need the melody and the ska breaks now. The best song, is 'Surf Wax America' by weezer. That song owns. Im horrible confused. I need still need to talk to some one.. or i might possbly go insane.  I havent seen The Brendan Leonard Show in about a week or so now. I miss it.. but I have alot of...other....things to worry about. Corey better not be acting like a jerk. He only has came to 1/2 of the practices. We need to get Dan in the band. that way someone would actually be there to play.  I cant wait for band camp...I really need to get a NEW BATHING SUIT!! Teh other one, is too, not there. And the guys will be there. Well I have to go.. I have to come up with dinner plans.

Thank you for visting 2003, cuz 2004 herre I come!! This year's gonna be great. I know it. I can feel it. Good things are going to be comming. And its about damn time! Too many horrible things have happened to me this year. Too many to count on my fingers and toes.  Wow, im on the phone with Sarah. Were confirming our evil plans for tonight. Which include movies, pizza, watching 4 little girls, and acting like complete morons!! YeS! Thats what we defintily do best. I must say. I wonder what the guys are doing for New Years?? Oh, well. I really dont care anymore. They dont give a fuck about me, or whats going on, so why should I care about them. I take that back. One cares. Thats it. And who that is, you know who you are. and it's defintly not the obvious. Dude, the Alice 19th manga is totally awesome! I love that one. dothack was pretty good, but I seem to like Alice 19th and Love Hina more. My Aunt, Uncle, and cousin are uptown from Columbus. Thats cool. My Aunt is awesome to hang out with. My cousin is 11 and he's at the stage where he thinks he knows everything that is going on and how to do everything. And he has no fucking clue. It's hilarious, yet agrivating at the same time. I know, I know I went thru the same thing..but I wasnt obvious about any of it. Well Im gonna skidattle, haha, I cant wait to party. Im gonna go pick something out to wear, and get a tshirt for Sarah. If anyone cares have a great NY!!

'I feel diseased Is there no sympathy, for the sun  The sky's still fire But I am safe in here, from the world outside So tell me What's the price to pay for glory' - Finch  Hate. I think Hate is a strong enough word. But maybe it's not.  I hate him. That's all there is to it. I can't stand to think about him, I can't stand to look at him, I can't even stand to say his name. So I'm not. He acts like he's my best friend, he acts like he doesnt know me. His a double-eged sword, and I sometimes wish that I never became friends...with him. But enough with that. I need some movie ideas. I gots my camcorder for xmas this year, and all the editing equipment to go along. I need to write scripts, and have willing-non-paid actors to come and be in my movies.  I get to go back to school on Monday. Not today. Next monday. Oh, joy. (sarcasim) I really dont want to go back, because that means I have to see certain people. But on the other hand I will get to see the gorgeous Jon, (see previous entry.) *smile.*  'There I am standing all alone on the Sydney Harbor Brige. And you know I would jump into the fucking ocean if it meant I was truly capable of being satisfyed. Will I ever be? Did I just give up the best thing I ever had?' The Ataris.   My head hurts, my stomach hurts, and Im getting hungry. You might think this all seems like it's too much. Because it is.
Now I find out how much people really care. I've noticed that when you have to see a person repedtly, it's hard to get away from that person. It's like your addicted to them. But when your givin an oppertunity to 'escape' from them for a while, people eat it right up!  Finchaholic. Atariholic. Incuaholic. I'm a very 'holic' person. I absoultly love the song 'What it's like to burn,' by Finch. It's amazing. The construction, Lyrics, Emotion, it's all amazing. I think I've been listing to it for 2 days straight. I've also been consumed by 'Megalomanic' from Incubus. It's off of their new CD thats not out yet. Also, its like there old stuff, like a mix of Science, and Make Yourself.   I hope theres no snow on the ground for xmas. That way everyone is upset and it creates major chaos. Haha. What I wouldnt give to be able to make something go wrong.   I feel bad for the Fall From Betweeners. They didnt win battle of the bands last night at peabodys. I think their egos are damaged a little. Im still planning on seeing them for New Years Eve. I want to get a picture with the group and with the almighty Jon. He's a gorgeous man. It's one of the situations, where you can look but you cant touch, not only because he's taken, but because he wouldnt spend a second of his time with the likes of me.  Belive me, I do look.  Oh well. Im on my search for something, even though the lack for motivation, isnt any help. I guess eventually someone will show up for me. Eventually isnt soon enough.  I wish I had the power to take everything back, the right and the wrong decisions that Ive made, and make it all diffrent. I dunno. I want to move and become unknown. Im gonna go. Gotta go wrapup the fucking holidae shopping.
'Think of today as a much-deserved day of rest, dear Libra. You are usually the one people turn to when they need comfort and consolation. Today, however, in spite of the tension that's in the air, your words seem to have no effect. Good! Let other people take care of themselves for a change.'  Words need no guidence. Actions do. So misconcepted. People never get what im trying to get across. They take it out of context and blow it out of proportion. I can't make a friendly gesture, with out someone taking it wrong.  Where's Brendan Leonard? ---> This was my favorite show over the summer, and it's gone! I havent seen it in months. Maybe someone thefted ABCfamily of the tapes. I think I need to place a call to the russian mafia.  Wow. It's 11:57, as I type. That means only 2 days until I can open up my x-mas presents. (Note: At the household, we open gifts on x-mas eve. Just for the simple fact were too lazy to wake up early on x-mas day, and I dont feel like waiting that long.)  No one showed up today. I tried calling but his line was busy. I think he doesnt want anything to do with me anymore. It's awefully funny (sarcasim) how they ditched us Friday, and how we havent gone anyplace just the normal 3 of us in a few weeks. I have a feeling something's up. Not like I could approch him about it though. Oh yeah I could see it now. Me: How come we never do anything anymore? Him: What do you mean? Me: Well we used to go places, walk alot and talk on the phone. We dont do any of that anymore. Him: Meh, dunno. Why do you care so much? Me: Because I still like you alot. Even though you used me, and ect..yeah. Him: WAAAH!?!? ---That would go over oh-so-smoothly. I need to move on to somebody else. Somebody better, who shows more respect, and who dosent want me to be something im not. But I have no clue who that is. Oh, well I guess Im not the like-able type because no one likes me like that. I made cookies today. Peanut Butter ones. The 'rents liked them. But I got sick both times after eating them. I think im allergic to Peanut Butter. That would suck. Oh, deary me. It's 12:08. and I gots some stuff to get yet. If I can I will write later. If not then I will tomarrow sometime. *Someone Save me.*
Bright morning. Dim mind. I hate getting up this early on weekends. It's 9:31, and for all of you without an Ohio residence its bright, cold, and windy outside. Not too pleasent.  It is amazing to think that only 5 months ago I was laying around with friends complaining about being too hot, and thinking that I was going to die of heat damage. But I guess that just goes on to prove that time is going by so quickly we dont fully have a concept of it. I think everyones comming over today. It'll be entertaining.  I hate Christmas. I hate the corny, over the top, extent that people go thru to make it 'special' yeah, it's special enough to puke over. If I was in charge of a household, I probably wouldnt even decorate. I see no sense in putting out all of this stuff, like statues, trees, tinsel, ect.. for a month out of the year, and then packing it all up so you can put yourself thru it again next year. I also hate the family get-to-gethers. Actually, I just hate family. They make to big of a deal about 'how I've turned out.' I think I turned out just fine thank you. I dont steal, I dont do drugs, I do really good in school, and I have alot of good friends. In my book that makes a pretty good person. Im still sick if anybody was wondering. If anyone cares.  I dont think anybody cares about me. They care about using me. They care about having someone to take their anger out on, or to get money off of. But once again, Im almost to the point where I absolutly dont care anymore...Im gonna go think about some stuff. I'll write later.

'I just found a friend in one of your lies, to treat me so nice, I can't belive my bones.'  - Ever So Sweet. The early November.  That's right folks, it's Christmas Vacation. A time of Boredom, Insomnia, Fights, and tears. I can't wait!  I know, I know..I do need this break. I need it to take time from everyone who's been driving me up the wall the past 5 months. I dont think I have anymore wall to go up with out reaching the ceiling. New Years Eve will be fun though. Sarah and I are going to go to the Section 8 show to go and see Fall From Between. Fall From Between hit Brookfield like a new boy band hits TRL. All of a sudden everyone was a emo indie kid! How amazing! Now, dont take this the wrong way, they are a pretty jazzy get together, but when everyone and there grandma are so emo-licious it gets kind of overrated.  I want to go back to New York City. That was ah-mazing. The people, the sights, it makes me feel all stuffed up and cloggy inside! Or maybe thats because I got sick again from it. Tonsilitius, Pink Eye, Ear Infecton, oh yeah i got it all. If anyone wants to be sick and miss some school, call me. I wish I had someone I could talk to. Someone I could spill my heart out to, and they would listen. I dont have anyone like that. No one will listen to me. There too self absorbed to give a damn about me. It really makes me angry, but theres nothing I can do about it. Im not a mean person. As much as everyone tells me that I dont 'have' to be nice to people I just can't help it. And with that, people just walk all over me and use me as a welcome mat for there problems. Maybe thats what I can attempt to change over break. Im not going to be so willing to listen. Maybe then they will all get the hint. Just maybe. Oh well. It's not like I have a choice. I just dont care anymore.
A void.  Things have been moving to fast to attempt to type it all. So I guess to avoid that, I will continue from now.  Situations have come and gone, but I've kept my cool and stayed the same. Bonds have broken, been fixed and broken again. But we're on a road of empires and things like that just take it's tole. Things have happened in my life these past 3 months that will mean more to me than I ever know now. Grandma dying, Break-Ups, Make-Ups and Shake ups, and I realized that some friendships are no longer there. But I guess this is just the cycle that I fell into, and not by option.  I have also been trying to figure out what people dont like about me. I've asked my camarades what they think. But they havent been able to come up with anything.  I know Im not a perfect sociable being. Something must be wrong. Im also in search of something. Something I honestly dont think Ill be able to find. I still have attachments to a certian person, and I have been trying to keep it a secret, but people are catching on. If they catch on to anything, its not Algebra, or Science, but who you have feelings for. I can't help it. I dont know what it is. I've tried everything. Like having feelings for someone new, thinking about all of these horible things they never even did, and such..but it doesnt work! It makes me so aggravated. Especially when you tell someone who you think you can trust, and it turns out to be someone who can't keep there mouth shut. Not mentioing any names or anything.  But with all of this I've decided to use the energy for a greater good. Like studying and reading Manga. Yes, you read correctly..m-a-n-g-a. That thing also known as anime. Its awesome, Im reading Love Hina, and .Hack\\Legend of the Twilight. Well, its Harry's Love Hina, but the other one is mine. Things are definitly changing and I have no clue about what to do. Im out for now. But I'll prolly write later.  ~Me.
Hey all.  Life is a jewish bastard. I dont care anymore. I hope you dont either. Hope is a waste. Emotion is rough.  Can you say, Ive had enough?
Sorry Im the person I am. If I could I wouldnt be me. Too Bad. Already am.  I went over to Harry's today. Then we went sledding for quiet awhile. We ran into Tom and Scott, and went sledding with them. Then we got cold and hungry and decided to head back. Then we goofed off for a while and ate some dinner.  I realized what I needed to along time ago.  Why am I the way I am? Why do I have to be the one stuck so depressed all the time, and why do I have to be the odd one out by the whole vegetarian scheme? If I was normal like every other ska-bunctious kid then maybe I wouldnt be such a problem. Thats all I am. A problem. While im deep in thought, im going to go listen to some Early November, and think about some stuff.  Nights are too long. Hope will never come.
well. its been a few days. but ive been busy. as always. spent the weekend with my aunt in hubbard. its cold as a mother outside. I havent been in much of a mood lately. I guess that comes from thinking too much.  Loneliness is a state of mind, not a state of being. :: jaTR 3:07  ::   Wow. Isnt that a true mission statement of life.  I think later, like around noon, im going to place a call to the guys and see if they want to do anything. Im thinking sno-boarding. but its fucking-cold-ass outside and I dont know if I want to brave the weather.  Yeah, im still sick. But i dont think they know whats wrong with me. Sometimes when I eat, well after I eat, I get really cold, and really sick to my stomach all at the same time. Then I get really dizzy, almost blacked out. I dont think thats good. but thats between me and you. Im almost done reading the first vol. of  Ceres  it's pretty good. then again I like alot of Yu Watatse's works. So there you go. I know this is short, but I gotta go. Im getting really sick again, because I ate a pop-tart. I'll blog later. Maybe when the guys are here.
Today wasnt any better. What a surprise. Mid-terms are over. I can have my brain back. Single sentance. Double sentance. Bored as hell. Always am. Depressed as a mother. Always that to.  You might think that because im cheerful in school. Im cheerful all the time.  You thought wrong. I can be deciving. Three months untill permit time, and 8 months and three days untill freedom. Forever until I get a life, and make things right. but whats new. Im gonna go, because no body cares. Well a few people might.  And, that's another story kids.
Yeah I get it. Nobody fucking cares.   People act like im stupid and cant see thru what their doing. But to reassure those certain folks, I can. The outside shades the depths of reality.  Wow. I love this song. I've had it stuck in my head for the past week.  'It's my life,' No Doubt. I kno I kno. Kinda corny, but it has a cool guitar part, and the pedals are awesome. I want a pedal. I want a life. I want some chinese food. There you have it. Three more things. Have fun. -It used to all be fun and games, until things changed. Like Ive said. I dont like change. I dont like snow. Or the artic.  I want to be a pirate.  Im sick. I think. Ive had random dizzy, nausea and tiredness spells. I dont think thats a completly normal thing. I cant tell the parents. I just got over having the flu, tonsilitus, Bronchitus and almost namonia. (_ Im not a very needy person. I only want a few things. But I cant get those. I guess I either dont have any luck. Or no one gives a fuck about me. Im thinking its a combination of both.  Im going to go before I depress all of you too much. I wouldnt want it to wear off.  I dont care anymore. cuz nobody ever did.
Forget me. It's that simple.   You say hate is such a strong word. And yet. I use it most often.  Coming from an agnostic person, I hope you should take my theory to heart. As Ive seen more sorrow than you religious pukes will ever. I see the normal human being. They belive what they've been taught from the start of their time. God Created them. And things are fine..as long as you have absolution. Others, who are agnostic, were (most likley) not grown up on religion. We just know that we are here, and we can do what we want with it. And thats life.  Well, sitting there the other day, I realized how sad I was, and all the while I was thinking, 'I bet the kid who prays before bed, has never been as down as this, and I bet he will never know what the end is like before it actually happens.' Then I put into my mind the prospective that if there was a lord that heals the wounded and aids the sorrow of the world, that wouldnt this be a fitting punishment for all the disbelivers?  If I were god, I would think so.  Im not saying the whole ordeal made me into a beliver, because it didnt. But it made me think. It's still making me think.  I hate thinking.   'Its funny how I found myself, and realized how I was played upon, from your game, but its MY life, dont you forget..'
Well  I  was  going to update yesterday, but I didnt get online untill 12:30 a.m. and by that time, I was wayyy t tired.  The guys came over yesterday, Dan, Harry, and Joe. It was fun. We tryed to figure out songs for our band..that never goes well. I think we have one song on the list, good job kids. Then we decided to act like moe-rons, and try snowboarding, even though we have no snow only mud. Then we played twister for like 3 hrs. omfg my knee hurts like a damn mofo!  It's so cold outside. I hate the cold. I hate hamburgers. I hate peppers. Yeah, now what.  I dont want to go back to school tomarrow. Nope I dont. I like the weekends. Sleep. Food. Music. How much more fun could it get. Besides not having to do fucking mid-term reviews that the bitchass teachers give us.  The parentals are bugging me about college already. They wanna know what im gonna major in, what school I wanna go to, tuiton costs...I have no clue. I want to go somewhere in New York City, Like NYU. I want to do advertising layouts for people, like musicians. That way I get to meet awesome people, and yet I get paid good money. What more could you want? I wish I lived in Cocoa Beach. That way I could surf all the time, and be really good at it. And it would rarely ever get tooooo cooold. Oh well. Not like anyone is reading this besides you. Not like anyone cares. But oh well. I dont care anymore.
This week has gone by really slow. But today and tomarrow should be a boat load of fun! Were all going to go get some chineese, around 4:00.  All include: Dan, Harry, Pat, Bob, Jeanette, myself, and I think thats it. Then Harry, Dan, Joe are all comming over tomarrow. I think Rob is comming later. Oh well gotta go plead with mom.  --Later-- Alright. It's 9:15. Serious update time. Let's rock da socks off! Well chineese was fun. Though, Pat and Jeanette didn't show. I forgot Jen was grounded and that Pat dosent do anything without his better half. Oops. So it was just me, dan, harry, and bob. O yea. Harry's gma was there too.  I miss having our group together. Just the 4 of us. It hasnt been that way in a while. So, I guess things are just changing. Have I ever told you I dont like change? I dont like change. Gots a new sn. I didnt like the xsurfpunk07 thing. Kinda gay. Oh, well. Im gonna go. I gotta get an icon. Plus, I cant type 'hard' the mother is sleeping. and drama calls. Like ive said before. Ppl cant live without me.
'i wanna stay 18 forever so we can stay like this forever and we'll never miss a party cuz we keep them going constantly and we never have to listen to anyone about anything cuz its all been done and its all been said we're the coolest kids and we take what we can get' - - Brand New 'Soco Ameretto Lime' Jonsessive Axeulsive. It's a new disease. Catch it soon.  Today was very eventfull, stressful and full of self-realization! I hate it.  I dont know why I do the things I do, like keep this blog, write in a journal, talk the way I talk, dress the way I do, act the way I do. I have no clue. There's so many things about myself that I want to change, that I cant. I want to be thinner, I want to be taller, I want to be nicer. There's so many things. Belive it or not, there's so many things that you can come up with while writing a french paper. I came with a new slanguage. Oh well. I'll write it later. My head hurts. I dont feel good. And Im the biggest nerd you ever knew.   But as McCabe said. Im a princess. But thats Princess Taltua to you!
I got mad love for Pippen.  That movie was ah-mazing. I don't think anyone could really expect a better production themselves..except maybe Tolkin himself.  Well, today was the first day back to school. After a very long two weeks. Things, were in better condition than I expected them to be. Harry talked to me like nothing was wrong. I was completly shocked. I thought he hated me. I bet Rachel said something. She always does.  I think i'm gonna buy a few packages of twizzlers, just to attack Bob with. And yes, I still have welts on my arms. I bet Dan does too. Wow, Corey came back. It's been forever and 3ft since I've seen him. I swear to you he has grown like 3ft. Hes almost as tall as me! Thats really ah-mazing. I don't want to go back to school tomarrow. I think I'm getting sick again. I just got over being sick!! I have a theory that I need my tonsils removed. I dont want to have my tonsils removed. That scares me. . . wow. something scares me.  Theres a certan extent that you can talk to a family member, without them becoming extremly annoying, or to a pont that they know way to much about you to ignore them. because that folks is were a little thing called BlackMail comes in. And thats NOT COOL.  I need to find the Alice 19th mangas. Waldens didnt have them, but they did have .hack\\ and I'm reading that, but I like Alice 19th better.  So many social issues. So much drama. But what else is High School about?  The worlds resting on my shoulders, and no ones here to help.   urlLink    You are  Kusakabe Marron | Kaito Jeanne  You are generous and talented, though often widthdrawn.

Alright. Don't scurry, this wont take long. I dont think I need away messages. Everytime I put up and away message, something important is asked, or happened. And by the time I check those messages, they're signed off. WTF! Yesterday, Bob wanted to get some people together and go to the movies. I have been wanting to do that for SOO long! But because my away was up, I didnt get the message, and he signed off. That fucking sucks. Then, what happens, is if I dont put up my away message, then no one will message me and I am stuck browsing the net untill I have seen everything. And people told me that it was impossible! Umph! I watched a movie yesterday. Called 'The St. Francisville Experiment.' It was actually really kinda cool, untill the last 10 mins. when things got totally unbelieveable. Like a ghost cutting this fucking annoying psychic up, and she just stood there like a moron, screaming, covered in blood. Or, Tim. My, my, my. I was disapointed in Tim. He was so awesome, and became my favorite, and he had the cheesiest ending. The Blair Witch kind of thing. Ryan (a girl) was really lame too. She was the most terrifyed, and also had one of the cheesiest endings. Her table started shaking, and she fell thru the floor. They all ended up in some tourcher chamber that was secretly hidden thru a closet in the house. (tim found it first) They did have some good aspects, like the chair, (hey kids, that one worked.) And the little things. But WTF! Havent you ever seen a scurry movie before!?! Alright. I get frustrated when filmaking goes wry.  Well, today Aunt Kathy and I are going to go see 'The Return of the King.' Were gonna go to the 4:00 showing. So, we problably wont get back until 8 or so. Yayy! Then I have school tomarrow. I dont wanna go!! I do, so I can get out of the house, but I dont because I dont want to have to but up with all the hysterics that are going to becoming from everyone. Oh, and I am going to re-dye my hair tonight. The red is really fading, so I got a new bottle last night. wOOt! Ok. Im out like a light. Write later. Promise.

Friends can surprise you. You can be surprised. Everything was fun. The Band. The really crappy-gay 80's board games. Sitting at the end of her driveway at 1 a.m. The deep convos. Cold Pizza. Sparklers. 'Coke-a-Cola.' Yelling out the window like a retard at Ryan, Jon and T.J. Barb-b-cue Chips.  I thought. 'Hey dummy, it's new years. I need resolutions. Cool resolutions.' So, I thought what better place to put them but my blog-of-fame. Or, blog-of-shame. 1.) Forget about any feelings I have previously felt for *shall remain silent*  2.) Become a in-cogneto-super-hero. (anime-style. ah-hahaha.) With select powers I will list after..*grin*  3.) Become more self-confident.  4.) Loose (atleast) 10 lbs. (I kno, I had to throw it in!!)  Thats about it. I only want to make those I think I can accomplish! And I think those are pretty good. Ok. Now I'll elaborate on the super-powers. The power to fly. ( a must!) Ablity to teleport! (totally awesome) MindReading. (another must) Immortality. (^^) The power to make guys fall in love. Any guy. *wink* I think thats about all for right now. I'll for surley come up with some more later on. I'll update again then too. Ugh! School starts again in 4 days. That is Monday. Too soon. I don't want to deal with *HIS* bitchass and the problems that risen over break. Oh, well. I guess I'll say enough is enough cuz it's not comming back from him. I can't win. I need to stop expecting change.
-Song- 'Hands Down' Dashboard Confessional -Mood- Blah.  Yeah, I'm not angry anymore. Well not enough to mean anything to you anyways. After I posted earlier, I went for a very looong walk. For like 2 hours I was gone. I was down in the bottom, in the woods..haha I was running from the people on the quads! It was crazy-hu-ha-hu-hu-ha! I hate the way I am. I hate being so funny, and so loud. I hate it. I wish I was more quiet and serious about alot of stuff. I wish I was more studious. People can't take me seriously. I can't take my self seriously. Maybe that's the reason I can never get a boyfriend. They have infurity complexes when Im around, because Im so loud. Guys always have to be the center of attention.  I dont know what I could do to change that though. I mean I can't just change in a snap. Things take time. I never seem to have anytime. I hate this shiz. -*argh*- Oh well.  I think Im going to go on a scary movie marathon! I need one! I love those movies.  Oh, snap jesus, that kid has kicks. I need to read more some more of Edgar Allen Poe. He was such a genious for his time. He creates such atmosphere, and dramatities with words. 'The Cask of Amantillado.' Its very good. You can learn a thing or two about revenge in that short story. 0o; Well ima go. I need something. I dont know what yet. If you kno, let me know. I'll love you 4-lyfe!! Okay. Nevermind I've got something else to complain about.  I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. I hate people. Yes, That's right folks. I do. I dont care anymore. I am going to go far away. Maybe Cocoa Beach. That way I can live on the beach, surf, and go to school, where the people dont know me and everything would be all fine an dandy. I can't wait until I drive. I can just get up and go. I dont care, and I doubt you do.  Oh, snap jesus, that kid gots kicks!!
Hello fellow readers. This is time for another instal-ment of things that make Heather mad, and what she hates. -ding!- Okay. First of all. Alot of things have been making me mad. Dont ask me why, because I am normally a very not-mad person. Argh. Like, I can't stand it when people ask me a million bizgillion questions on the saaame topic I mind you, that I told them from the get go I dont know much about. Okay, the second thing that makes me angry is when people say that there going to do something, and they dont. When they completly blow the person off. That is really horrible. I can't stand that for the life of me. Third of all. It's really nice outside, but do you think I have anyone to go walking with, or go do something with? No. No. No. I am such a loser, that I have to spend it all inside on the computer typing in this damn blogger because no one ever wants to do anything. Ugh!  *phew* Now, onto what I hate.  I hate alot of things latley. I dont normally hate anyone/anything. I dont know whats wrong with me. Im not going to go into an extreme amount of detail, but yeah. It makes me soo aggravated because I cant say what I want to say. I always feel like Im saying something stupid. Or that something isnt right. People have that affect on me. I hate my four wheeler, because I accidently blew out one of the tires last winter, and I havent been able to ride for like 3 months now. Riding was defnintly one of my 'ska' things. That makes me so mad. I dont know what to do. But dont worry about me. Because no one ever has, and no one ever will. BaH! Im going to go before I get really mad.  Some one Save me. I will love you forever if you do!
Yeah. Nothing has really happened since I last updated, but Im horribly bored and not tired, so I fiured that I would type more of my ever-so-tragic-drama-less-life, in hizzle.  Well, tommarow ima spend the night over Sarah's house, that way we can hang, and do the little secret mission. haha yayyyy. fun fun.  I didnt get to el talko (L - TACO) tonight. Im mad.  hahaha not really. I feel soo ADD. I really thing her case is wearing off on me. thats not cool man. Oh Yeah! (kool aid guy voice)  Im soo bored! And tired. NOT a good combo. lmao. Ima gooo befooore i gets tooo off the wall. yup. Save Me Before I Go Insane. And ill love you for life.
I thought I had everything figured out.   Yeah, go figure. Let's see. At the beginning of last week, things were good. They were actually more than good they were great.  cue *happy ska, happy ska* Than things started to turn around in simple directions. And I got lost. Did I mention I am  still  lost? Eyah.  Things suck. Charades in band was a riot tho! And for the record. My happy streak was only 10 days. Ahem.  'Anthem of our dying day,' is an awesome song. I suggest all of you go out to your pc and download it. Yes. That's right.. ^^It's by Story of the Year,  if any of you were actually going to dl it. Im going to go. My head is a mess. Blah. I need someone to talk to, and a drummer. That stuff makes it possible. Holy cruton of Christ. Someone save me..I'll love you forever if you can.
Mmmkay. It's been a few days. But my brain has been pulling a double-over time.  I need some pink lemonade.  That stuff makes it possible.  Well. My good mood, has lasted for the longest I think a good mood has ever lasted. Oh, wait. It hasn't lasted 11 days yet. *cough* Yeah. And I actually found a ska band that I can stand longer than I work out. There called 'Madness.' Well, I only hurd one song, so I dont know if I could stand them for that long, but..eyeah. I need to find a new drummer. The ska band needs one. If anyone is a drummer, and good, IM me @ xsurfpunk07 or sign the board with your info. If you do, I will have mad love for you for life and go out on a date with you (^_^)   I seriously need a life I swear. All I do is sit at home on the computer, or reading.  If anyone would like to come save me sometime, be happy to stop on over. I need some company.  Okay, I lied that good mood is kinda going away. Don't ask me why. I dont feel like going into specifics. I just need a few ears to talk it out with. Yeah. (I'll translate the Heather language into normalcey for some of you..) That means I wont talk about it because .. A. No one cares. B. Ppl who do care..dont. C. I dont like talking about my problems. There you have it folks. That makes it possible.  Im gonna go talk to some more ppl. (which means ima go aimlessly click the screen) It's gonna take more than just a flotation device to save me.

I'm Anti-Valentines Day. What about you?   Well, it's still early in the day, so something might happen.  Woops! I lied. The guys (Harry, Dan, Joe, maybies Bob?) are comming over, and are bringing there instruments! What a first! They won't be here until noon-ish. That means I hafta practice my part and stuff before then. Yeah. I was in a really good mood yesterday.   Was.  I don't understand anything anymore. I thought I had a concept of how everything worked, but I dont. I totally have no clue.  Remember back in like 4th grade, we would have to wear nametags and go around the room saying how we felt and things like that?  I wish I could do that again.  Later when the guys leave, I am going to have a horror movie marathon. Maybies. I might call Rachel Martin and see what she's up to this Valentines Day. Then we could go TO THE MALL! Yesh! Our Plans!   For the record. My 'curse' is gone.   People are really stupid. I felt like I should make that known. Yeah I might go see Trapt on the 17th. That would be so awesome. There playing up in Struthers for $15. I dont know if I really want to go, but Dad is excited about it, and that's rad.  Track starts in less han a month. That is so kickass. I gotta go get my physical, and I hafta go get new shoes. The last pair dissapeared. I have no clue where they went. Im gonna go listen to Brand New.  Im also going to go make a Anti-Valentines Day mix. Haha! Im sucha lozer! Yay!       What is your emo band name? by  urlLink  spiralinghalo        Your band name is:    Tuesday not Monday      You sound like:    The Dismemberment Plan      You will be signed to:    Vagrant Records      Your emo lyrics are:    'I hate myself, I&#39;m going to cry now'      Name:                  Created with  urlLink   quill18  's  urlLink  MemeGen 2.0  !
New Conclusions. My, my, my. This could get interesting.  Yeah, today we had early dismissal. That means more online time!  I have like no life. I made the amazing new discovery that I absolulty am over the past, and I could care less! It's great. I feel so happy.  I havent felt that way in a long time. (yes, that means i feel ska.) Today, when I woke up, I thought about nothing at all. I had no worries, I had no complains (except it was too early and I was still tired) no stress about anything. I found by the way a new band that is awesome. Well, they may not be new, but they are awesome. 'The Postal Service' I love it! Its like emo-trance-bright-eyes goodness!  I need some more pink lemonade. That stuff makes it possible! I'll take 'O' for the win.  Oh, we suceeded in finding my ska thing. Yeah. As odd as it may sound, it's emo music, but in the same sense it's something else. Yeah I guess you could say that. Hum. ^ there a good band too! Goodness, Sarah's rapidly increasing A.D.D case is slowly wearing off onto me. I can tell.  I cant wait. I want to make a movie, 'The true life, of ding dong ditch.' And go around and play the prank on lots of people, and have me catch it all on film. That would be ah-mazing. I was kinda depressed today. I didnt get any carnations. At all. Everyone else did, but not me. I wish I could of gotten a silly flower. Even though it will die just like everything else. But oh well! enough of the sad stuff! Im gonna skidattle. Who ever is reading this needs to sign the tagboard. Yeah. Thats right. lol.
If I told you that today was a very eventful than I was wrong. This could GET eventful!   --Finish Later. I've got some talking to a certain person to do.--  Wow. Yeah that was awesome. Okay. Besides that. Today has been very boring. As always.  Tommarow we get out early. That will rock. I might end up riding the bus home with Sarah and spend the night over there. That would get interesting. We go absolutly crazy. haha. I dont know. I have been in a really good mood today. For some randomly odd reason. *wink* I better skidattle. Sign the tagboard thing. Its awesome. Yeah. Go kick some ass.
Yeah. It's been a few days. Today, I realized just how much my life sucks. All I do is come home, go straight to the internet, get off, read, do homework and go to sleep. Im the ephiphany of a geek.  Theres a new kid in school. Got a good sense of humor, nice personality. Someone I need to get to know better. Yeah. Valentine's Day is in three days. Oh, joy. Another Valentines Day wasted on my own self loathing because im too big of a loser to have anyone. Go me. And me and sarah's buisness hasnt recieved any customers. Yeah. Thats what I thought. If I could see into the future when I was 6, and see just how I turned out, I would killed myself then. I'll take 'X' for the block. School does nothing but bore me anymore. The only class I actually enjoy would be Algebra because it's a challenge, Public Speaking because Kozar is a riot and the people are awesome in there. And French is above all because it owns. Dont listen to 'I love you, Not' by Homegrown. Its nothing but a flashback. Yeah all my entries are like I have ADD. Random Comment here, there. There everywhere. I'm thinking about everything wayy to much again. When that happens I start feeling sick. I feel sick. Why cant anything good ever happen to me? I think I've paid my dues. Something good hasta happen. You would think. You would also think wrong.  Yeah Im gonna go. I need to work on this gay template and figure stuff out.  I dont care anymore.
Yeah today really sucked. First of all, I didnt get enough sleep last night. Plus I was stupid and took 3 advil before I layed down. That means I'll be sick for the rest of the week. Yay, for me.  'Mistakes are misleading, you shouldnt think what youre feeling..' Death Cab for Cutie - Lightness.  Wow. That has never been any clearer to me. I need to talk to Rachel. I talked to her for quite a while online. Yeah. Were both basically in the same boat. She will be very interested in what I hafta inform her of. Yay.  'He always enjoed being the bearer of bad news..'  Igby goes Down - Olie  Same here. Wow. Maybe you should call me Igby. Lmao! O yea!
Yeah, I know I havent written in here since, forever. Alot has been going on. Well not that you could easily tell, with my lack of communication to the outside world. Yeah I have been thinking about lots of stuff. You know, that it is never good when I think about lots of things. Such an interesting frame of mind. I dont care anymore.  I wish that I could come right out and say everything that I have ever wanted, to whoever I wanted. Maybe all of this would then go away. Everywhere I go it seems that I unleash another memory. It has almost been 6 months and I still can't seem to get a grasp on anything. Like yesterday, I went to Best Buy to get 'Death cab for Cutie' because im in love with like 4 songs off of it, and when I walked down the cd aisle I passed this guy, and at that moment I got the largest wiff of axe from him. That brings back too many itself.  Last time I said anything about it to someone, I got relayed back to him. That's not gonna happen again. I watched the greatest film that I have ever seen in a long time last night. Its called 'Igby goes down.' Wowzers. It was so powerful. It has Kieran Culkin, who is, for those of you who dont put two and two together McCaulay Culkin's younger brother..the 'Home Alone' kid. Yeah... Anyways the movie held to many truths to my own life that I dont want to go into detail about and bore you with, so i'll save you from that.  Ok, I in relation to what is going on in my head I have kinda reached some questions that I cant quite seem to answer because I dont have all of the answers.  If a person reaches a point of lonliness, does that person slowly start to forget about what made them sad in the first place? Like do they get to a point where its such a culmination of a million things that they forget who or what has caused it from the start?  I think I have. I dont know. Im gonna go. Maybies I can get the guys to come over tomarrow. I hope so. Its so boring when they dont come over. Especially in the winter because there is absolutly nothing to do.
Bah. Bah. Forget it.  Nothing more. Yeah Yeah Yeah.  Woo. No. I said hell now. I mean no!  Fiznucking Shiz! ^^Gotta love espio!

Crammed - Packed - Never - Ending - Weekend - Of - Mayhem. Wo0o0o.  Okay. I've got nothing to rant, nor rave about this weekend, so I guess I'll just describe to you what I did. That works.  Friday - Had early dismissal. Blah. Came home, ate, went online, and sat around until about 2:45. Then I went back to school so I could go to track practice. Yeah, I was there until about 4:30. Though, all we did was streches, blocks and 3/100's. Easy practice for Saturday. After when I came home, I did nothing, but sit around. Boring. Saturday - Got up at 7, because of my loud and ingnorant father who decided to be loud when he was getting ready for class woke me up. Left at 8:30, and stopped at the gerocry store so I could get some powerade ^_^'  continued up to the school where the bus left at 9:00, got to Austintown/Fitch at 9:30, ran the 100 in 19.5 seconds, and ran the 200 in 41.3 seconds (I could of been faster in both, damn blocks!!) I didn't get home from that until 4:30. So when I came home, I was in a really good mood, and I played a little volleyball, and sat around, until randomly Harry showed up in my house, soon followed by Dan and Ryan. Then, they ubducted me, and we went down to the school, so I could film Dan trying to do a ollie over a skateboard, on a skateboard in 13 takes >  While I was down there, I called back to my house to let my mom know where I was, and I asked her if I could spend the night. So I did, and we ended up sitting around playing the 007 game, which was being gay as hell, and Harry kept using my shoulder as a pillow, so we all ended up going to bed at like 2:30.  Sunday - Woke up at 9:30, and sat in the living room because no one else was up yet. When  everyone finally got up we all watched Weird Science (except Dan, because he was still sleeping, until he left at like 10:45) and then Dazed and Confused, I left around 1:30. Came home, ate something and did some shiz on the computer.  The guys showed up at my house at like 2:00 - ish, and then we walked to downtown Sharon, where we sat around for a few hours. Walked back to my house at 5 - ish, layed around for a hour or so, and attempted to play twister until my mom came home ><. Then, they left at 6:30 - ish. Since then I have been doing a combination of computer/cleaning/dinner/bath/alias. Yeah. Well Ima go. Alias comes on in 2 mins! Woo.
Yeah, That's right. I really hate people.  I take that back. I only hate certian person/persons.  You guessed it ladies and gents. This calls for another round of 'Things that make Heather incredibly angry.'  Round 1! Okay. Sometimes people have more than friendship feelings for somebody else. Therefor, that person wants to get closer to the other person, for this instance we'll use 'victim' in refrence to the other person. . . Kay. At the same time the 'hunter' is hoping that the 'vicim' feels the same way. Now, normally, the 'vicim' would show this by a thing called massive flirting, more than norm contact (verbally and Physically) and by many other things. We like to call that leading the 'hunter' on. If any of you are not familiar with anything I have just been ranting about, I suggest locking yourself in your room, listing to mad amounts of emo, and if you are totally lost, call Ben. . .  Continuing. Now, there are circumstances,  when the 'vicim' is, how should I put this, socially retarded. Well, Ima put this into diffrent terms. There basically users. Gay friznucking assed users. ArGh! That makes me so mad. And if you dont know who I am talking about, I honestly dont think you have any right to be reading this.  Oh well. Im going to go, were all going over to Harry's and then to the buhl club for swimming.
Yeah. It's been a while..again! Alright. It's not like I can ask you what you want to hear first the good news or the bad news. So, I'll give you the good first. (Plus, I dont actually have bad news, other than my life.)  Good Shiz: I get my permit in a month. Which is awesome! Yeah, cuz today is the 20th and my bday is October 20th. (keep that in mind) So next month is my 15 and a half cele! w00t!  Bad Shizncking Shiz: Nothing has really changed with me so far. Other than the fact I don't like a certian person that will remain unmentioned, because of the fact, I am not 'outgoing' and I am a quiet person. *cough* So I'm just calling it quits on that little project. Well, last night at the mall with the guys, (Bob/Dan/Harry/Chris/Joe-ish Tonight's gonna be fun too! Were all heading over to Bob's house (same people) and watching a few good movies! Yay! I dunno when i'll be home, Im not heading over there until 5:30-ishel. It will be another late night event! But thats okies, because I don't have track in the morining. That is awesome. I def. need a day off. But I think they are comming over tomarrow. That will be cool too. I have so much fun when I am around them. Oh well. I gotta go. Im leaving in a little, have ppl to talk ta yets. I'll write later.
Yeah, I know it's been a while. But. My damn internet was down because of the stupid friznucking people at sbc doesnt know what the hell they are doing. And. I have had track for the past week. Im really tired. A-Kay. People are really starting to get on my last neve. I mean, people that I thought were my best friends, are randomly starting to hide things from me. What ever happened to telling people things. Not just any people or person, your friend. I mean, you guys know me. Im a layed back person. Im not one to over react about anything..well almost anything. I don't understand you people anymore.  I take that back. I don't understand you.  Yeah, you thought it was bad right? >Wrong. Bad only justifys the skin of things. If you want to save me, I'll be endebted to you forever.
WoWzErZ!! Rachel Martin just made my day! She's the best! She's such a sista! lmao! That is soooo PiMp!
-Song- 'I'll Catch You'  The Get Up Kids -Mood- Througly depressed.  Wow. Today was such a fun day!  Wow. I can lie really good.  I don't know what's wrong with me anymore. Maybe it's because I don't wanna know.There's so many things that make everything so wrong. It's too hard to concentrate on them all. I wish I could just spill my heart out to some one, but I can't find anyone who would want to listen that hasn't hurd it all before. My life is one big block of cheese. It just sits there and let's the world take it's tole without fighting back. That is soooo not pimp. I need to loose weight and fast. I also need to run some for track before it actually starts. I have been lifting though, that way when I gotta throw, I have a arm. I don't know if I want to go to that ska concert now. I might, but I dunno. I havent been feeling the slightest bit of ska latley. That is definitly not pimp. Bah Humbug. If anyone would like to come and save me one of these days, I'd be more than happy to be saved. Ima go before I get you sad. Don't feel bad. No one does anywho.
-Song- ''All we ever needed'' The Early November -Mood-  ..umm..cheese danishes..  Um, yeah. Today was really boring. You have no clue.  I'm reading this new series, it's pretty nifty. Called 'Jing: King of Bandits' Deals with a guy called Jing and his crow/assistant named Kir. It shows a bunch of diffrent things. Theres also pirates in it. That score's it about 10 points extra.  Deary me, I am so excited. Track starts next week, that means, I HAVE to go on a diet. I need to workout more. The only problem is, I don't have determination enough to stick to any solid routine. Bah.  I havent had pop in like, a week. That is awesome. Not really. I want some now.  No, I do not have chipmunk cheeks.  I wonder what it would look like if I wrote everything backwards.. sdrawkcab gnihtyreve etorw I fi ekil kool dluow ti tahw rednow I.. ^^ That was so nifty! You know what I hate? Well, theres alot of things, but let's zoom in on one.. I hate when people use me, and then try and pull it off like they did nothing. Argh. It makes me so mad. I dont care anymore. Not anymore. bah.
-Song- 'Capitalism stole my virginity' The (International) Noise Conspiracy -Mood- Been Better.  Sorry I didn't write yesterday, but I was gone almost the whole day. But it was fun. Haha. The guys are amazed at my video game playing skills. They didnt think I could play. But I can. Today was just another blur, nothing good has happened. As usual. I want to go to the last fall from between show, at North Sharon Firehall, but Nooo Im not allowed. I might hafta make it another secret mission..
Well. I had a good day of workin' out today. -Phew!- We did 10 grovers, and a 800 meter run (two laps) then we did 100 of backpedals, knee-highs and butt-kicks. Fun for the whole family. Im really glad I joined track this year, because I've lost alot of fat. I need to loose more though, so I can be less fat.
'Whispering Actually' - I Can Make A Mess Like Nobody's Buisness Everyone needs to go download this song . www.purevolume.com Yeah, if you don't your lame. Seriously.  Shiz. I need to go get the new episode of Red vs. Blue. It came out today. Gotta love it.  I'm so stupid. Seriously dude. I don't even know anymore. Nor do I want to. Yeah, Im going to go. All I can do is ramble.
-Sigh- I have no clue what is going to happen. You know, I thought I was at a perfect situation. I had plenty of people that I hung out with, I had very good grades, hell, I even made it on the honor roll with a 3.9 gpa. I ran in track, and each time I ran, I got better. What could be better? Honestly. But now, I don't know. I hate where I live, the people I've hung out with don't want to hang out with me, nor talk to me. My grades in some of my classes are starting to slip because I've been doing so much, I haven't the time to study and do all my homework. It seems as though all that has ment anything to me, is just slipping away. And, of coarse it had to happen right before summer vacation. Why?. This always happens. Can't I be happy? For more than a 8 or 9 month amount of time? Seriously.  I just don't know anymore. I don't know anything.  I need to go listen to more of The Early November. Then, I need to go to sleep, where I don't realize how shizzy things have gotten. .. Way away, away from here I'll be....
-I have had it up to here. Go take your shiz somewhere else. -  Honestly folks. I can't stand any of you anymore. Well.. maybe some of you..but only a select few! Argh.  I dont feel like talking. No one cares. I need some sleep. Go have fun with your friends.
You know what? - I can't stand this anymore. Why can't I say what I want to say? I want to sit everyone down, and tell them exactly what I feel, why I feel it. I don't want to just play around anymore. This sucks like a mother. I still don't feel like talking. Tomarrow is gonna be fun. O yeah. I get to do the 1600, 4 X 2 relay, the 200m dash, and the longjump. Great. Yeah, so I guess Im a distance runner now. That kinda sucks. But, it's okay.  Tomarrow will be fun. As long as I think that I've got nothing to loose..right? I hope so. I need to make a new mix for track. That way I've got stuff I can think of.  Saving me from all of this, would just be too much for you. Don't bother.
Why do you people think I'm going to flip out about everything? -I don't get any of you.  I told you before I'm not a mean person. Why must you act like I am?  I don't feel like much talking, except for a few people. And most likely you arn't one of them.
Wow. That's all I can say is wow.  Sometimes people never fail to surprize me, even now.  If you spend enough time with a person, when it's just you and them, the person can turn out to be almost completly diffrent than they normally act around you. I definitly have a new respect for someone.  Yes, that's right folks. I have absolutly no courage. None. It's definitly not there.  But I'm also lacking major in the self-esteem, self-confidence, all of the above. Yeah. I think I might need to work on that in order to aproch the aproch-ee. Yeah, about that, I'm definitly not saying anything to anyone else. Word gets out. Easily.  I'm definitly going on a hour and a half of sleep. That's so not cool man. I didn't sleep until about 9 in the morning until about 10:30. But, for some odd reason I'm okay. I mean, I had the all day track meet @ East Palestine from 7:30 a.m. until almost 6:00 p.m. when I got home, then I walked down to Harry's hung out there, came home and got my clothes, went back down and hung out all night. And, I basically just got home. Sounds like loads of fun, right? Damn right it was fun. Wow. I bet you wern't expecting me to say that, were ya? Well. So what. I can't wait to talk to someone! Seriously!  When I wasn't talking to this person, he was always online. And now that I'm not, he's not on. Go figure. That's okay.  He's still talking to me.  Does that make me Mary? Wow. I hafta talk to Rachel Martin today. I have somethings to tell her, a few updates. It'll be gravy, and she'll be mad, then she'll be sad, and it won't be gravy anymore. It will suck. But that's okay, because that's what I'm here for! I listen to everyone's problems! I don't know why, I just do. I don't like to all the time, but I honestly can't be mean. I don't have it in me. I wish that I could be mean sometimes, just to know what it's like, then I'd want to turn back because I don't think that I could go that long with out cracking a joke, or being anti-mean.  Some people think I am mean already.  I don't think I'm mean.  You know what? I am so totally just rambling on and on and on and on in this entry it's crazy shiz pimp. That's right. I guess that's what happens when you get this little of sleep, worry about everything that's going to happen, are mad hungry and kinda bored out of your mind because there is no one here besides, me and the 'rents. It's amazing that I can go from never being allowed to do anything, to actually finding that I barley spend anytime at home. Not like that's a bad thing or anything, because it's all fun and games, but I do get tired after a while. Like riight now. I'm so freaking sleepy man. Oh well. It was fun. No regrets right? I think I need to stop worrying so much. That's not good. I think it might be making me go bald. Even though I'm not going bald. It might soon if I don't stop.  Im going to go, before I ramble on even more. Blah. See YOU on the flip to the dip side.
Alright folks. Welcome to another addition of the special brodcasts from random people's homes!!  For  this lovley Saturday night, Im talking to you from Harry's house. Everyone is basically over, it's gonna be a party! w00t. Yeah, I had  that track meet this morning at like 7:30 til about 6-ish. That was so not fun! But, I didnt get as burned as I did last weekend. Thats a good thing. Im still in a crappy mood from last night. But Im kinda better now. I guess. But not like that matters. I dont care anymore.  I have the get up kids stuck in my head, I really want to talk to somebody in perticular, and I can't which makes me mad, but im not a home, so that makes me un-mad....just a little. Im gonna go. Prolly be back later.  Somebody Save me.
I was thinking.  What is it about me that drives people away? I'm serious as all hell about this one too.  Is there something that I do that people dont like, and they just dont tell me about? If there is, you should let me know, because I hate feeling like this. Especially when I have no one to talk to, and I'm just stuck thinking about it forever. That's never a good thing.  I just don't know. I don't think I wanna know. Please don't tell me it's because I'm 'emo'. I've hurd enough of that to last me a lifetime and then some.  I'm going to bed. Track meet tomarrow morning @ 7:30 a.m. See you there.
I realized something today. It doesn't matter what I do.  Nothing seems to matter. The world does not care what I do. Which completly screws with the concept of this journal it's self. Never the less. I'm sure a few of you get a joy out of reading this. It just hit me. Like that.
Wow. That's all I'm saying kids, Wow. I love that show. I want to go back. I need to go back.  I need to listen to Mustard Plug and Big D.  Can anyone help a sista out? Of you do, I'll owe you big. And I mean big.
Well Kids. Tonight is the big show.  Actually, it's not really big.  There's only four bands, Planet Smashers, Catch 22, Mustard Plug and Big D and the kids table. That's not that many. I miss Warped Tour.  I'm taking the guys up..too bad I don't think I'm taking god up. That would rock rock rock. If god graces me with his presence tonight, I'll be a happy girl. I'll also be a happy girl if I meet some new boys. That's right. Another song you kids need is 'Long Goodnight,' by the get up kids, and 'I belive in a thing called love,' by the darkness. Those are pretty nifty selections. I actually wanted to catch some sleep before we hit the road, but I don't know if I'll be able too. Ugh. This will be interesting. Esecially because I have a high hate-tred, for ska. Yes, I know. That makes no sense, and why am I going right? Well, put it too you this way, it's a show, and It's in Cleveland, only $10 and I'm going with the guys. I've never been to a show with them. This will be fun! .. I think .. If I don't die in the pit first.  I'm going to go, if anyone wants to come along tonight, your more than welcome. Just bring some powerade and all will be fine.
This sucks, and like everything else in life, it is going to turn out bad. Because, I'm sorry to break it to you folks, luck just doesn't happen. Luck is man made. Luck is won over and bought just like everything else in this world. I hate what society has done to society. If you watch movies from era's like the 50's, 60's and such, they all look so comfortable. Comfortable with their friends, homes, and everything that was going on around them. Why can't it be like that now? If anyone can answer that for me, I'll owe it too you, because nothing good ever happens to me.
I'm just plain tired kids. I've got no more motivation, no energy, and no expectations. If this isn't the low life, I don't know what is. I could really care less about writing in here today, but there's nothing else too do. I might see if the guys want to help me film. I don't know. Today isn't a good day. I need someone to come over. . .If anyone would like to save me, I will love you forever. I think. </3
Hey folks. This is a special entry, cuz Im writing from my Aunt Kathy's house. Yesterday was so long and boring I don't even know where to start.  I ended up waking up at like 6:30 yesterday, and went to track at like 10. The meet was at Mineral Ridge. We were there until seven freaking oh clock.  Not to mention I also look like a freak, since harry injured my eye with the fake sword, and I got so sunburnt that I hurt. I really need to do some filming. I only have three days left to get my video done. Now, I really feel like a director. Seriously.  I want to watch the first season of Red vs. Blue. But. I've been so freaking busy it's not even funny.  I can't belive school is almost over. We only have like less than two months left. To me, that's both sad and great at the same time. I definitly cannot wait until I graduate. That way I can leave and move to New York City. If anyone else would like to tag along with me let me know.  I honestly dont know if I want to go to California. I mean, I do. I think it would be really fun. But I dont know. I know that I need to be alone and on my own for a while.  I don't see where that would differ from now. I mean, I'm honestly like never home anymore. I'm usually always either, at School, Track, or I'm at Harry's.  And usually if I am at home, the guys  always end up stopping over or something.  My mom thinks that its odd that I only have a few friends that are girls.  I don't know why I don't. I mean, yeah, there nice to talk to and all, but I barley have anything in common with any of them. The only girls Im really friends with are Rachel and Sarah. Well, there are others, but I don't ever talk to them or hang out with them outside of school. I wonder why they took off the show, where in the world is Carmen San Diego? I don't get that. I get to have pop now. But really, I don't  want it. I just don't.  It tastes really funny and I don't feel to good after it.  You all need to go listen to Muse. I love this band. There really awesome. I mean so awesomerific that I can't even hand gesture it enough to you!  If anyone has any tips on how to woo someone, let me know. I need them desperatly. Yes, that's right folks. I said desperatly.  Well, Im going to skidattle, because this internet is really gay (I love you dsl!) and I gotta get ready to go home.  Always.
You know what? I hate everything about this. I can't stand it anymore. I really can't. Everytime I think thimgs maybe looking up, they pull a 180, and smack me right in the head.  I can't stand any of this anymore. Why do I have to sacrifice so much, for someone, to make them a better person, when it's most likly hurting me a hundred times more. I don't get it. Maybe I just don't want to get it.  I'm ready to move now. If I had some money, I'd buy a train, plane or bus ticket now, go to NYC and forget about all of this. Start out new. That's what I need to do. I can't keep going through this. If I do, I think, in time, my head will explode. Even though death itself isn't horrible, I don't think I want to be remembered as the human bomb.  I don't get anything anymore. Life isn't life anymore. It's a system of chores, that require no thought. All anything is. A system. That has too many faults. Maybe if I was cooler, and maybe if I talked more, maybe if I was pretty, people would like me too. (When I say people I mean guys.)  I don't know. I guess I just need to change something. Cuz this system I have going for myself, isn't doing anything for me. I don't feel like talking anymore. Im going to go.
Yeah! This is my 100th post. That is  so nifty!  Go figure, this is a special post, and I'm  not even making it from my own house.  O yeah, by the way this is another edition of posting from a random persons house. How  great is that. Im sitting in Joe's living room, with Dan Harry and  Joe.
Hibb-itty-hibb-hib im so freaking happy! Today was such a good great awesomrifical day! I can't wait till tomarrow. the parade @ 9, ugh...and then the cookout/thinger at Joe's house. thats gonna be awesome. ima go..bored.
Yeah. Yeah.  I'd say today was a pretty good day. Nothing too exciting. Haha. Rachel Martin said something to Jon before I got a chance too. I guess it went a little something like this.. Rachel- So, How's Dan? Jon - ...Ookay I guess.. Rachel- So..How's Dan and Heather..? Jon - *ponders..* HEATHER? Rachel - Well, not yet, but uhh.. Jon - Dan's a fag.   Well, if that wasn't the best ice breaker I've ever seen.. or hurd I should say, ya know. That's great.  This summer's gonna be fun. Parties. Sleepovers. Parties. Lan Parties. Sleepover-ness. Shows-nessles. Oh yeah.  I dunno. I'm rambling now. I'm skidattle. Cheers!
Confused? Yes. Worried? A little. Extreamly Happy? Definitly. I think it'd work. Even with all the doubt floating around.  I have so much freaking stuff to do. Crazy. I have to do three algebra assignments, two are due tomarrow. One is due on Wednesday. I have a Journal, Study Guides, and and Essay due through out the week, let alone the test on the gayest book in the world..'Of Mice and Men..' horrible. I can't read it without falling asleep. Argh. Things are slowly going to start improving though. I know it.  'I've seen the smiles fall to many times before, let me ask you is this what you've been waiting for?' Eep.
Blah-diddle Blah Blah Blah. Today has been so boring. Seriously dude. I've done nothing but work on my PS speech and VA and then I had to finish reading 'Of Mice and Men.' I hate that book with a passion. Steinback may be a very respectable author, but where the hell did he come up with an idea for that book? Crazy Bastard. And on top of that, I have to write an essay which is due tuesday, on that book. It's so not fair. I can't even read 10 pages without dozing off, or falling asleep completly. Ugh.  I want to get the guys together, and go to chineese, and then to the movies. It sounds like some fun.  I can't wait until marching this summer. It's going to be so much freaking fun. I'm going to be so sad though, because Steph, Tj, Doc, Browning, all of them are going to be senior's next year. It's not fair. When the guy's grade goes, I'm going to be so screwed. Thats why I have to make the BEST of it now. haha. O yeah. Tomarrrow's gonna be fun. Eep. I'll write either later if I get bored, or tomarrow...Cheers'
Today has definitly been the best day that I think I've had in quite a while. I mean seriously, I think if anything..well almost anything would have been any diffrent, then I don't think I would of had that great of a time.  I'm so happy. You know that feeling you get when someone likes you, and you like them, even though you're not together, it's still so much freaking fun?  Yeah, that's what I've got right now.  I definitly have gotten to know and hang out more with a certain someone. It kinda makes me sad to know that because of a certain person, I've missed out on knowing them all of this time. Maybe something would of happened earlier if I could of but all that shiz behind me earlier. Oh well. I'm not going to let it bother me..why? Because on the rare occasion that I can honestly say I'm happy..I don't want to miss any second of it. Yeah. I'm definitly going to go to sleep now. I'm so freaking tired. Cheers and Goodnight to ya all!
This year has gone by really fast. Like really really ridiculously fast. It stil kinda feels like the first day of school. I don't know. Maybe thats just because I'm a big weird-ball. Who knows. Oo0. I might get to play piccolo in Marching Band. That's kinda cool. I'd rather be play drums, but hey, it's not a flute. I gotta go do the Relay for Life tonight. I'm glad I'm doing it. Not only for community service, but for Grandma, Uncle Russel, and Aunt Mary. I can't belive they've all past away in the last 9 months. All from the same thing too. Lung Cancer. I hate that..so don't even get me started... Tomarrow is the band trip!! I'm so freaking excited! Harry's not going to be there, which, I mean, yeah he's like one of my best friends and all, but uhh, yeah. This will definitly give me a break. And I'll be able to hang out with Dan, without having Harry all over me. That's cool. Yeah, if Jon is reading this because he clicked the link in my profile, please talk to your brother. Seriously. wth is up with that, ya know? Thaaaaanks. Well, I'm going to go. I wanna sleep a little or do some algbra..gawd. I'll prolly write more after R.F.L or Sunday. Cheers.
Today was such a horrible day. You have absolutly no fucking clue. I all I could do was sit there and think about all the shiz that's been going on, some of the shiz that happend last night, and everything else. It definitly sucked. Dunno. Might see what the guys are doing, since I have nothing better to do. We'll see. Have fun folks.
How can spending so much time with one person, make them mean so much to you, even though, you know, they don't think of you as anything?..I don't know what to think anymore. Things like this make me so aggravated. You have no clue.
You know what, after spending the weekend alone, I've came to alot of conclusions. I've realized what I've got in life, what I thought I had in life, and what I need. It's almost disappointing, but at the same time, it's motivation to work towards all of that.  I found out who I don't want anymore.  I also realized I definitly need to stop living in the past. All that shiz that went down this past summer, is all that it is..the past. Nothing more. I'm honestly trying not to care anymore. Woah. Summertime self-real-eyes-ation at it's finest folks. Hope you all enjoy.
Today has been a good day so far. I guess. I didn't go to track today, dad didnt let me. So, I went and took the test portion of my permit thing, and I passed that. I'm so happy. But I feel sick and I'm really hungry, so you wouldnt be able to tell if you saw me. Have I ever told you how much I love Ramen. I love ramen alot. Lot's and lot's. Yup. All-Righty. I think after we get done gerocery shopping, I'm going to see what the guys are up to. Then, maybe we can hangout or whatever. Dunno. I'll write later.
It's 7:54 in the morning and im up because, last night, I went tanning, and I've ended up looking mildly like a lobster. I hurt so bad. Also, I have track in about an hour, and I'm feeling really nauseaus. Weather it's from the tanning thing, not getting a good nights sleep, or the medicine, because I am sick, I don't know. Last night, I do know, when I got up to put lotion on, I got really dizzy and felt like I did when I passed out that one time. And that's not good because I have alot of stuff to do today. I have to get the part B thing, go to the bank, put in app. at the golf coarse, and stop in at T-Mobile. Ughhh..So much to do. So little time. I'm glad though. I'ma get my yearbook on Monday. I've got to get some -people- to sign it. Man, I think I'ma be sick. Bah. O yeah, I definitly had the weirdest dream last night. Something about aliens, and a guy, and hubbard, and random kids, bible questions, french kids. I don't know. It was too much chaos for me so I just woke up. lmao. I don't want to do anything today. I feel so blah. Oh well. I don't think anyone cares. I'ma go step outside for a few. Maybe the fresh air will help me. Hoping. I'll write in here tonight.
I've been trying to watch this World News stuff, okay. All you see, are the little Iraqi, and Palestinian kids, throwing stuff at our boys over there, and all I have to say, are where the hell are there parents. I mean seriously dude. If I lived over there, my mom or dad would be like, Hel-l-oh get your rear in gear and get in this house, the USA is marching around Mr. Roger's neighborhood, with a few MK-40's and gernades. It's not safe to play in the street at times like these.  I want to move to Cocoa Beach. I want to surf again. I miss it. Makes me so sad.  Today wasn't a good day. For some reason, I've just been very depressed. Maybe because I've been thinking about everything. Like when I see, a few people..it's not good for me ya kno. . .Well you don't know, because. Yeah.  Its seriously hot outside. It's curently 82 in my house and it's 6:26. That's crazy. It's only May. It should be like 65 or 75. Then it would be comfortable. This d00ds, is not comfortable. My mother is driving me crazy. I was like, oh hey, I'm home and none of my friends felt like caring about me tonight, so i guess I'll speak a few words to my mother. No. Never again. Ah. And she repeats herself over and over and over again. My head is going to explode. I swear she's my source of constant headache. It's going to be impossible to stay here all summer. I hope she knows that. I'm def. going to be living at Harry, Bob or Dan's house. I don't care whose. Just as long as it's not my own.  I need a hobby besides being online I think. I spend hours on end in front of this thing. Ah-mazing. I think I've rambled enough. God, she won't shut up. Help me. If anyone can save me tonight, I'll owe you something big. Promise.
Bah. Today was a very interesting day. I missed fifth period today, which is a shame because I love that class more than any of my other classes. I love learning foreign languages. My dad's taking a summer spanish coarse this year, he's going to teach me how to do it. That will be really nifty. Then i'll be able to speak 3 languages by the time I'm 16. Awesome. You wanna know something? I'm really sick and tired of hearing about other people's problems. I mean, sometimes, if something happens, and they need someone to talk too, yeah of coarse I'm here for them. That's what friends doo. But when every single day, and it's the same problem, it gets really aggravating. Especially when the problem could have easily been avoided if they would have just payed attention in the first place. Why else do people make mistakes? . . . Just so other people can make them too and fall into the same hole? I don't think so.  I'm so glad tomarrow is Friday. Yay. I hope we don't have Saturday practice. I really really don't want to practice on the weekend. I've already got alot planned.  1.) Get part B done 2.) Put in app. at the golf coarse.  3.) Party somewhere.  I'm sure were all going to go spend the night at someone's house this weekend. It never fails. It's all good fun though don't get me wrong.  I think I'm going to go. I've got some french and algebra to get done. ya.
Hey there lazy chair! I figured since they reformatted Blog, I needed to have a catchy phrase. Ya know. Tac-8 Meet is tomarrow, for all of you interested, the field events start at 4:30 and the running events start at 5:00 @ Newton Falls. So if you're in the area, it's gonna take you a while ta get there. I'm running in the ever-popular 200m Dash and the 400m Dash. It's kinda sad though. That means we only have one meet left, that we all get to participate in. Reginals arn't until Thursday of next week. But, I got my pah-stah and my gatorade with water on the side..so I should be fine and dandy. Welp. I'm going to go. Stizuff to do yet. I'ma write in here later. Because I feel like it.
My head is going to explode. Evangelion will make you go insane. I'm gonna end up like Auska if I keep it up. I need to write in my real journal more often too much has built up. Argh.
Yeah. Track rocks. ShinSplints suck.  Im in like unbeliveable pain, 24/7. It's crazy. Season is almost over, along with school. This freshman year has gone by so fast.  It's like it was yesterday I was just starting to hang out with the guys, and I was so self-concious around them. And everyone else for the matter of fact. Boy. I'm still self-concious, but I think that I do a good job hiding it from everyone, so atleast it doesnt seem like I am. I've also made a few good friends along the way. Lost some too. Thats some crazy shiz right there lemme tell you. I don't think I've really changed emotionally too much though. I'm still wah. All over the place. I'm really happy, or really sad. There's not much in between.  I really need to finish watching Evangelion. I loooooooooove that anime with all my heart. Seriously. All of it. Corey is totally awesome for letting me borrow all 13 tapes of it.  I'm still single. As always. Like that is ever going to change. I'm telling you, Im going to die an old and decreped old lady whose never ever been married. So sad. Arhgg. I'm going to go and see what the guys are up too, then, I can figure out what I'm going to do tonight. I can tell you one thing, I won't be home.  Saving me would be too much charity for the likes of you.
Would it all be better if I wasn't here?  You know, just as I thought I had things figured out, they of coarse had to go ahead and change.  I thought I knew what I wanted, where I was going in life, what I was going to do in life. I guess when you get too comfortable with that kind of thing all hell must break loose. Because it surley is causing havoc now. I mean, why the hell do I even bother anymore. It leads me no where, and always seems to dissapoint me.  I thought that I would make my move, and maybe have a slight chance at being happy. Even if it was for a moment. You think that's going to happen now? Think again. Thought I was going to New York City when I graduated. Can't. Why because fucking colleges have decided to rob their students of funds, and make it extremly unaffordable to pay your way in. $43,185 a year. Believe it. And to top it all of, I just don't know anymore. Just a hint for you all, don't take tylenole thinking it will take away enough pain. Because it doesnt, and then it sucks. I would love to express all of this to 'the group' but how many tears can you shed until it gets too old. Seriously. I know they said I have to talk to them, because that is what we do, we talk. But heres a prime example of the old saying it's easier said than done. I've been like this for 15 (almost 16) years of my life. You'd think I'd be used to it by now. I almost am.  Maybe if I dressed up everyday, wittled away my fatness to nothing, and cared about absolutly nothing in the world, just maybe then I could be happy. Is it the pessimistic side of me that scares everyone away? No one has ever seen this side of me in person. This is what I keep to myself, and what i'd hate to put onto you guys because I don't think anyone needs to go thru exactly what I am going thru, because it's not their problems. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I don't want to have to do anything for myself. I just want to be okay. I don't care if I'm uberly happy, but I don't want to be like this. I just don't want to care anymore, because I don't care. But theres that thing in the corner of my mind, thats like, no, you must care because it is your life. You know, you  guys don't see me like this. You don't see any of it. All you see is the happy go lucky girl that is cool to be around. If you knew I was like this from the start, would you still want to be around me? I'm not a basketcase though. If that's what you're wondering. I just have no one I feel safe enough spilling all this too. And I really must say I hate all of the phoney people who pretend to care about what Im going thru. Because I hope you know that I can tell. I can see it, and I know. Let me tell you something. That's not cool d00d. not cool at all. why can't I just be able to say all of this. is it really that hard. or is it just the fact I havent found the right person to say this all too. it kills me on the inside. it really does. and i could write it all out, exactly what im feeling. when it comes to saying it though, i can't. or when i do i mess it up and everyone gets pissed off at me because i'm horrible at words. you guys wonder why i don't tell you people anything. there you go. i think what it is, is that im just not good enough. i mean, im good enough to hang out with, and too listen to everyones problems. but im just not it. how do i get like this? is it my subconcious building and building until it can't hold all of this and it spills out into my normal state of conciousness. because not long ago, i was fine. only three more years. just three. then maybe i can find what it takes to be happy. maybe i can find someone who understands me. because right now the only person i find myself to be happy around, couldnt care less about me. and hes not who you think he is. i guess it always has to come down to this, because alas this is all ive got. just me, and everything that i think about because i can't do anything else but think of things. then why the hell am i here? I dont know but i am starting to think it would all be better if I wasn't here. atleast not in brookfield. not in ohio. maybe not in the united states itself.
K, so I typed out a really really freaking long post today before I left, and my gay computer froze, so I had to reboot without saving. Sucks right? Yeah, I thought so too.  I st around for like the first half of the day. Yeah, fun for the whole family, it's assured. Then Me and Rach went to Jon's grad party for like an hour, I was kind of bummed that we had to leave before they played (they = ffb) but, I got my pic, and one of me and dan too. So I guess all was not lost.  Then after, I came over too Joo's, and met up with the gentlemen ( Harry, Bob, Joe and Ryan .. sadfully no dan.) Sheesh. Yeah, I'm still here. I actually got to spend the night for like once in a very long time. It's been like a week. Sucks!  The parents are stil being Nazi-ans. I swear it's all the mothers doing. If she's unhappy, she wants the rest of the known and free world to be unhappy right along with her. I can't wait til Dad starts his new job, that way he's home more in the afternoon ish. I swear, because of the habit of staying up until like 3am on the pc, I can't make it past like 12 with out a computer, Muse and water. I think I will die. Hold on. Okay. I just got really really depressed all of a sudden, I have no clue why. Maybe because this is what I do when I'm at home, and I'm always depressed there. I wish I wasn't. I think all of this is taking alot of me. I mean, I'm the mediator of the group. I listen to EVERYTHING thats going on with everybody, which I can't completly say that I dont like, because thats why Im here. But whenever I try to tell them my shiz, they always have to turn it into something about them. I hate that. And all the stuff between me and dan. Well I guess I should say lack of things that are going on between me and him. I like him so much, doesn't he realize this? I mean goodness. I hate it so bad. Great there making fun of me because im a vegetarian. what the heck. jeesh. I dont know anything anymore.  I wish I could have sometime alone. I guess not. OR atleast someone to talk to. I mean really talk too. But I dont have that either. Maybe I do need to move. Get away from everything. I'm too used to this pattern of things. I need change. If I had change, I would be okay I think. Maybe thats why I never kept friends for a long amount of time. Weird. Oh well. Maybe I think about all of this stuff way too much. That could be my problem. Then again, who knows? No one because everyone has their head wrapped around there own situation and there way to busy to listen to me. I dont care anymore. at all. Actually I do but heh, you guys sure as hell wouldnt know about that.
I didn't do much yesterday. I'm supposed to go to The Aquabats and Planet Smashers show today up at the agora. I really freaking want to go. But everyone counted on me as a ride, when I told them not too because things were up in the air, so alas, we have no ride. Dad's working up on the roof, and Mom has to be to work tomarrow at like 5 in the morning. Damn I wish I could drive. I haven't even gotten out on the road yet, when I've had my permit for about two months now. Things are startng to make me aggrivated. Maybe I need a break from people. I think that's what it is. People depend on me too much. Don't ask why. I don't know why they would be like that with me.  I'm going to go find something to do. Maybe I'll play some stuff on my guitar. Yeah, that sounds good. I'ma go jam. outz!
'From when I was very young it would always make me forget everything around from me and come into a very blissful, or simple, state. Throughout all my life it's been an escape from everything, and as you are in that process of escape you see all those layers peel away or all those things that imprison you in your life... To me that's the only thing that is me, everything else is down to evolution and where I was on the planet - I could have been anyone, and I'm trying to find the most basic, simplistic, form of what I am. I can relate to those moments in my life when I've been playing music - it's like music is my origin of symmetry.'   Okay. Too much? I never know. It sums up what music means too me, because someone, who im not mentioning, doesnt get it.
http://www.iliekmuse.now.nu/ ^ That has to be about the funniest thing I've seen all day. I suggest you check it out, you guys may not get the jokes though.  I don't know what I'm going to do today. The guys haven't called, so I might end up staying home the whole day. I need a big serving size meal of a life. Yeah.  I want to be in a band. OF coarse the 'band' we have now hasn't done anything, and at this rate, I don't think that we will be doing anything. The brother and Lilly came over today. Dunno. I didn't hang with them much. Bill and I are too quiet. Im gonna go. Find something to do. Maybe the guys will show up at the house.
Post 111: Everyone see the video for 'Uno' by Muse? If you have you'll know what I'm talking about. I'm so happy, I finally got my album thing up for everyone too look at. I just need more pics now. But I've got some from 'Ska is Dead,' and I'm going to that concert on Monday, hopefully *Crosses Fingers* I really wanna see The Planet Smashers! w00t.  Tomarrow is a big birthday extravaganza, Rachel Martin's turning 14 and Maggey's turning 16. That's nifty. I wish I had a summer birthday. No, mine has to be in the cold and rainey fall. Damn October 20th.   Can't wait until I turn 16, it's like in 4 months and 9 days. Something like that. Oh well. I'm definintly going to have a sweet birthday party. Atleast I hope. Might have my party in the summer. That way we can actually party. Insted of freezing lumberjack-style on the deck. I wanna have a super killer pool party. For the Cool Kids at my school. wow. i gotcha there. i got cha. do you have cha? hee hee.  That's super rad my friend.  I'm gonna go, so I can go do..well nothing but. Yeah. Ima skidattle.
I woke up at noon.  I feel like I need more sleep though.  Today's going to be boring, I can tell. I bet you any money that they won't call. Oh well. It bothers me, but I highly doubt they want to spend everyday with me. I don't know who would.  You know, it's only June 9th, and I'm already bored. Psh. This is going to be one long summer. Wonder when there going to Kansas. Need to find that out. Maybe me and someone can spend some good time together. Sounds like a plan. =). I don't know why I try so hard. I just do. I'd like to think I'm getting somewhere. Doubt it though.  I'm gonna go. Gotta find something to do. Cheers.  btw - Happy BDay Bells!
Up past 2 again. Sitting here, thinking way too much. I wish I didn't worry about everything the way I do. I don't know what to do about anything anymore. I try so hard, to make things go the way they should.   'and no reason why i should try to go on anymore my reason's all gone, no reason why you should try to make excuses to make me feel alright excuses call for stupid reasons and i know that it's not much that i can offer right now just give me one little second and i will try my hardest to make you feel like i'm someone else.' - Pretty, Pretty. T.E.N  Understand why I love that band. I don't want anyone to think I'm something I'm not. Or that Im a certain way that I'm not. I can't help it though. You people don't want to see me sad or depressed. I'm such a person pleaser, and I'm that in a way that I don't want people to get worried, or upset over me or something that someone else did. It's not fair to them. At the same time, it's not fair to me.  Why can't people just not rely on me too feel better. I hate this. I'm going to bed.
Woo! Today was so fun!! My mum woke me up at like, 10:30 and was like, hey we're going to the beach today so get going.. You know me in the morning.. So I was like, ...mumble mumble..guys..mumble mumble.. Yeah, I ended up using my ways and got Dan to go, then we all had to fit in my moms car. joyus. so it was joo in the passenger seat, and harry - me - dan in the back. Hee Hee. I liked the turns! =) Then we swam some, walked/skateborded/swam more/walked/sat around more you know. Then we came home. It was an overall nice day though. i hope we have more like that! I'll prolly write later, so b-y-e
Today was so freaking boring. Remind me never to go over there when the guys are playing video games. Never ever ever ever. Bah. Hopefully tomarrow will be better. . .We can all wish.  Flopp-ay-diskit. McArdean. Hee hee. Those never die. Ever. Kinda like the Lord of the Ring's trilogy. When you think/hope that it's finally over, wham bam thank you ma'am, it comes back with more shizzle to throw at cha. Ugh Sigh.  na na na na na... yah.
I think this is the second one of the day for me. oh well.It's kinda ironic how much time I actually spend in front of this computer. but hey, what else would I spend my time on. Laying outside is a given. I'm prolly going to do that later. due to the fact I have a horrible tanline. hee hee. i'm going down to harry's later. i haven't talked to him yet today so i don't know when, but i am. my stomach hurts. ugh. don't feel grand(e).  'this is what you hum you hum..WOAHH OH WHOA..' Ok-a, im bored. joy-fuuuul. fuul..cant you tell. 1234 1234.
'Won't you come over, You know that you want to. How does it feel to know I still want you? Why do we always seem to want what we can't have?' - The Ataris 'Between Me and You'   How fitting is this lyric snippit. Ah-mazing. I need to do something. I think I need to make a move towards the future. dun dun dun. i was going to put a ex-claim-ation mark there but its more interesting this way. very much so. im tired. been tired. shouldnt be tired. why. its vacation. boating was fun. we should do more of it. o ya. i also want to camp out in the backyard with the gentlemen. hee hee. it would be so much fun. absolutly.
urlLink      hee hee!  Wow. You know what. Some people dont realize what they have. id enjoy having something like that. some people ill never get. i cant wait till tomarrow. ill get to go back to harrys. that means more than likley dan - izzle will be there. spells fun for me. yea. after that last post i went to harrys house from like 6 til 1030 almost 11 ish. gotta love it over there. ima skidattle. prolly write later when the rents go to sleep. enjoy!
Took the boat out today. Fun Fun Fun. Makes me miss the ocean terribly so. Might go see john mayer and maroon 5. why you ask. because it would be a free concert with the aunts in columbus. joyful. warped tour is in like a month or so. im so damn happy. im bored. i cant stand to be bored but i am. i want to hang out with the guys. but id have to find them first. i also want to hang out with dan. but thats not going to happen without the other guys around. jooo-y. i want to surf. its not fair being here all the time. i wish i could just pick up my shiz and go to cocoa beach for like a week. that's all i ask. a week. im going to go. have to find something to do. joy-us.
It's over already? I guess time fly's when you're having fun. Or not.. Yesterday was so much fun! Atleast for the first part. All I had to do was take the World History exam, then I was done. I passed it with a 97%. I'm happy. Then I walked to Joo's house and met up with him, Harry, Bob and Maggey. Yeah Dan came later. So we all hung out, Maggey left at like half - past noon-ish. Then we all just kinda sat around, trampoline, watched Bob play starcraft, a few movies, ect. Yeah. Then I called my mom and asked her if I could spend the night, so of coarse she was like, 'Yeah of coarse.' So she came and got me, and on the way to the house to pick stuff up for later, she was like, im seriously debating about leaving your father, and im going to look for an apartment in Niles, and ect. all while I was going to leave in a half hour to meet up with the guys. Right. So I didn't let it bother me. Then, my dad called, and was like, flipping out on me. He was like, I didnt raise you for 16 years to just run all the damn time, and you're being such a dissapointment, and blah blah blah. It didn't help, I could of probably told you and made a bet on the fact that he was drinking previously to this, as he always seems to do, every single fucking night, it never ends. I always thought he was the one I could stand the most, now, Im beginning to take it all back. Of coarse I was outside when I was talking to him, they were watching TV inside, so I was being polite. And the only person in the world who could make me cry in an instant decided to flip the fuck out on me, while I was at Joo's house. So of coarse Harry had came out too see what was wrong. I was sitting by the tiki-tourches that me and Dan had set up and  I was all like, im not going to let it get to me, Ima keep it all bottled up, but I think I had been doing that for too long because as soon as he went to give me a hug, I lost it. That's the first time I really ever let anyone see me cry, let alone comfort me. I'm really glad they were there though. Because if they werent, who knows what might of happened. So then, we went inside after like a half hour of crying and comforting, and then me bob and harry all sat down and talked for a while, which helped so freaking much. I never knew people actually cared about me. They were all worried. Why? I didn't think that I could mean anything to anybody. I guess I do. Learn something new everyday don't we? Yeah. Yesterday was quite the rollercoaster ride of emotions and events. Eep! I'll prolly end up writing later, if the mother and father arn't yelling at each other again, which I have a feeling they will, just because, they shouldn't be in the same room together. Someone save me..
I don't know what i'm doing anymore. I really like him, I mean I really do, but am I just kidding myself? Is it actually capeable that the kid I like, likes me just the same, but also has the same mentality as i do when it comes to getting up the guts to making the first step? Could it honestly be possible?  You know, tomarrow is the last day of school. And it doesnt feel like it. At all. It feels like the middle of the year. On top of that, things have been happening, and shiz has been going down that make me want to explode. Why I constantly put up with it all is literally beyond me. I bet you anyone else in my shoes would of had a nervous break down by now.  I might loose a brother, that I never really got to know. Yeah, cuz the dummy signed up for the army a few years ago, and when Lilly came along, they put him in the reserves. Dont you know that the reserves are being called out? His group has already been activated. That scares the crap out of me. I don't want him to go. He has a kid he has to raise. He's got me, his only sister and brothers to be around. It's all too much.  And I still have one more final to go. People make too much out of nothing, and some don't make enough out of anything. This worlds a crazy place, and my mind has decided to run at it's own pace. Why can't I be the one as the center of attention?  It's not fair for me to have to fight for everything, when I've got nothing to show. Am I not fighting hard enough? Or am I just going to be alone for the rest of my life? I don't care anymore. At all. I don't fucking care.  You people don't care about what you put me through, you don't care about what I'm put through, you don't care at all. So you know what, it's time for a change.
Interessant.  Today was the first day of finals. Whoopty-Doo. I finished my Algebra, and took the first part of my french today. It was alright. Easier than I thought. Which is good. I'm definitly not complaining. After, I left and met up with Chris and Harry at the gazeebo, sat around for a while there. Then, chris left and we decided that we were going to go and kidnap Dan. So, we went and sat under the big tree in the practice field and read, it was soo nice out! Then we commandeered him, went to Joe's, had a water fight, on a trampoline, and then I came home.   I only wished.   You know, I wish that I would have more guts, too get up the nerve sometime. It never happens. I don't think he will ever either. But if he really wants something to begin between us, I'm hoping he would say something.  Tomarrows a long day, I have Science Final, 2nd part of Francaise, and English. Yay! .. not. I get out after 2nd period on Thursday though! Last day of school! w00t!

Yeah, I went and saw it with the gentlemen today. That was great. We went to the mall before for a while, walked over to the theater, and then we all recriuted back to Bob's house after.  The movie had some very nicely done effects and fight scenes. A few dry spots, and some questionable things. Like, where does his web shoot too, when theres nothing around him? - Confusing? I know.  Not sure what I'm doing tomarrow. I'm sure I'll be wherever they are though. Wanna know something? I don't think that I have ever been home one day completly this summer. That's okay though. I love spending time with them. Even when there's nothing to do and we just sit there making up stupid stuff. That's the best.  I hope I get some sort of a response from him soon. I'm so nervous and so confused all at the same time. But hey, that's okay. Maybe it's a good thing he's thinking about it. So, I'm not quite complaining just yet.  Well, even though I have nothing to do, I'm gonna go. I'm tired.   - I'll probably write in here laterz!
Song: 'Yo, Check out my ride.' - The Aquabats Mood: Oak - kay.   I figured that since I had a blog, and it was really depressing evertime I would go to write in it, I would make a new blog, that would be happy! So here it goes..  Yeah, since I didnt get much sleep Friday night, because we decided to be stupid and stay up all night, and I didn't go to bed last night until 3, I was so freaking tired today. Plus, Dad woke me up at 9:45 to go to breakfast with Aunt Kat, Uncle Tom and Grandpa. That was fun. I got to drive home too so that was cool. Then I went shopping with Dad for a while, after that I went to Joe's house and met up with him, Harry and Ryan. I was hoping Dan would be there, since I need to conversize with him. But he wasnt. So Yeah. I have nothing to really say since this isn't a bad mood blogger.  haha.   I'll writecha latah!
Wow, I' m so proud of the Blogger people.    They've finally let us edit how we want our font to look. And to that I'll applaude them.    Last night I went out to eat with the family, and the Aunt and Uncleness. That was great fun.    Made me sad that I couldn't watch any of my videos last night since they lack the capeablities of DSL. I would hate the be them.    I went to the movies none the less today though. Went and saw 'Mean Girls.' It was actually a very good movie. It really shows the truths of teenage labling, and things like that. Though at some points it was quite exaggerated, but I think the whole point of films of that mannor, would be to make it dramatic.    I started to read, 'Brave New World,' by Huxley. Very good. It makes you think, yes I mean MAKES! Because in the book you have to learn everything that is going on. Since it is about genomes, stem cell cloning and human harvesting, and it was written in 1932.    Almost sad is what it is. I mean, we just cloned the first human being last year, but a single man wrote a whole novel on it, basically explaining the process back in the thirties.    I also (finally) picked up the book, 'Rule by Secrecy,' by Jim Marrs. I was so excited. I've wanted to sit down and read that book for a while now. It's basically about conspiracies, diffrent groups, truths about mass media, and things of that mannor.    It will be a good read.    Marching band starts in almost a week, more like eight days, and my Muse concert is in 18 days. So freaking excited. Its going to be the highlight of my summer by far.    Oh well. I guess that's all I have to say for now. Maybe i'll write later. Not sure though.
Music: Darude - 'Sandstorm' vs. Robert Miles - 'Children'   I didn't do anything today.   Some stuff that people said made me rethink everything. I hate when that happens.  Nobody ever comments in this thing.  Besides Cups, so to you, I thank.  I miss talking to a few people. I'm glad I started to talk to a few again.  So I'm going to go.
Music: Muse - 'Falling Away With You'   I was talking to a couple of old friends today.  I hurd them talk about what they did yesterday, about how they get up and go to church every Sunday morning. How bizzare.  Ideas like that are just bizzare to me.  How can so many people have that much dedication to one thing, for so long?  Now, I can understand having dedication in something like that if it was say, marraige, school something along those lines but with that, it's always something new, bold and interesting.  Doesn't the church feed you the same stories that you've probably hurd since you we're a child?  I'm sorry, but repeditiveness is one of my ultimate pet peeves.   I don't exactly write off the theory of a 'greater power,' so to say, but I can't agree with something that can't give me explanation and facts. I'd rather have nothing to believe in than believe in something I can't rely on and prove.   The other thought, is the thought of having someone have control of your life. I know that you say 'he doesn't control it, he just gives you options.' To me it sounds too much like a buisness. And I don't want someone else to have control of anything. I've always been told, 'I'm my own person, no one can dictate me.' So I'd sure as hell like to live it that way.   Another thing, not too far off subject, but not exactly about the 'Evolution,' objection and what not, is the question of the end of the world.  The Apocalypse as it where.   Have you ever woken up, in the middle of the night, when it's pitch black, and not realizing it's only 3-ish and you thought the world was over? What would you do in the last few moments? For the brief moment of confusion, I get paniced. I realized that I haven't said half of the things I wish I would of, and that I haven't did half the things I would of liked to. But I know that in the few moments left, I could'nt get half of those accomplished. Thus, feeling regret, and sorrow. I think that's what scares me.   I'm not scared of the Apocalypse or dying for that fact. I'm scared of not doing the things I need to do, or say the things I need to say.   Thats enough of my deep thoughts for you, for now.  I'm sure I'll be back later with more.
Music: 'Zanzibar' - Suburban Legends         'Falling without you' - Muse So.  Today wasn't so grand.  I found out that laying down on my floor, and setting the fan right in front of me on high, with all the lights off and curtians closed, listening to Muse is very relaxing. I spent most of my day doing that today. Tomarrow, I'm gonna head up to the Grove City Outlets, and do some shopping with the auntness. That should be fun.  Im so bored, and tired of this vacation crap.  I just want school to start up again. That way I don't have days like these where I just sit around and do absolutly nothing. Besides think.
Ugh.  Today was a boring day. Little to do.  All I've done, was walk down to Harry's, where I stayed for maybe three hours and watched them play Kingdom Hearts. A beautifully made game (art wise) but a bore to sit and watch. So I left.  Still no word.  That kind of thing irritates me.  But oh well. We all can't be choosers, now can we?  Or just not me.  If I find more to detail you about, I'll make sure to write later. But don't get to hopefull.
Haven't done anything today. Yeah, I sat around infront of the pc and wrote somethings. Rather than that and cleaning up the house a bit I've just been here.  Todays an oddish day.  Hopefully this feeling will pass by tomarrow. If it doesn't then I'll probably be worse off. I'm still extremly excited about seeing Muse, live in 27 days! That's going to be the highlight of the year by far. Especially, since it's a festivle, they most likley have a meet and greet tent out. Meaning I get to meet him. But enough of that.  'Everything that happens is supposed to be, and it's all predetermined, can't change your destiny, guess I'll just keep moving so they may be, and one day I may get to where I'm going..' - 'Nothing Gets Crossed Out' - Bright Eyes
Well I spent the night over at Harry's house last night with the gentlemen. Didn't do much, played videogames, DDR, watched some anime. That was about it. Though we did walk to chinese earlier, so that was good fun. I still have no word about that letter. No one has. Kind of upsets me, but there are signs of hope.  Since Sarah had to pull out on me for Warped Tour, it's gonna be just me and pops at the annual summer concert of the year. And because he still has back troubles, he asked me if I could look at another show. So I found one. A damn good one at that. I found the Curosia Festivle with -The Cure -MUSE! -Thursday -Auf Der Maur! -Interpool -The Rapture -Mogwai -The Cooper Temple Clause.  That means, me..live and in the flesh, get to watch, and meet,  (because I will NOT leave that show without meeting him) Matthew Bellamy play infront of my very eyes! Holy Crap! That will be so freaking amazing, I might just die. He's my ideal guitar-master, and has the BEST voice I have ever hurd..out of all of the other amazing singers like, Ace Enders, Brandon Boyd, and Matt Smasher. Matthew tops them all.  Its going to be like woah. But the tix are expensive. So hopefully that will be a striking iniciative for Dad to help me in my persue of meeting him. Like I said. I won't leave until I have an autograph and a picture! hehe. It's only fair tho! At this point, I don't care about not going to Warped. So for those who were maybe looking at going with me, sorry, but Muse is definitly worth it to blow off warped for.
Well today was a fun, but long day! Came home from Aunt Kat's house around 9:30 this morning, got changed, then Rachelness came and picked me up at a little after 10. Went to Mary's house, got party supplies, opened my present (Thanks ladies!) then we coo-bye-yah-ed down to Jenna's and started setting up in her cabin. Made many trips back and fourth. Yeah.  She was so surprised, and the cabin looked cool! Hehe, we dressed up in her little sisters play clothes, that were like, sparkley non fitting items, and went to the movie store and Pizza Hut, waved to people and got some interesting looks. O yeah, and she's getting an underground pool, oh my goodness, she has some nice looking workers! (The shell necklace guy!!)  Yea, over all between the eating of icing, the cake..me almost getting killed by Rachel, and humiliating myself in front of people..it was a good day. Catch you on the DL!!
I woke up to the 'rents fighting. Then Aunt Kathy called and rescued me to her house.  Mom followed. > I swam with Emma and Noah for 6 hours.  I think I have chlorine poisoning because I don't feel good and my ears hurt. I came home, and they faught some more. So I sat in my room listing to Muse for a few hours. Then ventured out into the living room to go online.  I don't know where mom is.  Hm.  Tomarrow will probably be quite interesting.
Goodness! I have had nothing to do, this whole day. Seriously, I went online for a few hours, called Bob, because all of the gentlemen were over there and found out that they were all leaving in a little bit anywho. So I stayed home the whole dang day. Fell asleep though around 2:45 until almost 6. I was quite sleepy. I'm really hoping that tomarrow will be better. But who knows what everyone is doing.  As of now I'm going to Warped Tour with just my Dad, which will suck for him, because I go into the pits, and I don't think he can. Meaning I'll have to leave him alone for most of the time that were there. That is so going to be boring for him. Maybe I can find someone to tag along. Because Sarah was supposed to go with me, until she found out she has driving and danceline that day. So I'm going alone.  Marching band starts in less than a month. 26 days to be exact. Oh, joy.  I'm guessing that I'll type more tonight. The boredom is effecting my communication skills. Ba.
Okay,  so I found the magical wonders of xanga, and I must say, they've won me over. But I know some of you kids out there read this thing, so for the hell of it, I'll update.  So Cups, this one's for you. I think I'll start by giving you the expo on wensday, since it was rad and I heart it.  We left the house at 3:30 and go there at almost exactly 5. It was down at Blossom which was really nice. Then I found out I couldn't of taken in my camera because they don't allow it. And because it was pouring we had to take raincoats. (Yeah, it stopped raining about 20 mins afer we got in.) Then we watched Auf Der Maur. The lead, Melissa is the ex-bassist for the Smashing Pumpkins. Who,  in her age still rocked like a mother. I couldn't believe how rad she was. She is now my vanilla!  Then we watched Thursday, who is amazing live. Didn't expect that great of a job by them at all. Plus it was the last day of the tour for them, and they we're filming a rock movie called 'God's Lot,' (btw, second stage was in a parking lot.) After that (when everyone else left for a while) I stopped by and talked to him, Geoff, (lead of Thursday) for a good half hour. He's such a sweetheart, it's great how he listened to me. I wish I had more people like that around me more often. Gave me some good words of wisdom. Then came Muse. Oh dear dear me. I was so bloddy excited for them to come out. Okay so the stage wasn't more than the width of a classroom. Maybe a tad bit more. And where I was standing I was right on the baracade, and I was in front of Matt. Who I could easily drool over, let alone sweaty and with a rad guitar.  So they played, Hysteria, New Born, Butterflies and Hurricanes, The Small Print and Stockholm Syndrome. I was a bit dissapointed because I didn't get to hear 'Plug in Baby,' so what I did, was I yelled it really loud, as they were still on stage, and then the group of about 10 forigners screamed out was sounded like, 'Ploog En Bah-bay' but it was just there accent. It was still great. So they stopped, looked at each other, and came back on, and played it. I was so happy. Oh yeah, after Stockholm Syndrome, and after the riff thing they played after,  Matt was on the ground right in front of me, so when he stood up he was like, 'hugs for everyone,' and so I gave him a big hug, and kissed him on the cheek! (you only live once right?) and then he looked down at me, and was like, 'alright then,' and gave me a kiss back! I thought I was going to die. but I didn't! Then we decided to catch The Cure, who by all means suck live. Its like all stoner/elevator music. Horrible. So we left after the first 2 or 3 songs. It was like, 10:30 by the time we got out, and we wanted dinner, so we went to Denny's where we ended up running into Melissa from Auf Der Maur, talked to her for like 10 mins. then ate, and came home. Sound great? Yes! It was!
Well I'm not sure what a Blog is and so this will be me figuring it out as I go.  LOL of all things I'm in a pretty crappy mood tonight too.  Joy.  I have lots I should be journaling about and I guess I might as well work on it here.  I used to have an Open Diary, a site that is still near and dear to my heart.  But that got compromised by someone and I took it down and then never had the umphf to start over.  Whats on my mind tonight.  Who knows.  Well what WAS on my mind this morning at work was this.  He spent the night last night.  That was cool, always is very nice to be in his arms.  To be aware of his warmth all night.  I actually didn't sleep much last night.  Told him this morning that I didn't know why but I do know.  I may only have 4 more weeks with him.  4 more weeks to last my lifetime of having someone hold me and love me for no reason, just because they do.  He holds me...all day sometimes.  I love the morning light shining on his face as he wakes next to me....his blue eyes gazing back at me with his soft smile.    Lying in the darkness, just before sleep sometimes he tells me things.  Last week he drifted off in my arms and when I had to leave he woke and told me he knew he was falling.  And I said I know.  I held him for longer before I finally had to leave.  The other night we were sleeping and he sat up in the night...sort of upset or sad.  He said baby i just don't want to lose you.  And I said so don't and held him and he fell back to sleep with me.  It's like his fears and heart show in the dark of night.  And I know because mine do too.  When we drank cider the other night...things started to be said that we feel...and are afraid to say.  I still can't say it so much in words.  I want to and I miss him so much tonight it aches.  But early this morning...before the sun rose, I looked over at him and he reached for me in his sleep and held me close to his chest.  Said I love you baby.  I said I love you too...then I held him so tight....so much it hurt because I ache for him, ache to tell him what's in my heart.  Ache to be with him and really give all of me to him.  It's ripping me open that in a month or so it may be over.  Maybe not...but what if.  What if it all changes...we go apart...  I know we can live through that...but that's not the point.  I can't spend my life wondering what would have been if we had given this a real go.  In my dreams I want to share a home, to have him come home for dinner at night and to wake with him every day.  I want to play our games and watch our movies and have our friends.  I want to see what our babies would look like and take them places.  To make pictures of us that match the dreams in my heart.  How could I have known that he would be so much so soon and that I would never want to let him go.    I think I'll stop with that cuz I don't wanna talk about what I don't wanna talk about anyhoo.
I awoke this morning in a foul mood.  Why??  I don't really know.  I had become a little testy on the phone with my girlfriend last night but not enough to justify it carrying over to the next day.  One thing I do know is it is setting the precedence for the rest of the day, which isn't really surprising as once I get in a foul mood it is extremely hard to pull myself up out of the trenches of self loathing and hatred.  I've been at work for the last 4 hours and have thus far accomplished nothing, at least a lot more nothing then what I usually accomplish while at work.  In recent times I have slipped from a model employee to the try to do as little as possible disgruntle employee, reason being my boss recently hired a new employee and our office is turning into a good ole boys club where I being of the opposite sex feel out of place.  I work at a university and have worked in the same department for the past four years, my official job title is Computer Support Assistant yet my responsibilities have grown much since I started gainful employment here.  Yet now Iâm feeling under appreciated as the new guy is getting paid more than me and is perhaps destined, in the near future, for a pay rise, just to stick the knife in a little deeper.    You could argue that his job title carries more clout then mine as he is officially known as a Web Developer, yet I as a lowly old Computer Support Assistant should technically be paid less, yet it appears that I have moved from the illustrious realm of shit kicker to web developer over the years, yet I still kick the shit when ever someone is in.  Technically we should be on an equal playing field, yet this too doesnât seem to be the case.  Because I have been here the longest I am given the added responsibility of maintaining our servers while my boss lays on a beach somewhere smelling of coconut oil and slowly burning flesh.   But alas it is not to be, I must suffer in silence, I know Iâve not been very silent.  I do however feel much better now after this little venture, perhaps my foul mood was simply due to pent up frustrations which have since subsided as a result of this writing.  I feel better now and perhaps well enough to do some real work.
wowwwza fer real i have just been happy lately. like theres nothing to bring a girl down, well a few, but like honestly, my life is amazing riot nio. for example, yesterday i worked with jim, and hes just really nice and i love that kid. then i could drive home cuz my parents were so thoughtful as to give me my liscence back. then me tess mart and clarr warched one of the worlds best movies : dickie roberts: former child star. and something as simple as playing a few games b4 bed just made the night complete. i went to bed happy and woke up in the night laughing b/c sarah started screaming things in her sleep waking us all up. then in the mooonin i ate pop tarts, which was a positive, but the best part was emma was doing all of her dances for us and hannah was attempting them too. it was hillarious. and then we hit shady izzoak. it just was one of the best spans of times EVER.  u know what i was thinking about tho, just to go deep for a sec. having a boyfriend or a girl friend is so WIERD. like think about it. you pour your heart aout to one person, and say all these things, and do little cute things for them like go to their games or buy them presents, or suprise them somewhere. but then like, when youre 'done' with them and move on to the next person, you do it all again, and its all the SAME. like, you end up saying that same nice things, and going to the same games, only for a differnt person. like why does it mean anything any more. or why do ppl not get offended when someone askes them out. i do. so the next time that a guy askes me out im going to start crying and ask them why they dont care about me. but seriously think about that. it makes you wonder the significance of your relationships.   gatta eat and then coach, wish my sistas team luck.  ~~monroe
k well last night was one of the funnest nights in a while. we took care of business on jenny's tramp, and we watched a few quality movies such as hollow man, memento and small portion or rats. we had one mass CO-ED sleepover which is just a positive step in a whole new direction. but the guys were just to 'with it'when we played chuck or fuck, but they're new...i guess u could say. also avital sang a few songs which were amazing, on the flip-side, she woke up the entire house at 5 in da mooonin. but honestly it was fun. next step: sleeping in the shaggin. it will happen, im calling it.   oh and david wilkinson you owe me two dollars and do not deny it. u happen to make the same bet twice and, yes, you lost so PAY UP. oh and u spelled ur own name wrong in sarahs yearbook from way back in the day. ur spelled ur name wilkonson. (poor kid) ahem...  ok, i really dont know what to say, im so conflicting. a part of me really wants to just blow up and write this nasty blog about something that happened. because i felt like i was about to throw up for about..mm..a couple hours last night. like i try to tell myself that i dont care, and its not a big deal and to move on, and like ive been trying to psyche myself out for like the past few weeks but i guess im not doing a good enough job. but like it really ISNT that big of a deal and i dont even know why im wasting ppls time writing this. i think its not that big of a deal to me until im really there caought up in it, then it means the world to me. aaah. i hafta go  im helping coach my dads soccer team baby  ttyl
i forgot a crutial part of my day. now i want you to honestly say it out loud, just cuz its fun. The cap. words are the words with the accent in the sentece. its just cool cuz it kinda changes what they sentence means. say it with me: I will see you in the morning. i WILL see you in the morning. i will SEE you in the morning. i will see YOU in the morning. i will see you IN the morning. i will see you in THE morning. i will see you in the MORNING.   thanks guys that was fun ill see you in the morning
well lets see. 2day i visited augsburg, played nintendo with quaile and buyas, i worked with yossi and jamie, hmm and hung out with the jew kids. it was a hot one. soo hot. want to touch..nvm. oh and CLAIRE BROKE HER PHONE. lets see. she made it about....45 minutes with that phone. i got it. lets all pitch in some money and buy her ONE of those clips (the one that attaches the mitten to your jacket sleeve) and clip one end to her phone and the other to her FACE. now that thats settled..  the shaggin last night was a GROOD...i mean great...and good... great and good... time, david did manage cover his face in wax. Typical david forgot that the candles would eventually overflow with wax, and he was lying on the floor under one of the corner-shelves and all the wax flowed off the shelf on to his face. it was a beautiful thing. oh and we did have a HARD CORE card fight, and yes i took every one with authority. especially clay. poor kid. but honestly the shaggy waggy looks emaculate, everyone should check it out, and david would like the company. it would give him something to do other then make out with his sister.   moving on  i have the thought of the blog. ok. lets say u have a friend or a lover or someone who talks about a past person. like a friend talking about an old friend or a lover talking about an old lover. and they talk so, like, lovingly about them. and like how they miss them so much or like they were devistated that they couldnt see each other cuz they moved, died, or broke up or something. ok. well do ever wonder if they are thinking like that about you? like so u arnt frinds with someone ne more, or like arnt dating someone ne more, do u think that they are having those same feelings about you? like are they upset cuz they cant be with u ne more? or was that one person they were talking about just amazingly special to them and u dont mean nething to them, and they havnt thought about you since. see that bothers me. i guess that whole paragraph was saying that i wish that i knew if ppl were thinking about me the way they thought about other ppl or like im thinking about them. like if i meant ne thing to them. cuz maybe i thought of them as a best friend, but they only thought of me as someone to hang out with when they were bored......  well its 1 in the morning and i should be hittin the sack. i am going to Bethel tmrw, im leaving at like 130, call me if u wanna hit that with me.   night  *alison
hewlow  alright well big news about the shaggin almost being done, it does look hot, ill admit that.   umm survive it and drive it just finished about an hour ago, it it was STUPID. they gave both of them cars b/c neither of them were going to stop. see that just ruins the fun but w/e floats ur boat. they did go around about 1500 times, and really thats sick.   if ne one wants to come to colleges with me, hit me up cuz im getting lonley. im going to gustavus this morning, im going to one tmrw and 2 on friday. oh and COME AND VISIT ME WHEN IM WORKGING 2NITE AND TMRW 4-9.   ok so the feeling of the blog. this random feeling that was pissing me off is the 'sudden not caring' feeling. dadaadadaa. idk if ne one u have felt that, but i bet that u have. its like u think that someone really cares about you or something that ur doing, and then when ur done then they just kinda...stop caring...and u wonder if they really cared that much earlier or if they were just kinda doing it b/c they had to, like if u guys were dating. or if...uumm...uu..were..bbsitting someone..hmm. and that just sucks and makes u just feel not cool.   but its okay, ive found things in my life to make up for it, for example, claires car. i have NEVER been sad when im in claires car, she always has a happy mix, or good things happen in thurr. so moral of the 10 second story :if ur in a pissy mood hit up claires car.   alrrrizzite, gatta bounce beyatch  donde esta la biblioteca Pedro?  *~aya~*
ok so this one is going to be dedicated to lying becuase i think that its a problem that has infested ppl lately and it is just not cool. im not saying that everyone lies xcept for me b/c i do it too. but i just want to say that a lot of the lying that is going on right now is really hurting ppl, for example a witnessed a lie that took place about 20 minutes ago and if it were me on the other end i probably would have cried. like ditching ppl isnt cool. ill just leave it at that. and i just want to give a should out to the ppl who build on other lies : someone is ALWAYS going to find out no matter what. anf it is only going to get worse. there is no way to live a lie for your ENTIRE life, b/c eventually its going to come up again and its only going to be 10x worse then. so just stop being stupid and just admit what u need to say, or be mature and talk about it. b/c if ur lying ur obviously trying to cover something up, which really should be talked about. were all mature ppl here so, like if were me, i would have so much more respect for you if u actually laid it all out for me, and i would realize that u are being the bigger person and in the end i would later thank you for that. so thats a HINT for all those ppl out there u are NOT TALKING TO BE BECAUSE ITS REALLY BOTHERING ME BECAUSE NOT TALKING TO SOMEONE ABOUT IT IS AS BAD AS LYING ABOUT IT. its not any different.   im sorry im just in a bad mood right now b/c so many ppl lied to me tonight, are lying to mo over a spread out amount of time, or are lying to eachtoher. aye aye aye  im not sure if u would understand, but go to jason mraz's website and it explains it very well, but seriously guys, THE BOYS GONE HOME  oh and we died claires hair today, its like a light strawberry blonde, it looks good. hit me up if u want ur hair died.   sorry guys al
WELL i have a lot say considering i havent blogged since the day b4 the euro exam. but i decided to start over with a new blog and like vow to blog eaerry day. (every day).  tonight was a good night, we went over to alainers and we just partayyed it up like no other, it was a lot better then sitting in the wendys parking lot for the entire night, ill let u know that one from some past experience...OH and today was good. WE RE-DID THE FRIGGEN SHAGGIN!!. there are no words to describe what we did to it,but it just looks amazing, ill tell u that much. and its going to bet better once we put in the shelves and like put that gold shia all over it. this day would have been the best day ever except for the fact that davids mom SPAZZED on us because there was a few rolls of TP in his trees and he was to spoiled to clean it up, but im going to put that behind me and move on. but guys remember, 'if u do it again you are no longer welcome in our house'  i was talking to byers about 1/2 hour ago about this, and he told me to blog so here it is...be excited. ok well im saying that ppl make it really hard to figure things out. like things never work out the way they should in the first place, and then once they get screwed up other ppl who dont really know what they are talking about make it so much harder to fix. rumors get started, ppl talk behind other ppls backs and ppl shoot other people. im sure ur all thinking about a specific situation that is going on right now, and thats not what im talking about, im just talking about problems in general. like if things just went bad and only the people who were involved knew about it then it would be so much easier to fix. but dont get me wrong, not all situations. like if ur getting stalked by a crazy old lady wearing over-all shorts that likes to go walking at 2 in the morning then PLEASE talk to the police or something. but like about all the 'drama'that happens. i think that we should all be like buddah and let it flow. nothing matters b/c whats happened has happened and u cant do ne thing to change that. also u cannot change how ppl are feeling b/c if ur changing ne thing, its not what they want..because ur CHANGING it. i hope u catch my flow. that rule of thumb also goes for the ppl that are involved with it b/c trust me, youre going to waste a lot of time for nothing b/c no matter how hard u try its still going to be what u dont want. yes i am the UNIVERAL BUBBLE BREAKER but i needed to slap u in the face and make sure u knew that b4 u wound up in that situation. IM JUST LOOKING OUT FOR YOU because i love you, i love you all. (except for david because he called me fat and then made his mom yell at me)  and if u dont listen to me and end up being screwed, hit up either me or mart for the top 10 bible verses to know that we got, they really help for like every situation. no joke.  ok well, im sorry if that first blog dissapointed you, but there are many more to come.   goodnight everyone, and as the amazing alex byers says '2morrow is a new day'  love that guy   ehhhwwley

URGH
'OOH! KEVIN G!
i have many things that i have been thinking about lately.&nbsp;  one being why its so easy to say that u dont care about someone when youre not around them, but then when ur with them u take it all back? or its so easy to say that u hate someone or that u just want to never see them again, but then when u see them u would kill for them to even talk to you? two being why is it that when u have no authority or right over a person you still feel like that are yours? like u know that u have no reason to, but u get insanely jealous when someone else is with them and hes not giving his attention to you? and u cant tell anyone because u have no reason to be feeling those feelings because hes not 'urs'. like why is it such a big deal when u see him later laughing with someone else, or when he casually puts his hand on someones hip, just in a friendship way.  why is it that in a realtionship one person can love someone with all their heart and soul, but the other person doesnt even mind that much when the relationship is finished? like it doesnt make sense. also do u think that it is possible that every one has someone out there in the world for them, but when u find them, maybe ur not the person for them? their person is still out there. like is it possible to find someone that ur meant to be&nbsp;with, and&nbsp;love so much that u could never love anyone greater, but then that person isnt meant to be with you?  &nbsp; i hate thinking about things like that. me and tess just kinda got on some of those topics, and my mind was still flowin, so i had to blog. if u have the simple answer to any of those q's....just email them to me.  &nbsp; me and rowdy are working together tonight, 4-cl, come and visit us &nbsp; striz
well as u all have probably guessed by the title of this blog i am having a co-ed sleepover with the universally loved alex byers. he apparently 'doesnt want to sleep by himself in his house' so my dad was like 'well theres an aero mat in the basement' and that was that.  &nbsp; right now were just chillin, and its just cool...because its cool. lets see. today i went to the cross-town club with sarah, and then i rollebladed around the lake by myself cuz sarah wussed out. then me and tess went to byers' house b/c there were about 40 cars outside and his door was open. but really no one was inside and he had just stupidly left the door open. me and sarah like snuck all in thinking that they were like hiding from us too, but really... no one was home. then later me tess c-dub byers and clay chilled in the long lot. no joke. and then byers is sleeping over. its been a grand day. &nbsp; &nbsp; have u ever experienced i time when someone is talking to u about a time that u two had together but u dont remember it and u think that the other person dreamed it. like u know that it was a dream and its just really funny? well that just happened to me. ill just share that great experience with you all: mattgoneWild04: make sure to bring those sexy pajamas, the ones i love, those sexy sweats. HcKYcHiCA06: hah what. what sexy sweats? mattgoneWild04: u know damn well, remember when we went to ur house and then u went to change and then u changed into those sweats and u looked super fine assed in em HcKYcHiCA06: i think that was a dream mattgoneWild04:u changed into gray sweats wit sumin written on the butt, and a dark burgandy red shirt HcKYcHiCA06: i dont own pants liek that, im sorry man it was a dream mattgoneWild04: no way i hate u so much, ally, it was so sexy. u have to remember, and bring them to camp HcKYcHiCA06: im sorry&nbsp; and it just went on for a while. lol  &nbsp; well that about wraps it up, im going to the driving range tmrw. it will be a grand time. peace&nbsp; &nbsp; aballaby &nbsp; 'u want to come to the pants party?' 'are u asking me if&nbsp;i want to come to a party in your pants?' '....yes' ~~anchormizzan~~
ok&nbsp;so i realized last night how mean ppl are to each other. like its not a lot to where ppl notice that much, but when you sit back and look at it, people are just plane mean to each other. i also noticed last night how nice clarsky dub is. i think that we should all just take a leaf outa her book and just try to step it up in the niceness scale, myself included. and we shoudl give her an award.  &nbsp; wow im excited for 2nite, theres a rumor that a bus-full of ppl are going to grand slam, and thad be wicked awsome. i havent been there yet, ever.  &nbsp; greatest 2 moments of my life yesterday: *getting off of work at 930 when i started at 2 *listening to a mix in byers' car from the summer b4 7th grade &nbsp; it was hot &nbsp; well i gatta go to work, come visit me, were open til 7 &nbsp; ewl
hewlow. it feels like it has been a hella long time since i blogged. or blogged about anything of importance. ya the 2nd one.   right now i have my friend over brittany, shes my moms best friends daughter, but now her and my sister and her friend carrie hoppman are playing mario cart, and i got shafted.   man i had fun last night. me tess claire clay travis dave and byers had a tramp party and we all watched claire jump retardidly (i dont know why she looks so funny haha). but travid protected me and others in his boobs, which are massive. we climbed into his cleavage. it was a good time.   no but so everyone leaves to go home and likei SWEAR that i had my phone. but then i went inside and i couldnt find it later. so i assumed that i left it out on the tramp. i went out there..and it wasnt there. so i went back and got a flashlight and looked on the ground for about 20 MINUTES and couldnt find it. then i went inside and gutted my room incase i threw it in there and guess what? I DIDNT FIND IT! so i went to bed thinking that my phone was ont he ground outside getting all full of water and morning dew, and then i had a few nightmares, and then claire called me saying that she took my phone home in her purse. it was a beautiful thing. thanks claire for making me one hour deprived of sleep. jk  i love this SAT class, its full of 12 hot junior guys  i want to announce to the world that i have overcome a large barrier in my life, as of yesterday. and it feels good. it took a lot of cold pricklies to make it happen, but i got 'er done.   wewell i hafta go play nintendo..peace  holla  'I DONT KNOW WHY WE ARE YELLING!!...LOUD NOISES!!' ~ the best movie ever   ****striz
ATTENTION!! this goes out for YOU!...seriously  Theres something bout the way you look tonight, Theres something bout the way that i can't take my eyes off you. Theres something bout the way your lips invite, maybe its the way that i get nervous when your around. And I want you to be mine  Theres something bout how you stay on my mind, theres something bout the way that I whisper your name when I'm asleep Oh no. Maybe its the look you get in your eyes. Oh baby its the way that makes me feel to see you smile. And the reasons they may change but what i'm feeling stays the same.  urgh. ~a tired and sad ally~
its been a while...member that song? no fer real its been like a week and a lot of shia has gone down. lets have a large and in charge replay: right b4 i left claire and byers were at my house playing board games and reading about how mary-kate is addicted to drugs until like 1215, and then i still had to finish packing. then about 10 minutes later i had to be at the ariport at 6 in the morning to catch a plane to Mass for a hockey camp.  day1: it was tight cuz we just kinda chilled at our coaches house and ate a lot of food and watched van wilder. great..yet sick movie. and we got our hotel room and got all settled and shtuff. day2: we were woken up at 615 for breakfast and like an orientation that me and brando were late to cuz we were buying little toy boys lacrosse sticks. they were a necessity. then we got our clothes that we had to wear ALWAYS and then we skated edges and stuff and split us ito groups. i guess by watching you skate on your ourside and inside edges they can tell how good you are at hockey..and i got shafted cuz i haddnt skated in 2 months. but it was fly. then after skating we had plyometrics--if u dont know what those are just think jumping...lots of jumping. after that i dont really remember exactly what we did but somewhere in there we skated 3 more times and had 3 more drylands b4 being shipped back to the hotel at 930.  day3: it was our first real day and it was the longest day of my life. i was amazingly sore from the day before and honestly couldnt walk. but regardess we had 4 killer hours of skating with a wicked long run in the woods by the arena in the rain. like it wouldnt have been that bad but then we ran by the steepest hill that u have ever seen and our coach made us slide down it. little did we know that we were going to sprit up that beyatch thousands of times until this 14 year-old like collapsed on the hill and then we dicided it was time for us to run all the way back. i pretty much died. after that it all blurred together. day4: 2nd real day, and at this point i was so sore that when i tried to get out of bed my legs gave out. it was a horrible experience. but it was worse trying to put my pants on b/c TO SAVE MY LIFE i could not pick up my leg to put them on. so i ended up sitting on the bed and using my ARMS to pick up my own leg. also the highlight of this day were the slide boards. if u dont know what they are they are like a sheet of plexi-glass that u slide across with little booties on. it seems fun but its not. i reached a point that i had never reached before. at a point my legs gave out at the end and honestly i could not get up. like i REALLY couldnt. im lying on this plastic sheet in a puddle of my own sweat trying to use my arms to lift myself up and at that same time about 130 coaches and councelors surround me and are screaming at me to get up and are like hitting the walls and floors and im just wiggin out. i thouhg i was dying. i think i was becase i dont remember ne more. xcept that we skated for the same 4 hours and had thesame drylands. oh we did have the stabillity balls for one dryland which i got a kick out of. that was a highlight.  day5: our last real day. it was just like the onthers xcept for that we had a scrimmage for our last our of skating. and and durring the day we had this like crazy kickboxing thing. the lady who ran it was the beastiest ladies i have ever seen. she was REALLY into the whole thing. and it was wicked tired after it, it was 2 strait hours of lots oj jumping and football running and punching air. it was funny cuz everytime we did just a normal jab we had to say the person we were imagining that we were punching. it was a good time. i bet u are all wondering who i was punching. lol. annnnywayy day6: this day all i can say is parachutes. and mine was HUGE. talk about pulling the groin muscles. ouch. still cant walk right. but that was about it.  oh and i met some really cool ppl there. ill just tell u the ones that reminded me of ppl here: -this girl names leah who was the spitten image of meg, ben carlsons older sister - i swear this girl could have been brandon b's sister - this coach who was an older adam galililiililii...hmm and the cool ppl were the one girl that was called corey that i thouht was a guy for a while and my roomate called gardner, but with a boston accent it was gaadnaa. ** and i heard the song coolo about 20 times along wiht freak-a-leak. it was tight as hell.   well this is a wicked long blog just about camp, i think that ill come back tmrw after church and blog fer real. night all  *~minnesota~* (that was my name at camp??, along with strick)
i just got home a little bit ago, and im glad that i did. im just in a damn good mood right now. ill just give u the good day run thru right quick: *woke up at 1030  *byers picked me up at 11 15 and we went to the twins game. we did happen to miss the only scoring of the game, but it was okay because byers made up for it by buying a foot long beast of a hotdog. and he purchased my ticket. twas a grand ole time  *went to work and had the best time i have ever had there. me and yossi had some deep convos, and i dont think that i have ever laughed so hard. when we get fruit its put in this huge plastic bin-thing and put in the freezer for when we need it. so we needed it today and we had no idea how to get it out of being a giant frozzen rasberry ice cube. we sat there in the back with huge butcher knives just stabbing the thing and then using a plasic spoon put the shavings in another bin to use. meanwhile we listened to the jason mraz cd FOUR TIMES. eventually we were covered in melted chunks of soggy rasberries and we had spilled the giant icecube on the table. after that, im not sure what really happened. all i know ids that i had to clean it up  *then i went home, changed and drove to clarsky dub's house,...just in time to say bye to ppl and to take byers home. but really we didnt go home, but had our own partay and picked up te$$  *we went to baker square and then partayed in the long lot with a hard-core q&a session. sorry u missed out.   *then i went home.   * i blogged  sad everyone is leaving and i feel that im never going to see anyone again. i really want to have a giant calander of when everyone is leaving and coming back cuz right now im flappin in the breeze here. i havnt packed and i have to be at the air port at 6 in the moonin at sat. i have some work to do.   well i will bid you farwell, if i be just for the night, or for the next couple of weeks. aye aye aye.   come visit me i work tmwr 4-cl  night lovers *~Al~*
honestly alex byers is the best person ever. like no matter what negative thing i say he always has something to turn it around. i could say that i hate the way the state of new york is shaped and he could tell me that maine is in the process of selling a chunk of land to NY and in the end it will look differnt. HcKYcHiCA06: but it pisses me off, like all the fricken love stuff BaSeBaLLa964: well a-weew-lo that is why u dont get involved like that BaSeBaLLa964: u get into really great friendships BaSeBaLLa964: and u just love life with ur friend  BaSeBaLLa964: and as far as tappin goes BaSeBaLLa964: i am always an option  i love this kid you dont even understand. and tmrw we are hittin a hot twins game, it will be a big day. and im working tmrw with yossi,  4-cl, EVERYONE come and visit me  no but reallyi had fun 2nite at avitals, we played the question game, which is fun like always, and just chilled. we did leave at about 1145 and i got hom eat like 1230, we just got hard-core lost. like not lost, just missed every possible exit and such.   over the last 2 days something happened that made me EXTREMELY happy, and something that just made me want to throw up again, out of like..anger?.. i dont even know. so if u think that u did the thing that made me happy please do it again for my sake, and if u think u did the thing that made me want to cry and enter into a feedle position, try and avoid it, or at least around me.   well, im off to bed, and i hate it. why do u always dream about the thing that u cant have, and is the last thing that u want to be thinking about. after a dream dont u wake up so happy that u finally got it, but then u realize that it was all a JOKE and u get to either go out and see the harsh truth in the real world, or go back to bed and have it happen all over again. yay. now im excited.   night world *striz*
who ever said that dress-up was for little kids was stupid. cuz im proud to say that in this last year alone i have played dress-up at leaste...mmm..18 times. no seriously i think like 5. thats kinda embarrising, but i wear it proudly. i think the only person that should be embarressed is clay, cuz he just looked stupid, or more likea beastie girl as i stated earlier. oh and claire, u looked like u were on every drug possible. sorry.  i want to bring to everyones attention that in the last 3 weeks i have seen david...1ce. ok, i was gone for two of those weeks, but i have been home for like a week and i have seen david 1ce. oh i forgot, hes too busy with every girl in the sophomore class, my bad. david, i thought that we had something, like we had some sort of connection. we went rollerblading around the lake together, that meant so much to me. i thought we were .... friends. **sniff**  moving on  boob-tag was fun last night. but its one of those games that no one wants to play, cuz u can NEVER relax the whole night. ur just reaching acrosse the table for some popcorn or sitting down, minding your own bizznas when....WWHACK...riioot in the boob. but it does keep everyone on their toes. by the way, who is IT?  ok this goes out to someone in paticular, but im not going to say who. i just want u to know that u mean so much to a lot of ppl, more people then u think. u make ppl laugh, and feel really good about themselves, especially me. you mean a lot to me and if anything happened to u i would be devistated. and i know a lot of people that feel the same. what ur thinking about would not help anything, even tho is seems like its only logical thing to do in ur case. but its not. at all. i bet thats what she thought too, but it didnt help a thing and think about how it made u feel, and what it has brought u to considereing. it would just bring more people to to feel what you are feeling right now. it woudl make everything worse. so many people love you, please know that. please, at least think about what i said.  ~)me(~
no if i were to serisouly blog fer real about eveything that i have been doing for the last 2 weeks u would be reading for a bout 5 1/4 hours. and i can pretty much skip church camp cuz i bet stess had some wicked blogs about it. but i can always brush on some highlights anyway   lake geneva CSI
I'm so obsessed with knitting, I decided I needed a spot where I could track my finished projects, muse about future projects, and generally go on about it all without being a drag on my regular journal, where I get to be boring about my life as a mama instead! I thought I'd just post pictures of my projects thus far, starting with my first scarf last November, which I made along with armwamers, with no pattern for a little family friend; however my son, Silas, is modeling them. They were made with some cheapy Lion Brand chenille, since I was deathly afraid of ruining good yarn, and I had yet to discover the many amazing yarn stores Seattle has to offer!        Next I made a couple facecloths for my sisters for Christmas:    I can't recall what order I made all of these, but I made them in December 03 and January 04. The kids' scarves have no pattern, nor does Vivienne's hat, but Silas' hat is 'Hot Head' from  Stitch 'n Bitch , as is my kerchief:          Next came my  urlLink Booga Bag , my first attempt at felting. I used Noro Kureyon #126:    Around the same time, I started a sweater for Silas. I only JUST finished it, so I'll post pictures as chronologically as I can manage. I also started the 'Little Black Top' from  Stitch 'n Bitch  for my sister, and a felted hat for my other sister. The hat is made with Cascade 220 (black) and a Dalegarn wool (purple), held together with a sparkly bit of something I bought off a cone at my LYS.    Next I decided to make a  urlLink little spring top  for Vivienne. I used Paton's Fresco, and loooved working with a ribbon yarn. It was a nice break from the Little Black Top.    Somewhere in there I made a spring shawl out of Plymouth Eros for our co-op preschool's annual auction, but I can't find any pictures. I did finally finish the 'Little Black (olive!) Top', and it fit my sister perfectly. It was my biggest success to that point. I had a huge sense of accomplishment.   Here is Susan showing it off:    I needed a major break from garments after that, but my addiction forced me to goof around with some spare yarns I had. So, yeah, a beer cozy:    That was pretty dorky, but it  did  inspire a little thing I consider to be pure genius:   (don't pretend you don't eat it out of the pint!)  Then  urlLink WEBS  had a huge sale and I got a steal on some closeout Cascade Lana D'Oro.  I started the 'Under the Hoodie', again from  Stitch 'n Bitch . I'm still working on it, currently working on the first sleeve, but here's a view of the back:    After frogging the sleeve once, I got sick of it and put it away for a few days. Well, of course, I couldn't NOT knit, so I seamed up Silas' sweater at long last:       And that, my friends, brings us up to today! Still plugging away at Under the Hoodie, having made numerous stupid mistakes on the sleeve and having had to frog it twice. Next up is Knitty's  urlLink Cleo  for my other sister, Helen. I'm also planning on a cardigan by Kristin Sperklund from the  urlLink Interweave  free subscriber patterns for Viv, but I have yet to buy yarn or anything. I need to start thinking holidays, too!  Okay. That's it for my first foray into blogging! C
I finished another  urlLink tiny ribby tank , except I changed it up a bit-- crossed the straps in the back and did a 3-needle bind-off instead of kitchener to graft the straps. This one is for my friend J's little cutie. Hopefully she will send me a picture of C modeling it!     Now, onto Cleo for real. C
Look at this yummy yarn:   It came today, for  urlLink Cleo , for my oldest sister. I'm so pleased she decided to order this yarn. It's soft and the color is amazing. Kinda splitty, but I think I'll get used to it. And, for the first time in my personal swatching history, my gauge was spot-on the very first try! I love  urlLink elann.com . I got a good price on the yarn, and I received my order in two business days. I'm excited to start it, but I think I will finish up Tiny Ribby Tank #2 first. C
Here's Vivienne in her new tank:     poser!     She immediately pulled like crazy on one of the straps & stretched it all to hell. Damn cotton. I washed it on warm/ gentle and it looked really messed up upon coming out of the wash, so I now have it on delicate tumble dry with hopes it's not ruined. Ayeeee. C
A LiveJournal friend recently knit  urlLink this cute tank  for her daughter, and I was inspired to make one for Miss Viv. I happened to get some uber-clearance Lily Baby Cotton, so this cost me seriously less than $3 to knit. I had to learn kitchener stitch, which sounded easier than it was. Actually, the execution wasn't that hard, but it doesn't look that great. I need to figure out the trick to making it look nice & neat, I guess. Anyway, overall, I'm pleased with the top.     The very middle stripe is leftover variegated cotton I had from some dishcloths. It looks much better in person than it does in the picture. It's obviously too late to have V model it, so I will add a picture of her showing it off tomorrow. These quickie projects are very satisfying to instant-gratification types like me.  The yarn arrived for my sister's  urlLink Cleo  halter. It isn't quite as it appeared on my monitor. I guess there's the flaw in bargain-hunting online. I think it will work out okay, though. That's the next thing on the needles, and I will work on my hoodie here & there, too. I really want to make a big, soft afghan, too, in hopes my husband will finally get rid of the holey, sun-bleached, monkey-vomit-green one he's had forever. C               Â
I made the Umbilical Cord Hat from S'nB for a friend's new baby this evening. It's nice to know there's a pattern I can just whip out in an evening when friends have babies! It's cream-colored, despite looking white in the photo.     Such a nice, easy thing to knit! C
So my ice cream cozy was featured on  urlLink Cozy of the Week . If you want to knit one, too, here's the made-up-as-I-went pattern:  On size 5 US double pointed knitting needles, cast on 48 stitches, join, and divide among 3 needles.  Knit 3 rows in k2p2 rib.   Knit two rows.   Add in scrap novelty yarn and knit however much you want with that.   When you are about halfway done, k2tog after the sixth stitch on each needle.   Add more eyelash or whatever as you see fit. About 3/4 way through, do the k2tog decrease again.  For the next 2 rows, k2p2 rib, then cast off in rib. The last row should be the bottom of your cozy.  I'm thinking after I finish the second sleeve, I'm going to put my hoodie aside for a bit. I need to knit the Umbilical Cord Hat from Stitch 'n Bitch for a friend's new baby, then I think I'll knit up one of  urlLink these  cuties for Viv. I got some Lily Baby Cotton for next to nothing today at Joann, since my store is moving and they are clearing everything out. I think it will work well for both the umbilical cord hat and the tiny ribby tank. C
It's not so beautiful outside today, and T & I were out late celebrating his birthday last night, which leads me to think today would be a good day to sit around and knit. Unfortunately, I'm really sick of my hoodie. I can't start Viv's cardigan, since I'm waiting for the yarn to arrive. I can't start Cleo for my sister, because again, I'm waiting for the yarn. Ayeee. I guess I will just tough it our and work on the hoodie. I just want to be done with it already. I should look through my stash to see if I have some random cotton to make Viv a little tank. So, the new issue of  urlLink Knitty . People are all a-swirl on the various knitting communities. People seems to feel strongly. I don't. I think some of the stuff is cute, though I am more inclined to make things I can show off, I guess because I'm still newish and it feels like such a giant accomplishment every time I finish a piece. I am considering making  urlLink hush hush . It's really beautiful. I might wear it in public, actually. I'm thinking a silvery grey with black and hot pink ribbon. Ohh, Maybe I'll knit the top in black, the rest in the silvery grey and pink ribbon. Hmmmm. If I do, I'm sure it will take me ages. I can see it being something to have perpetually in progress when I get sick of scarves, hats and sweaters over the winter, and then voila! Next spring, I'd have a lovely little nightie/ dress. We'll see. Time to vacuum and do dishes, then I will hunker down with the sleeves to my hoodie. C
I finally got through the lace band! It's really a cool pattern, once you sit down and do it with out small-child interruptions! I expect I'll finish the body today and then I need to go back and make another triangle.     It's a little dark, and it's squished onto the circs, but you get the idea.  What's next? I am going to finish off a Big Bad Baby Blanket for my friend,  urlLink langus , who has thrown in the towel. Then I need to decide whether to focus on a bag for me-- I've got some  Lamb's Pride Bulky in black and a nice deep pink waiting for me to knit & felt. I have a cardigan I want to start for Viv. I need to go back and add the hood to my hoodie. And then there's xmas presents... I'm pretty sure there will always be plenty of projects awaiting me from here on out. C
oh. my. god.  Cleo is slowly killing me. I've ripped out one of the bra triangles twice. I got sick of that, so I moved on to the lace band, and guess what? I've ripped it out not once, not twice, but ohhhh 5 or 6 times! I've lost count. I need one full evening of total silence to get the lace band done, and done right.  If I don't get it right next time, I may throw in the towel and come back to it next spring. ugh.  I hate when knitting sucks. C
Well, here I am, all alone, nobody to talk to. I'm Bored... I think I'll make this a place to write my poems even though I suck at writing poems coz I'm more of a story writer. Well since I have nothing better to do I will write a poem now. Here goes.  Yesterday, You didn't have a clue, Yesterday, I seemed a little blue, Yesterday, The truth I thought to tell, Yesterday, My life was a living hell.  Today, You're there with me, Today, My life is filled with glee, Today, The truth is told for you, Today, I still feel blue.  I may have come out but my life still troubles me. A little weight is lifted but theres still so much that hurts me. I still have to get used to the fact that things will be different. But even if they are good things, it makes me uncomfortable. My parents act differently, they think things that are wrong. I've always been like this, and just because I am who I am, doesn't change the reasons for the things I like. You who read this may not fully understand what I mean, You're not like me, but one day it will be better. One day... I'll be truely happy. I just wish to be happy... now.  Well ne way. Forget ur trouble come on get happy! You better chase ur cares away. lol I like that song. =P    FUNKY FUN AND STUFF! BYE BYE!
I rushed my English work so much today that I lost my really detailed front cover and forgot to draw an important diagram inside it! Well ne way, who has used an electric roulet game that zapps your finger!? Well I HAVE! and i put both my fingers in it creating a full body circuit around my arms causing me to be highly zapped 3 times IN A ROW!!!!! Well, ne way... actually I don't know what comes next... APPLE!!!! ...no ... ... FINGER NAILS!!! Don't you just love finger nails? They're great. I could talk about finger nails all day long! They're really handy when u r opening a can of drink, and when you need to scratch ur bak! If finger nails didn't exist I wouldn't know what to do. They can also come in handy when u r trying to get barcodes off products that u hav just bought. Usually they just end up ripping though!  If I could turn back time, I wouldn't change a thing! But even in my prime, My heart forgets to sing. Secrets hidden so long, Have stopped me from myself, And when I find me soon, I'll prop me on my shelf.  Thankyou and goodnight! You've been a gr8 audience!

ALEX'S HOT TOPIC #1: Always wear underwear, no matter what you're wearing over them!!! coz sum1 might dak u!  I HAVE A JOKE!!!  ALEX'S JOKE #1: 'Knock Knock' ... 'Who'z there!?' ... 'Mary!' ... 'Mary who!?' ... 'MARY CHRISTMAS!!!'  Sorry, that joke was in a little kids winnie the pooh christmas cracker and it made me and my friends laugh alot! NOT THAT WE FOUND IT FUNNY! Just how stoopid it was!  Once upon a time there was a boy called Boagle! He went to Horty Torty Primary Skool! He was sooo silly coz he constantly fell in a hole! Well this one time, he had just arrived at skool, he walked into the grounds and fell in a hole... and THEN he went and played downball! But the ball hit him and he fell in a hole! So he went and fell in a hole... and THEN he went to class, which had a hole in the doorway and he fell in it! THE END!!!  Stay tuned for more Boagle!  THATS ALL FOR NOW!!!! BABAU FROM AKIRA (Alex) YAY! WOOT!
OK OK  In my last blog which was a few minutes ago, I forgot to give a hot topic AND a joke AND i forgot to write the next installment of boagle, the boy who falls in holes. So here goes:   ALEX'S HOT TOPIC #2:  What ever you do, never and I mean NEVER put your face at the entrance of ball returners at AMF bowling. Coz you never know when a chicken is going to hit you in the head! I mean a BALL! Not a chicken!   ALEX'S JOKE #2:  What did the elephant say to the giraffe?   How did you ever get so tall and thin while I'm stuck in this fat, heavy body?  I KNOW I KNOW! It isn't funny and really it's not a joke... but I didn't have any on hand!   Adventures of Boagle, Episode 2:   It was the weekend and boagle felt like riding his bike, so he went out the back and  fell in a hole . Then he got on his bike and  fell in a hole . He rode around the block three times and through Horty Torty School twice. Then he sat down and  fell in a hole . So he sat down on a grassy knoll. He got out his sandwich which was actually a  hole  and he  fell in it . So he went and  fell in a hole . On his way home he  fell in a hole  and then he  fell in a hole . Around the corner he  fell in a hole , and in the driveway, and at the door, and in his room. So he came to the conclusion of watching where he walks, so he immediately...   ...fell in a hole.    STAY TUNED FOR MORE BOAGLE!!!

Woohoo - she'll be here tomorrow! - which probably means I need to clean the place up a bit - uh oh :(  Since Jen's going to get a car we'll be able to at least grab some furniture so she'll have somewhere to sit - and she has timed it perfectly for the pool opening on the weekend.  While I'm slaving away in work, she can lie by the pool and fight with the cicadas :)  Got my HDTV Cable hookup - unfortunately the on-demand function seems to have broken in the meantime, so I have to get out early again today so someone can come look at it.  On the brighter side of things techie I managed to blag two 1U dual PIII 866 machines for free, I'll swap the mobo's out into a more reasonable case and hook them up at home - no idea what I'll use them for yet but I'm betting that they'll munch a few SETI units in the meantime while I figure it out.....  One last thing - where the hell is the Alt Gr button on US keyboards? - it annoys me to have to type Alt+0128 for the Euro (â¬) symbol and then have to remember what the code is for accented e etc.  I know I could change the keymap to UK or whatever but I shouldn't have too - how about an Alt Gr option or something?  *end of rant*
That's right, this is the week, Jen arrives on Thursday and will be staying right through to the following Sunday - Yay! :)  Also on the good news front, I now have Cable TV, Broadband and a new mattress.  On the not-so-good-news-for-Jenny front I still don't have a bed frame, a couch, or even something besides the floor for her to sit on......  On the other hand that does mean that she will have plenty of reasons to do that favourite female pastime - shopping! And with someone else's money no less - always the best way to do it.  Should be getting a few rack mounted dual PIII's gratis from the job too - will be nice to play with them, maybe set up a beowulf cluster or something else equally difficult to configure :)  After all I'll need something to do with my spare time when Jen leaves :)
I'll be getting bot a new mattress and cable TV/Cable internet on Saturday.  The prospect of Digital Cable with HDTV and a 3MB cable connection makes me drool :)  Should be cool - though I still need some furniture - a desk, a couch, a coffee table etc.  The place looks so bare without anything - though the stacks of DVD's books and cd's help a bit - so shelves are on the list of things to buy too.....  At least the TV works as a monitor so I'll be able to actually able to use my cable connection when I get it.  Hopefully the next post will be from my G4 cube hanging of a 3MB cable connection :)
My stuff from Ireland arrived this morning - so I now have all my CD's, DVD's, clothes etc.  Unfortunately I have nowhere to put them :(  On the bright side though, I  did  get my new  urlLink TV .  Not a bad price either.  Plan is to use that for now and them wall mount it in the bedroom when I get my bigscreen TV later.  I've been looking at some of the 50' to 60' DLP screens but I can't decide at the moment.    My phone should be hooked up tomorrow which just leaves the Cable to go, fingers crossed I'll be up and running by Monday - it's always nice to have a 3 MB internet connection :)  Got a nice aerobed to sleep on for now, my mattress has been ordered and should be here on Saturday.  No word on my bed frame yet though - can't win them all I suppose.
I've decided to document my little adventure in America.  My previous attempt at a blog ( urlLink http://adam.killingmachines.org ) has fallen by the wayside somewhat, but I think with some of Blogger's extra features, I should be able to rectify that situation. Besides all that - it will give me somewhere to moan about the red tape infested wold you end up in when you immigrate into the US these days.  Anyways, on with the blogging - after nearly 6 weeks in the country I finally have a new place to live - right next to Reston town center. The rent is reasonable and the big bonus is that I'm within walking distance of the job, which is good given how hard it is to get a drivers license in the state of Virginia when you were born outside the US.  Go take a look at the  urlLink requirements (pdf)  for yourself and try to figure out how many of those documents you might have. It turns out that the only thing I can use to prove my identity besides my passport is the I-797 form I got when applying for my Visa. Not too bad you might think, but then I applied for the Visa in January, so my memory of forms I obtained is a little hazy. It was only when I got desparate and started Googling every form listed on the sheet to see if I could get one that I found out I had the I-797 already. Once I get the learner's permit it's just 30 days until I can take the test - that should be just in time for delivery of the new car :)  Other than that things have been going pretty well. I'm finally going to learn PERL tomorrow - properly this time too - not my usual half assed attempt - the company are paying for an intensive 3 day advanced course - it would be nice to know at least one programming language properly.  Most importantly, my lovely (and far too good for me) girlfriend is visiting in a couple of weeks - all I have to do now is make sure there are things like a bed, chairs, tables in the new place before she comes. Another trip to IKEA is needed methinks.....  That's enough for now - more when I get bored :)
Not so much from the what happened point of view as from the 'thank God it's over' point of view.  For some reason I was shattered this week - I essentially passed out around 9 p.m. on Wednesday night and slept right through.  Then my bloody ankle started to act up- just when I thought it was getting better.....  On the plus side I found the excellent  urlLink Dia  program which should do as a nice replacement for Visio - who needs licensed software anyway?  The IC department in work finally delivered the Linux box I ordered.  They'd imaged it with Redhat 9, but I didn't like the way they had the disks partitioned and I like to stay a bit more current, so following a plesant experience with  urlLink Fedora Core 2  on my laptop, I installed that instead.  The box itself is a decent spec considering they gave me whatever they had spare - it's a 2.4 Ghz P4 Dell- not bad at all.  Now I'm going to watercool my shuttle system so it stops making so much noise.  Annoyingly it looks like I might have to replacethe RAM in that system - seems to have developed somenasty errors - every time I try to view a Windows Media player video on it the program crashes - and games work for about 5 seconds.  Strangely  enough Quicktime seems to play fine so maybe it's a directx memory addressing issue or summat.
Well, now that things are settling down a bit I find I have a bit of spare time on my hands.  I have plenty of things on my to-do list but I've got some stuff done.  First off I have kicked off the transition of  urlLink Comerford.cc  to  urlLink PHP Nuke .  I won't be using Dreamweaver to administer the site anymore, because I no longer have a license for it with the change of job, hence the transition to a more web based management of the site.  You can view the initial template here:  urlLink Nuke Site .  In fact now that I have switched jobs a lot of my licenses are hosed - Photoshop is gone too, not to mention Windows XP Pro (I do have an XP Home license, but why bother.....).  There was a time when I would have just kept on using them illegally but that's over.  Usually I can find an alternative that's free and usually Open Source, so that's what I intend to do - just for kicks, here'sthe list and the alternative:    Windows XP --> Linux (currently Fedora Core 2 but that may change)  Dreamweaver --> PHPNuke & BlueFish/Quanta  Photoshop --> The GIMP  Firefox --> Same, just on Linux :)  Thunderbird --> Same, just on Linux :)    Fedora Core 2 is currently running happily on my little Sony R505DL laptop, and all of the bits and pieces, besides the scroll wheel (which I never used anyway) is working.  I'vealso managed to get an RSS feed to work on PHP Nuke by converting the Atom feed.  I put a little guide up on how I did it here:  urlLink Atom to RSS .  So, left on the to-do list:   Install Linux on the Xbox  Build out my two other dual CPU boxes and get them up and running Linux  Design a new theme (or use an existing one) for the Nuke Site    And there's probably more I'll dream up along the way.  That's it for now......
Woohoo! - I got my learners permit!  This time I got every question right, though if I'd had this test last time I would have had no trouble then either - just the luck of the draw I guess.....  Now all I have to do is learn how to drive before my car arrives next month :)  Yesterday was a pretty good day all round in fact - as well as the successful test, the Pistons destroyed the Lakers.  Since I had 20 euro on the Pistons at 8-1 odds I was pretty happy :)  A fact that I am now paying for since my happiness inspired me to drink 7 or 8 beers, oh well.  So, no going out for me tonight - have an 8 o'clock start in work tomorrow and I need some sleeeeep.
Just realised I never mentioned the new chair - My Lazboy arrived on Saturday and I'm glad tosay it rocks :)  On the bad side of things - I managed to fail the theory test on the Virginia drivers license exam so I have to re-take it tomorrow........grrrr  What's annoying is that I needed 20 correct out of 25 and I got 19 - the last question was how much more likely you are to have an accident if you are drunk - 5 times, 7 times, 10 times or 12 times.  How the hell am I supposed to know that - so I went for 12 times and got it wrong - pain in the ass. At least I can get another lift down to the DMV early next week.  Guess I better get studying :)
Finally got around to installing linux (fedora core2) on the laptop - it is working quite well, I even have wireless networking going on it, using the Netgear WG511 card I bought a while back - Nice :)  Also have the bare bones for 2 new systems - one dual PIII 1Ghz and one dual PIII 866.  The second one will be donated at cost to Mr. Irwin who has been good enough to drive me around the whole time and populate my apartment :)  The other will be my default file/web/whatever server on my home network.  Since it has RAID capabilities I should be able to come up with a nice fast machine :)  Haven't decided what to run on it yet - BSD or Linux......Fedora doesn't seem too bad so far, gentoo is a possibility if I'm bothered putting the time in, then BSD is as stable and secure as it gets, hmmmmmmm...  Anyways - back to watching the basketball, after seeing England go down to France tonight, a Pistons win would be the icing on the cake :)
Yesterday wasn't bad - in order to keep myself busy I cleaned the place up a bit - moved a book case to where it is going to live permanently, relocated all of my computers to the new desk, fitted a mod-chip to the X-Box and fitted a half length PCI graphics card to my Qube - whew!  At least now I can use the nice shiny new  urlLink LCD  that I got from  urlLink Iiyama  rather than the television.  Next thing to do is get Linux, probably  urlLink gentoox , working on the Xbox.  Not because I need another box, but because I hate it when companies like M$ try to dictate what you can and can't do with something you bought..........  On the bad news side, my lazboy chair which was going to be delivered today will have to wait til Saturday - they picked the one time to deliver it that I absolutely could not make it home - so much for a 4 hour delivery 'window'.  Roll on Saturday :) At least my bed will be complete by this evening, I'm working from home (at the new desk) so I can accept delivery of the base.  Sin Ã© for now......
Jen left last night and it was 10 times worse than when we said goodbye back in the Old Country - at least then I had all the excitement of going to a new job, a new country, a new apartment etc.  Even the fact that my Lazboy recliner is coming tomorrow can't cheer me up.  It's DMV time once again this week too which does nothing for my mood - though hopefully they'll at least accept my application.  Last thing I want is to have a nice shiny new car and not be able to drive it........  Anyways, I can't wait for September when she'll be back, then all I have to do is help her find a job here and she can stay!   Here's hoping.....
My apartment now looks like someone actually lives there, my DVD's, CD's and books are up off the floor, though not arranged in any meaningful order yet ;)  As soon as the desk arrives (should be tomorrow) I'll post some decent pictures of the whole thing.  The only disaster was the CD storage unit I got from IKEA - I put it together, after having a few drinks at 1 a.m. and managed to essentially put all the shelves int he wrong way so that the screws are visible - uh oh.  Anyway, once full of CD's you can't see the screws, so not too much of a disaster :)  The sofa/couch is ordered too, now all I need is a lazy boy and I'm sorted - should be going to the lazboy store tonight/tomorrow night to take a look at the options there.  Of course none of this would be possible without the arrival of my lovely girlfriend who can drive while she is here.  She's also pretty nifty with a screw driver and allen key :)  Right now I believe she is amusing herself in Leesburg Outlet mall while I 'slave' away in work.  Speaking of slaving, I better get back to it.....
Unfortunately it sems that my webhosting company has gone tits up.  Urban-ISP.net no longer resolves, they don't return e-mails and their phones are disconnected.  Looks like that is that.  Because I recently lost my back up of the site I have lost most of the content too :(    A few exceptions are my blog (obviously) and a couple of pages I found in the Google cache.  Ah well, I suppose the site needed to be revamped anyway - still, it is incredibly annoying.....
OK, I knew that the whole Atkins diet low carb thing was big in the US but I was still surprised when I got here at how pervasive the whole thing is.  I'm prepared to live with it because, lets face it, most of us could stand to shed a few punds - me  definitely  included :)  But just now I saw an ad on the TV - it was for a low carb  DOG FOOD  from Pedigree!!!  That is taking things too far - I mean, sure I got a great laugh from it, but it is getting ridiculous - if your dog is too fat, the TAKE HIM FOR A WALK MORE OFTEN - DUH!
Decided it was time to flex my coding muscles this week so I've put together a little tool that converts IP Addresses, URL's and Host names into Autonomous System numbers and gives a few other little tidbits while it's at it too.  It can be found here:   urlLink AS Number Tool   Of course it can be found on the old  urlLink homepage  too.  It all came about because I couldn't find anything to do this for me - needless to say there's a command line version that I use personally too.  Now most people reading this are probably wondering what the hell an Autonomous System is - well first off I'd like to clarify that I mean an Internet Autonomous System, not a Mathematical one.    To use a poor analogy, think of them as the country codes and area codes used in the telephony world - without them you wouldn't have long distance calling because the exchanges and switches would have no idea where to send your call to.  Well AS numbers are something like that in the internet routing world.  Go to  urlLink Wikipedia  to learn more about  urlLink them .
Went to see Spiderman 2 last night - have to say that I liked it - didn't have the fun of the first one when you were learning how they were going to implement all the superpowers and stuff but still good none the less.  Some soppy bits - to be expected in a blockbuster these days - but the effects were good and the action scenes were well put together.  Special effects weren't as jaw dropping as The Day After Tomorrow that I saw last week - never has a film with such a weak story line been saved so well by special effects in my opinion.  Oh, and I've found out that I'll have a  choice  as to where I can watch the Euro 2004 final.  There's a bar in Arlington - Summers - and, if I'm too hung over, there's always Comcast PPV :)
The site has been down/slow for the last couple of day - no idea why and I'm too lazy to find out.  Hence the reson for the lack of new entries - I have confirmation that my shiny new Audi A4 is on the way to the dealer and everything is in motion - now all I need is that license.  Unfortunately I have to wait until 15th July until I can do the test since there's a 30 day waiting period before you can take the test.  Still, at least it gives me a little while to learn........  I may need the full license to get the car registered and released to me too, which is probably a good thing - having the car parked outside the apartment and not being able to drive it would drive me nuts.  Hopefully I'll know today or tomorrow exactly how much of a dent this will make in my finances too.  With insurance, the downpayment, the initial loan payment and sales tax - it's adding up pretty quickly.  Fingers crossed the up front total is under $20,000 - anything more than that and I'll have to put off buying anything else for a couple of weeks - like food for example :)  Back to work...........
I got a letter yesterday, from Audi Financial saying my credit application had been turned down.  Naturally, this frightened the crap out of me and it was too late to contact anyone by then.  Thankfully it was all a false alarm, the letter was generated by accident and everything is fine with my car again :)  Hopefully I can get my license by next week - I've booked an appointment for a test for next Friday (yes I know it's the 13th) which gives me another week or so to get everything down, which should be plenty.  Now there's a change from Ireland - no 9 month wait to take a test.....
Picked up the new car yesterday - I still can't drive it without a licensed driver in the car too but that should all be rectified soon enough. Pictures can be found  urlLink here .  On the techy front, I finally managed to get some of my content back up following the Urban-ISP disaster.  The  urlLink How to flash a FireWire/i-Link DVD  page is back - people seemed to find that helpful, so I'm happy I got it back.  Most of the other stuff is hosed however :*(
I cant believe that im actually making another online journal/diary thing. The last time I had one of these I was in 7th grade. Seems a little immature to go back and make one. But like I told Matt, I enjoy typing a lot more than I like writing. I remember back in Middle School, EVERYONE who was anyone had an online journal. I still don't really get why people write about their secret issues like they would in a private journal/diary online, on a PUBLIC journal thing. Doesn't really make sense to me, but hey...im doing it aren't I? Anyway...I remember I had my online journal till the middle of 9th grade, then after two incidents I decided it wasn't worth it anymore. The first one occurred at the end of my 8th grade year with one of my close friends at the time, Teresa (she moved away, up to West Palm Beach). She obviously had an online journal as well and was actually one of the people that talked me into starting one. Well, to sum up Teresa, she was never the cool cheerleader that everybody liked or even the nerdy art student who everybody knew but pretended not to. She was apart of our little 'click' at school that everyone seemed to stay away from. And of course, people always made fun of us for the way we dressed and the music we listened to. It was so immature, but I guess that's middle school. Its funny cause I look back on it now and I think to myself...God damn was I a fat little idiot. And I see my sister going through the same fazes and changes that I did in/at her grade/age (wow, that's confusing to look at). Anyway, so we were all made fun of a lot and whatever. So Teresa writes about it in her online journal. And I think this was all about one or two years after the Columbine incident. And she's writing in her journal that she's gonna get these kids back before the end of the year and blah blah blah. But of course, all of us know she means just like make fun of them behind their backs because that's Teresa. She doesn't have the balls to walk up to one of them and hit them in the face. Or for that fact, bring a gun to school and shoot everybody up. So somehow somebody in the school reads that entry and decides to turn it in to the School board. And of course my journal has a direct link to hers and vice versa and I wrote stuff like that too in mine, so im not the little innocent angel either here. Well, we are both brought down to the office and blah blah shit happens. They talked to us about the 'seriousness' of this situation and all that other garbage, whatever. In the long haul, Teresa gets expelled and I get suspended, for like a day and then my dad goes down there and raises hell. And well, that's the reason Teresa moves up to West Palm. I feel kind of bad sometimes cause we promised we wouldn't lose touch and I guess we really haven't, but we aren't nearly as close as we once were. I think that might have to do with the fact that she's doing drugs and drinking now, but whatever. Well, that pretty much sums up the first incident. The 2nd one happened with my first girlfriend. The summer right after 8th grade, I meet this incredibly hot girl in my neighborhood through my friend at the time, Johnny, who is actually her brother...go figure. She was such a nice person to me, knowing that I had never had any past experience with girls or anything. This was the girl I lost my virginity to...the sick part was, another girl was involved. That was the one weird thing about Jennifer, is that she was bi-sexual. She had this friend who lived down the street named Megan who was such a little whore and she was only 14. I think I was like just turning 15, so I guess im no better than she was. And Megan would come over and just hit on me non stop...I don't understand why, I was so fat and stupid then...still am, but...a little better. So anyway, we dated for about 3 months and then she broke up with me for some bogus reason, I forget why. I was completely devastated by this too, being my first girlfriend and all AND the girl I lost my virginity to, I was pretty fucked up by it all, so anyway. I knew the real reason behind it. It was because she wanted to date other people cause she was a whore. So yeah, I wrote about it in my online journal. And I called her a whore in it and blah blah and how we had sex in a threesome with another chick blah blah. And im guessing she knew what the address of my online journal was cause she showed her new boyfriend at the time who was this 6ft tall, in shape, knew martial arts, black guy. Yeah, bad news for me written all over that description. Well, I used to ride the bus home back then, cause I didn't have a car and Freddy hadn't moved down yet so I couldn't ride with him. So, one day I get off the bus and he for some reason rode our bus that day. Well, I have my headphones on and im walking home, and this guy decides he wants to fuck with me. He gets in my face and I take my headphones off. This dude doesn't say anything, he just hands me this piece of paper, which I find out later is my diary entry. And when I look down at the paper I look up right after and he fucking hits me in the face. He fucking sucker punches right in the face. Me, never being in a real fight before (only instances with which I've punched a kid out and held one up against a locker with one arm, I had never actually been in a fight with another kid swinging at me) fell to the ground like a ton of bricks. Woke up, walked home with a swollen face and that was that. I never saw the kid in school again though. I wasn't sure if he transferred or whatever...and Jennifer ended up moving so yeah. Those are my two reasons for not having an online journal anymore. Wow...I ended up writing a lot more than I had intended to. Well anyway, till next time...
So today was boring. Woke up at 9am...ate breakfast (which Lyn made for me and Amanda...it was goooood) then went swimming and then I went to work. Nothing exciting happened at work so im gonna flash back to yesterday, which actually was fun and im gonna re-title my entry right here. Also im going to speak in the tense as if it were yesterday...or is yesterday...i dunno...   My Fun Day With Matt!!  Today was awesome. I really need to hang out with Matt more often. I love it, cause even if we dont do anything, if we are just sitting around, we always find something to talk about, no matter what. If its music, movies, video games...doesnt matter, always enjoyable. The only somewhat not enjoyable part of the day is when Roxy and Manda decided to come over and have a sit down talk. Which we found funny because I had suggested it earlier, before they came, to do something like that later in the night. So, we all sat down and tried discussing everyones feelings on everything. I  kind   of think it may have helped, but then again...its easy to say something like that wont happen again, but its a lot harder for it to not actually happen. I dunno. Well, after that we all decided to try and patch things up by having a quick lunch together at Taco Bell before parting our seperate ways. After that Matt and I went over to Circuit City to check out some games that Matt was thinking about buying cause he heard that they were selling them for cheap. They ended up not having any that he 'needed' so went over to look at the music section, looked around there for a while where Matt spotted a three disk deal for only $20...he bought it and then we left and went over to Target. He got the stuff he needed and then we picked up Amanda and drove around looking for something to do but ended up just going back to his house. Stayed there till we had to go pick up Jason and then we went back to Matts and played some video games. It was a very enjoyable day. Im hoping Wednesday will be just as fun, cause thats my only other day off this week. Im also really excited about next week though...I get to go up to Port St. Lucie to visit my cousins who i havent seen for like over a year or two. The only downside is that my moms living there now and its gonna be extremely gay. Welp, till next time...  By the way...I LOVE THE MOUSE! ITS AWESOME!
What a shitty 4th of July. I guess it wasnt too bad...except for the awkwardness between certain individuals. Of course i had to ditch work to have this 'fun' day, and for that i got bitched at from my dad AND had a guilt trip given to me from my manager. Then me, Amanda, Roxanne, Matt and Courney drive down to Matt Harpers house to light off fireworks. That was actually a lot of fun, its really funny how afraid of fireworks Amanda really is. After all that, we (me and Roxanne really) decide we should go down to the beach, and Alex decides to come along too. So we get down there and its great, the waters so warm and me and Roxy give each other this look of 'Oh god we wanna go in!' So finally we do. I actually took my shirt off...ewwww...and i somehow talked Roxy into taking her pants off. All she had on was a pink thong...jeez was that hot. I felt bad for looking since Amanda was there, but she has been pissing me off lately. Well, to make a long story short, Matt doesnt come in cause he doesnt like the beach to begin with and then of course Roxy and Amanda call him anti-social and all that, he gets pissed blah blah, everyone ends up pissed at each other. Then we drive back and Amanda decides to go with Alex and Roxy back to his house and leaves me home by myself (cause i had to be home early because of my dad), fucking god she pisses me off sometimes. I dont even know why i listen to her. She only ever thinks of herself. Of course she always does the lovey duvey shit. Oh i love you this, i love you that. But thats all it is. She can never compromise a situation. Its either her way or the highway. And she wonders why i get pissed off sometimes. Ive gotten to the point that i just want to punch her in the face, just square in the fucking face just so she would stop talking or laughing or whatever she was doing at the time. I wish things were the way they used to be when we first started going out. But i guess everybody wishes that from time to time. She doesnt get how things work sometimes though. If i ever make her feel bad for any little fucking thing, im a dick. And then all this drama with Matt and Roxanne. They talked...that did a lot of fucking good now didnt it?! All Matt wants to do is make everything out to be his fault, i keep telling him it isnt, but he just wont listen. And then Roxanne just doesnt understand why things happen when she does stupid shit...its like Amanda in a way...just she sometimes thinks things through a bit more...sometimes...UGH! I love them both though, i really do. I dont think i could think about life without them as friends...even though i havent really known either of them for very long, i feel so close to them. I just wish they could get past this fucking...THING between them. Its so frustrating. God this sucks. I havent felt this way in almost a year. Having so much shit on my mind that I just wanna cry 24/7. Of course thats a real pussy thing to say, but who cares...no one reads this damn thing anyway. First my mom decides she wants to come back into my life. And of course my asshole dad constantly getting on my case all the damn time. Then theres the pressures of money and thinking of how im gonna pay for college...what college im gonna go to. I dont even know anymore. Now all this other shit with two of my best friends AND more frustrations from my own girlfriend of a year. I wish this thing would give me some kind of feed back for my problems. I guess that kind of defeats the purpose of a journal though, huh? I mean, in a real book one you wouldnt get any feed back. Eh, whatever...im done writing, till next time...
So today was pretty damn uneventful. I had to wake up early this morning to go down to my dads old shop in North Miami. The place is called Aamco, its kind of funny that even though my dad doesn't actually work there, he can go in and use the shop for whatever he wants...and the guy who owns the place still pays him $150 a week...FOR NO REASON! Well, there probably is a reason, since my dads a fucking gangster, he more than likely owes him money or some shit and he's paying it off slowly, lol. So im there till about 11:30am then my dad asks me to do him a favor. He hands me $10 and tells me to pick up my sister and her friend from the house and then drive down to Sheridan Street. Which is like a good 10 minute drive one way, and I was exhausted to begin with. The really shitty part is, that on the way back, I got fucking lost...and then it starts to down poor. Like cats and dogs down poor, it sucked. I ended up having to call my dad to figure out where I was. I hate the high-way sometimes, its not descriptive enough. Like one sign will say, 'North,' but the street you're already on is going North. And then there's no other sign saying that the road you are on now, is going to start going in a completely different direction then the one you were going in. ITS SO CONFUSING! Maybe im just dumb...or not...who knows. So anyway, I get home, take a nap, and go to work. And work is fine, no problems, lots of conversation, not too boring...but when we close Chris comes up to me and tells me my fucking drawer is $6.05 short. I don't understand how that happen, its never happened before. Well, good news is we made a tip cup that night and I made $3, so I gave him the three and he said he would cover the rest for me this time. God damn did that suck, lol. Wow...what an exciting day...and now I have to hope that I can somehow talk Rich (the new General Manager at the store) into not making me come in tomorrow ::wishes self good luck:: Welp, till next time...
GOD DAMN IT! This is another major reason why I hate writing online. Because if you have a shit computer, like I do, and it freezes when you are in the middle of a very long entry...YOURE FUCKED! Cause then you lose everything you just said! GRRRR! Well, I guess I'll just sum up everything I said before...basically I was saying how Friday nights suck because usually I have to work. And then I went on into how I get confused with my thoughts. Mostly due to the on going struggle between good and evil inside my head. I guess it wasnt all that much...but it seemed like a lot since I went into such deep detail. Fuck it, thats enough for right now. Maybe I will write later...till next time.
I heard about a couple of jobs at work I applied for the other day. I didn't receive an interview. I'm pretty dissappointed about it, I thought my application was quite good... I was never expecting to get either of the jobs, there are people at work who definitely deserve them more than I but it is still a sensation not dissimiliar to a kick in the teeth. All my friends rallied around to make me feel better but of course when you feel like that there is very little someone can do to help. It's a matter of stewing for a few days and then getting over it, I am becoming a master this year it seems. I offered my application to my friends at work for there opinion, they all said it was pretty good, but I only got a truly honest opinion from one, my good friend anthony, he told me that while it was good, I used passive language which they warn you against, I really appreciate his honesty, you have to respect it. I think he might be one of those friends you meet rarely that you should try and hold on to for the rest of your life.. you can't waste a good friend. I actually feel the bunch of guys I've met in the last couple of years while working where I am, are the best I have ever made, they are not like some of the friends I had in high school who seem to use when appropriate and forget you at other times and I honestly don't think they ever thought about it, or the friends they are unwilling or just unable to share any emotions deeper than a bottle of beer with you.. at some point you must grow up.  I was told by Anthony the other day when he read this for the first time that adnd is an old acronym for Dungeons and Dragons dating back to 2nd Edition and that die-hards upon reading my first post would pick me up on it... and I have to say if that is so, then you really must start doing something more than dnd with your life, okay! I love the game, but really!
my wife just walked in and placed a big bag of pistachios on the table next to me... they are nice. I usually buy a handful when I go to play adnd with the guys, playing adnd is nice.. no actually it's awesome fun, very geeky, but hell what do I care! What matters more in the world than enjoying yourself with good friends? not much, that I can assure you.
Negative energy, don't we all have some of this within? I would think we would have to considering all of it that surrounds us. Is there a way to completely block it out and if so will it make me a happier person. You see, I am a fairly happy person. I enjoy laughing and being silly and letting the inner child in me come out to play every so often.      So last night I and a few friends were having a little get together. Ya know some jokes a few bottles of wine couple hands of cards. The usual. Well I had heard this news story on the radio earlier in the day that just made me think....wow....Weird. Crazy. So let me enlighten you guys on this rather odd and extremely disgusting news tidbit that fell into my lap while driving.         In some state that I'm unsure of last week there was a dentist who had his license taken away from him for injecting his 'happy juice' into the mouths of his un-suspecting patients, telling them it was a dental rinse, and then asking them to swallow it. Well, apparently a few of the poor women this happened to knew what it was they had just tasted and got together and sued him. Upon a search of the dentists office they found several syringes in his desk drawer full of said 'happy juice'. YUCK!      Ok so the point to that was... my boyfriend walked in the room where me and my friends were all hanging out after he had come out of the bathroom and wiped his wet hand on me. Triggering me to think 'ewwww he just wiped pee on me' which then triggered me to think of the news story I had heard earlier cause it has to do with bodily fluids. So I tell my friends the story, mainly to gross them out as it did me. Then this guy, we will call him John. ( not my friend) starts telling me what a negative person I am and how he doesn't even listen to things like that because he doesn't allow negative energy to consume him. Okay, I am thinking John is a complete fucking moron. I was just sharing a news story. Then he goes into how he has this forcefield around him that no negativity can withstand. To quote him ' It would be like a spitball hitting an airplane.' What the fuck, dude??? By this point everyone is confused now and they all we all just keep saying, Huh? Huh? What? I'm confused.      Sometimes I just do not understand where people are coming from. Maybe someone reading this will understand where he was coming from. If so let me know. Until next time---
I would like to start out with a little explanation as to who I am and why I have created this little corner of my world. Although, I feel like who I am will probably reveal itself to you readers through these blogs more than I could ever explain. So on to why I have created this blog then shall we? I stubbled across this the other day while 'taking a little break' from work. You see I always read the Real World/Road Rules Blog spot. I just love both of those shows, it truely is an obbsesion. So somehow I ended up here and I thought to myself; this would be a neat thing to do. I can truley express real feelings on all kinds of subjects and the worse thing that will happen is no one will read it. Not so bad. I also could use the typing practice and learn a little more about my computer, also. So I am going to learn as I go, hopefully I wont do too bad. I do feel like I should tell a little basic history about myself though so here it is. I was born in Birmingham, Alabama where I grew up living a twisted version of a somewhat normal life until I was 16. At that age I got married ( yes I know 'married at 16, lives in Alabama' I am not that stereotype. Though I do meet all the qualifications!) and stayed married until I was 19 and living in Tampa, Florida. I left my husband and came home to Alabama. Then I met someone and left for Cleveland, Ohio, where I resided for three years and returned back to Alabama at the age of 21. For the past five years I have been living with my boyfriend in our house here in Alabama. I have had all types of jobs and many reasons for the choices I have made. Some not very good ones I will have to admit. However, I would not change a thing. I am mostly happy with the person I am today and where I am at. I do fight inner-battles constanty it seems and struggle with the state of the world and the people in it among many other things. I do not want to overwhelm anyone so thats where Im stopping for today. Till next time------

âThere is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world; there is only the comparison of one state with another.  Only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss.

There she was..Standing there in the middle of the night..All tied up inside because of her problems...No where to go...No one to save her from what she was becoming....Losing her self in the atmosphere...Loosing her self in no ones dreams...Loosing her self in between....Lost...Trying to find her way...Getting nowhere...Trying to find a place...A spot to stop hiding...Start facing what was going on in her life...To start realizing NOTHING was alright...And it was never going to be...Not ever....Never again..To realize..That she had lost it all...
'I walk down the face of this Earth, alone. I am holding no ones hand, and no one is behind me saying keep on going, or keep on moving. When I stumble, when I trip, no one helps me up. I have to get up myself.

There I stood..In that dark cold night...Staring right into those eyes who had been watching me as I walked through that dark...Endless forest....Those eyes that had watched me...That had followed me..All the way through the forest....Then I got lost...That's the only reason I saw the eyes on the first place..I felt watched ever since I entered the forest....But I didn't want to look back...So I just went on...But now...I was lost...I got lost and looked all around...But I stopped in the eyes...Dark eyes...I could only see some little shine on the...But no color...Just shine..And I was freaked...I looked into those eyes..But wasn't scared at all...Those eyes seemed to be admiring me...Meant no harm...But as I looked at them they drank my essence..I didn't feel anything..I just felt tired...But I wasn't tired...I was just dying...Slowly...Maybe too slow to notice what was happening...To really know that I wasn't ok..That my life...My essence was taken away from me...Because I got lost and looked into those eyes...Then I died...After hours of staring...I died...Those eyes took all my Essence...They took my soul...They took all that made me...Well...Me...
I said I had enough...Of you...Of the world..Of everything..Of existence...Of life...It's senseless to be fed up and still have to be..Please something kill me....Now!!...
Never thought I would end up here...Where I was...Lost stranded...But happy....It's that kind of happiness that simply exists and is there for no apparent reason...That happiness that becomes confusing after a while...It's great being happy....But that day it was stranger than ever before..I was happy...Yeah great but then again it had no explanation.-...And I wasn't just happy like any other time that happened...I felt stupid....I laughed at everything and it all seemed great....What the hell was happening to me???....I mean not only the happiness...That almost never happened...WHY??...I mean not only that there was no reason...But that even though I was happy it didn't feel good...But the day went on...As for my conscious side..It went to sleep.....Then I woke up on this room with cushioned walls....What the hell had happened last night??....Why was I in a mental hospital..??..What did I have a straightjacket on??...What had I done??...What the hell was wrong with me?????... Then the doctor came in...He told me I had been killing people...But that I wasn't just killing them...He said I danced with them...Told them how happy They should feel to finally understand the meaning of life....That they should be as happy as me...Then I understood...All those days I had felt *happy* I had woken up in a police station acussed of inappropriate behavior towards other people..I was hurting them...Trying to take their lives away...But I couldn't...Until today...The day I realized that happiness just wasn't meant for me..It wasn't meant to be..I'd prefer being condemned to a life in depression than a minute of happiness in which I ended up killing people...Taking their lives was what made me happy...Keeping them...Even more...But being stuck in that white cushioned room took all the happiness away cuz when insane...It's better to just do what your mind tells you...cuz if u don't...Things get worse...
Reach out..Find air...That's all that went through mi mind at the time...I felt tired...Had no air....Needed some air...To breathe...To live on to continue with this torturing existence...To live on in this pathetic side of the world...The only reason I had was you...And you in my mind always..I had to get over the place I was forced to live in...I had to become someone...Be something to get to you...To reach you....To finally get to be with you....To know myself...Cuz I find myself in you...
I never thought that I wouldn't hurt...I really thought it would...For life....But it just didn't....I thought the pain I was about to feel would change what I was..For ever...But it didn't....The pain of the knife, the pain of death, the pain of suicide...None of that's real...There's no pain at all...Watch as my life fades away from me....Watch me as I stand there...Bleeding....Bleeding like I never had before...The life that I had once had was fading away...Leaving my side...And it was through the blood....That life went away....From me...
Alone..Living by myself living in a world made for those  'sociable' ....Those considered normal...Common....But not for me....I turned out wrong...I went the wrong way around...I'm not a good part of society....Cuz I don't feel like part of any kind of society..Only my own...Not because I'm a bad person or anything like that....What happens is I'm not the same as everyone else...I've got my issues..My stuff..My things that make me feel good..But that seem  *weird*  for the rest of the people..I'm in my own little world....Living by myself..But still I'm happy....Cuz I don't have to be like everybody else to be happy..I just have to be me...
Time stood still as I tried to trace my way in the fog..I've never been so lost..I've been trying to find my way for so long..But now I guess where I am is where I'm supposed to be..This must be home..I was home all along..But home doesn't feel good..It feels..Well...Kinda lost actually..I'm stuck in this war between what I am..And what I want to be..And what I want to be just doesn't make me feel better..So it's awkward..But its where I am and what I am..So that's just it..Good or bad?....Who cares its just me..
..There I Stood In Front Of My Fears..Facing Them..Trying To Overcome Them..But It Was Just To Much To Take..The Lights Faded Away..And So Did I..
actually I'm not entirely dead..Well my body is alive..But I'm not...My soul died..Very long ago...Ever since...Well, it's too long to remember..I believe people see me alive 'cuz its like a burden a have to go trough..Day in, day out of having to be in this fu*ked up place..Having to exist...It sucks ass..Who cares if my language is  *inappropriate* ..You'd say the same if you had to live here...Believe me you would...There's nothing nice...Nothing good about it...To have to go through this...Everyday...I wish I could die entirely..But I cant..I just exist because I have to..There's nothing more to it..And I wish there was just nothing..At all...No existence no living...Not having to be..
...No sense in living..Life has no meaning..But death can't be controlled by the human hand..So.. Suicide just doesn't make it better..Damn is this boring..
I'm cold..Freezing..Lost..Fading away..Feeling alone..Left out..Desperate..It feels bad..But not bad enough to look for you...I'd rather live a life alone than spend 10 minutes with you..I'd rather talk to myself..Invent people...Have imaginary friends..Anything is better than you..I hate you..I wish you had never existed..Never had come into my life to ruin it..I wish I had never been your FRIEND..cuz I was a true one..You were just like any other hypocrite..Trying to get things out from me trying to know my secrets to then make them public..Betray me like any other bitch..But who cares..??..I'm better off without you..And I'm glad to realize what you are..I hate you..Very very much..Please die..You should..Just keep it in mind.. 'later..
Life..Death..//..Somewhere in between..that place where you see those you loved in life..but don't seem to be able to get close to them...to have any kind of contact..you see them...you  feel  them..but they don't..they believe you're dead..and you are..but it doesn't feel like death...you don't even know how death actually feels like because you had things in the world of the living that you didn't do..that's why you're there...stuck in the middle..no sense in trying to go back...cuz there's no way back...
Looking 4 a place...searching 4 a soul....to be just like mine...to like the same things I do...looking 4 you...to come and save me...to take me away from where I now am..to save my soul from me...from what I've become..from THIS....what I am....to take me away from where there's no way back..from where I cant escape..but now...I can't seem to find you..you're not here..and I can't search no more...I'm tired...exhausted of trying to find the one that will never come..now I realize I'm alone...left in pain..left in sorrow..left somewhere in between what is usually called  Good and Evil ...left in a place where I have to decide where I wish to go..but I don't even know what I want....what I wish for..where to go...left or right..'good or bad'...I cant decide...but being where I am isn't better..and I cant decide..
That night was freezing....the cold made me shake....I couldn't find warmth anywhere...I put up a fire....turned on the heating system at home....everything...even made some hot cocoa...which I hate...but I couldn't seem to get hot...or even a little warm...I kept frozen...so I decided to go out...find another place to stay...maybe at a friends' home or something...so I went out...and then...again.....the cold made my life miserable...the car didn't start...the engine was frozen...same as me.....so I walked...I was staying at a house in the mountains....but not that far away from some friends' place....so I went walking...but I got lost..the road had been covered with snow and I had no idea where to go.....then I heard a noise...it came from the trees...I went there and found a little girl...lost..crying...I tried to talk to her...to hold her so that she wouldn't feel cold...but she went away....well not exactly....she just rejected me...and continued crying..I stayed besides that tree....near to the girl...maybe someone would try and save her...and well...I'd be saved to...but she didn't seem to be looking for anyone....she didn't seem to want to go anywhere...then she calmed down...sat besides me...suddenly she pulled out a knife...but not any kind of knife...It was one of those hunter ones....with all sorts of edges...I got kinda scared...and then she did it....she stuck it in me....I screamed...a lot...but no one was there...just that little girl....killling me..she looked at me....into my scared...hurt eyes...all she said was she needed to quench its thirst...I got confused...but didn't care....the pain was unbearable...and had lost the strength to move....to scream...to fight....to breathe....I was dying slowly...with a little girl....who just said she needed to quench its thirst...then when she saw me almost dead...she said...- I'm sorry..but it controls me...I have no life...since I made this decision it has been controlling me...this feeling hasn't left my body..and it will never leave..it needs it....I need it...I'm sorry...believe me I am...but there's just nothing I can do...I was lost...just like you are...but at that time it felt better....it made me feel better...and now...I cant live without it...I just cant and I'm sorry....I'm sorry you had to be the one who had to fulfill its need...for blood... ...at that time I felt some strength coming back...and I was totally confused....What was that girl talking about???.....What was IT???....then I asked her....she looked straight into my eyes....I wanted her to answer fast....fast before I died...she said she couldn't tell me...I begged for an answer...I needed it....all she said was if she told me she couldn't let me die....and I tried to smile...and asked her..again...to tell me.....to please tell me and save my life...but she said it had been because of that intrigue that she was where she now was....lost and trying to escape...she said shed rather let me die...than save my life...so that I didn't have to go through what she was going...but anything felt better that death at that time....and I told her I didn't want to die...she said she had warned me.....but that it had been my choice...and I was going to regret it...very much.....but I didn't care...so she did it...she  *saved*  me.....by making me drink my own blood....it felt disgusting...and everything became silent....I fell asleep...I woke up...at night...again....but I felt no more cold...the night was the same as the one before...but I only felt strong...the cut the little girl had made me...Didn't hurt....at all....it had even healed off....perfectly...in one day....I freaked out...What had she done to me???...What had she turned me into...and....where was she????....seeing as I has stronger than I had ever been and the cold didn't bother me...I began to look for her....I searched everywhere....but couldn't find her.....then I felt this urge....this need....I craved for blood.....human blood....but I wasn't like the average vampire....I craved for it...but I also needed the meat...I remembered the little girl giving me some she had saved from another body....it tasted great....and made me feel strong.....stronger than I ever had felt....and...even though I knew it wasn't normal....I went looking for someone.....to eat....while I was /hunting/ I looked into my pockets....there was a knife....same as the one I had been cut with...it was new...well it seemed new...and clean...in perfect condition...it was perfect for what I needed....and I found the perfect victim....a young woman....who's car had broken down...I was looking at her...from in between the trees..and I came out....walked towards her...looking snobbish and interesting....she looked at me and asked for some help..I said I'd help her.....but the need grew stronger....I couldn't even act as if I didn't want to kill her...to eat her...to drink her....so I just took the knife y stuck it into her stomach...she was in pain...same as I had been the night before...but I didn't care...I wasn't like that little girl.....I didn't ask for the woman to forgive me...I just killed her....took her into the woods..and ate her.....drank her blood...feasted on her meat...and fell asleep...I woke up the next morning...even stronger than before....but my conscious wasn't clean...I remebered everything....to the slightest detail....it felt horrible....I had killed and eaten another human being...but I was no longer human...I didn't know what I was...I looked human...but there was something in me that had changed...and now I understand what the little girl had been saying....how I was gonna regret making that decision...and I did..I regret it...too much...now I know what IT was...she was young..and didn't know what she was feeling..she called IT the urge she felt....the need for human flesh and blood...and now there's no way back.....suicide just doesn't work....eating other people makes you stronger.....strong enough not to die...and now I have to live with this....without having the strength to control myself..to end this up....because IT moves me...IT controls me...and I'm not like any other cannibal...there's something more to it...something that cannot be explained...something that's stronger than me and that has taken over me...a dark force...that took the human away...and turned in the beast..
So..then again, why am I ten feet under??..
Death..My perfect state...That simple point where reality is a dream...A nightmare once lived...A simple memory that comes back to torment our soul...A place where no one wants to go back to...A point where everything seems worse that it is..Everything makes sense and it all sucks!...You stand in a point in which everything you do has a consequence...Everything takes you somewhere else..Somewhere worse than before...All of this shit that doesn't exist when Dead...Death is a rest...A simple lay back...Plain relaxation....A stage in which there is nothing..At all....An empty play..No actors..No actresses...Not even a back stage crew...Simple emptiness...No feelings...No dreams...No memories...No LIFE...

Blake has lured you into this dark alleyway. As you wait for your eyes to adjust, you feel something brush against your neck. There is a slight popping noise, of fangs sinking into your veins. You are paralysed, while the blood drains from your body. As the fangs retract, you feel a new strength, and a new coldness in your limbs. You have joined the ranks of the undead.
...Once again I'm feeling hole...Empty...Useless.... ...I wish for this life to just go...go away vanish.... -I wanna go now...Can you PLEASE show me the way???....There's no way out now...Is it???...Damn...Oh well....Now what???....I'm bored of living in a world where NO ONE is true....Hypocrisy works!!..It's a good plan.....When you know how to pull it off right....Acting works..It helps a lot in getting shit......In getting shit into people's minds....To deceive them.....As we both once said....You only see what they want you to see...Never will you know who someone REALLY is...You just see what they want you to see....I guess you've shown enough now.....I'm not gonna beg anyone to be my friend.....It should be for your own will not mine.....You are someone else...I am still right here......You've changed..I know.....I guess you've told me so...Is that all you want???....Oh, no wonder you're talking to me again....I should've expected for that....For something to go wrong AGAIN...And I actually did....But now..I'm tired to trying.....trying to make things right again...Just trying...I'm fed up with that shit.....cuz that's all it is...Shit!.....
'Through me the way into the suffering city, Through me the way to the eternal pain, Through me the way that runs among the lost.

By: TIRI!!!    I was sitting in the police station when someone called and reported a dead body in an apartment in Malibu Street. I was stuck with a lot of work but when I heard the name of the dead person I couldnât resist taking the case. It was a guy that had been my friend in high school I just needed to know what had happened.  I went to this house, was huge, I entered the room and I saw the body lying out there, I thought how could it be possible that a person could kill somebody that special. I started investigating and picking up evidence, in that moment I saw some papers and the phone miss placed, placed on a table that was beside the bed, they were all disorganized like if he trying to get the phone had disorganized them. I came up to the table and there was a name that caught my attention Jane Warrens, she was a girl that studied with us in high school, there was an address and a phone number. It made me think about why Stewart had this information, so I decided to investigate more deeply. This was because I knew that he had a crush on her since she knew her and the last time I talked to him he still thought about her. So I made my people check his phone bill; his accounts and thinks that could take me to some idea to start looking for a suspect. When I had all the results I noticed that the name Jane Warrens appeared in most of the phone calls he made. I decided to investigate her more deeply. I went to her house and in the moment she saw me she didnât recognize me, but then when I presented my self she knew who I was. We started talking about how life was going for both of us and in between the chatting I told her about Stewartâs death. She seamed surprised and with the look of her face I started doubting about if she that was so sweet could kill somebody. Then I met her husband, Mathew, a tall and strong man. He was really kind to me and I didnât waist my opportunity to ask him what he knew about this murder in this moment a saw his reaction, he was really nervous and he didnât know what to answer. I started to suspect of him but I didnât tell them anything. First I investigated Mathewâs life and see what he did for a living and how he spent his days for the last 2 months. In between months there was a week where he got out of work and he didnât leave a message were he could be found, I started suspecting. I started comparing information about the two guys lives and about things that had happened through that time. I noticed something strange, in those two weeks that Mathew had left him office with out leaving a message; his wife had been receiving some messages and some roses from another guy. This made my suspects more accurate. Mathew had been spying on her husband since the first letter arrived and when he discovered that his wife was cheating on him he decided to kill him.  One week went by and now I had all the evidence I needed to take Mathew to the police station to make him some questions. I went to their house and I asked Jane were he was. He wasnât at home, she told me he was working and asked me what was wrong, I told her about the evidences I found and she freaked out but I couldnât talk to her I had to get the guy as soon as possible. I went to his office and there he was, talking on the phone so calmed and sure of himself, but when I entered and he looked at me he freaked out and left the phone drop. I told him he had to accompany me to the police station that I had some questions for him. He said that he was mistaken that he had nothing to do with the murder but still I made him come with me.  At the police station I told him what was wrong and why I had called him to ask him some questions. He felt so confused like if he didnât know what I was talking about it made me doubt, but I still asked him all sort of questions. After a while of talking and asking question he told me the truth, the whole story. We went into my office so he could feel more comfortable, we sat down, and then he started talking.   âTwo months ago I was on a business trip, closing a really important deal for the company. I was away for two weeks and a half and when I came back I noticed that my wife was behaving really strange with me. At first I didnât care I thought that she had a lot of stress on her because around that time she was organizing a family party that was really important. A week went by, the party was over and I still noticed that behavior. I started to suspect that something was wrong, she came late at night saying that she was with her sister or with a friend talking about further parties and events they were planning to do, but that became so often that I started to investigate. One night I went to her momâs house and I saw that her sister was there, when before in that day she had told me that she was spending the day with her sister. It was strange but I thought that she could be with a friend, or that by that time she was going home and we didnât cross over in the way. I returned home expecting to see her there but she wasnât. 30 minutes later she entered and when she saw me in the couch waiting for her she started to act really nervous. I told her where she was and she told me she was with her sister. From there I knew something was wrong the next night I decided to follow her. She drove over to an apartment, I didnât now from who it was, from all the friends that she had and that I knew no one lived there. I freaked out, but I said to my self not to panic that maybe she had a client for another party. I waited out side until she came out. When she left I decided to go up stairs and see who it was she was with. It was a guy I had never seen before, so I started to suspect that she was cheating on me. I didnât ask her anything when I got home neither she asked me where I was.â  This made me suspect even more about Mathew and I told him that if from what he was telling me he didnât think I was going to suspect even more. He told me to listen to him. So I did. âThe next day when I went out for the news paper I saw roses beside it. There was a letter saying âTo my dearest and beautiful love, Hope you like them and see you soon, love, SKâ I picked up the newspaper and the roses I didnât mentioned anything at breakfast and neither did she. The next three day I followed her and she went always to the same place and every day I asked her where she was and every day she told me she was with somebody arranging things for some parties. The fourth day I followed her until the 5th floor where this guy lived I saw her kiss him as soon as he opened the door from there I suspected what was happening next. I felt betrayed, failed, I felt so bad I didnât know what to do. I went down; I jumped in my car and drove away without course. The next day she was acting as she did before all sweet and beautiful as the day we got married, but from what I knew I was the one acting strange. I decided I was focusing more on my work and let her drown herself until she had to tell me the truth even though I was furious and wanted to kill the guy. For the following week and a half I dedicated my body and soul to work because there was a mayor problem with the deal I had make like a month before, so I had to go out and make some things to straighten things up and thatâs why I didnât left messages, because we didnât want no body to know what was going on and it was a really huge deal that maybe the company could loose a lot of money. So we wanted to stay shut. I knew about the murder the day after it was committed and when I saw you come in to out home I was pretty nervous because two day before Stewart was killed Jane went out late at night with the roses that arrived that day, it seemed like if she was trying to free her self from it so I didnât notice but well I had already notice a long time ago. The day the murder was committed was the last day the roses arrived. That night I went out with some of my colleagues to celebrate the success in closing up the deal and having solved all the problems we had. I was almost mid-night when I went home, when I was parking my car, Janeâs car stationed beside. I suspected that she had gone to see him; I was so furious that I got in my car and told her I had forgotten something at the office that was really important. I got into the car and drove to this guyâs apartment I was really mad, I went to talk to him I knocked on the door but there was no answer. I knocked several times and then decided to through the door down. When I opened the door I found him lying on the floor with blood all over the place, I touched his neck to see if he had a pulse but he was gone. So that was when I called the police and reported the murder, and thatâs the whole storyâ I was shocked on what I just have heard. How could I have been so blind not suspecting of her first. She trying to incriminate her husband saying that he came in late without saying where he was and all sorts of actions that he was supposedly doing but the truth was that she was the one doing them. In that precise moment I stepped out of the office and went for and order to arrest this woman.  We went to her house and told her to come with us she was resisting and saying she had nothing to do with what had happened. But still forced we made her accompany us.  Right back at the police station we placed her in a room to ask her some questions. She didnât want to answer and we couldnât obligate her to talk. So I decide to look for another method. I asked Mathew to talk to her and he accepted. He entered the room and as soon she saw him she felt so guilty for making him go through what he had gone that she confessed everything. She murdered Stewart Kent. The roses were all fake, she sent them herself to make it seem like if it was a guy that was obsessed with her, and that she was having an affair. She made this be so obvious to his husband so he noticed that she was having an affair and he went to kill the guy for stilling his wife. In the end she saw that her husband didnât care so she decided to murder him herself but leaving evidence that seemed as if her husband had killed him. She also said that the affair never happened that the made it up just because she was angry with him because he didnât close a huge deal for a party from where she could get a great amount of money she could use to pay a debt that she had. We let Mathew out; he had his face red and his eyes full of tears. He was so sad. We told him that everything was going to be o.k now that she had confessed. He asked me what was going to happen to her and I told him that because she had accepted the crime and claimed herself guilty maybe the judge could conceder the penalty. He thanked me about everything. I walked him to the door and shake his had. Again he said thank you  and with his soul in deep pain and tears running down his face I saw him walk away and jump into his car and drive away.

My Dearest:  I've missed you very very much since that last night we were together and will hold that night specially in my memories for years to come. I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately, I've read your letter through at least four times, and would probably read it more times before I'm through. I've been sitting here, looking at your picture and getting more home sick every minute.  I've wanted that picture more than anything else i known of except, of course...you, yourself. I keep thinking of you darling, keep wishing I could be home with you. I want to leave in the worse possible way so I can come home to see you but...things don't look so good on that subject. This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone I guess, I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now. I'm completely lost without you darling. I never realized i could miss any one person so much.  I just can't wait too much longer until I'm able to be with you again..  And live a sane and normal life.  Hidden Track. 'Violence' Blink 182
..they sink and they drown 2 mins before they hit the ground...so i feel this is coming to and end..are gonna be there 'till then??..so we talk...we say forever not knowing how long it is...we say forever and promises brake before they're made..we say forever and we go...we leave and forever brakes!..  ..we sometimes believe in things that seem perfect...perfection ain't perfect and that as a fact can be easily proved. looking for completeness..fullfillment, joy! for this fake concept of total hapiness that gets easily overwhelmed by despair, it dies and so do most of our souls..they die looking..still trying to find out a reason...
Am I freak in the darkness, or am I misfit? You speak them opinions to sink in so deep. But its alright, you're just an illusion confused by your narrow mind. Reality is up ahead in tha' distance, but that lack of persistance has left you behind. Now your reaching for your sanity, cause you're afraid of me, so don't fuck with me. You wanna ask me a question? Well I gotta question. How much longer can I tolerate this shit. Egos trip when your livin' on tha' flip-side. Drop out of a uterus and died, damn. I see ya' pointin' your finger, ya' stereotype me cause you don't like me? Well you don't even know me, punk. You don't know me. Stereotype me, cause you don't like me!! &nbsp; urlLink

By: TIRI!!(all rights reserved)  Bill Moritz, known as the kidnapped boy, was a guy that had big expectations in his life, he wanted to finish school to go to university and study what he like best, ecology. He was a boy that liked exploration and he always said that he will dedicate all his life to go on adventures all around the world doing what he liked most, climbing. He had a great childhood, but when he was an adolescent he had a bad incident, he was kidnapped and kept for almost a year. But even though he had this bad experience in the past he had dreams of going to the highest mountains and reaching the top. Actually one of his adventures happened two weeks ago, when he decided to make a journey to El Cocui Snow Mountain. He was so excited he couldnât wait one more day; he packed and got organized and left everything ready for his trip. Finally, the perfect and expected wild day arrived. He got on his car turned the radio on and left the station where they were giving the new because he wanted to know how the climate was on the area. Few minutes latter he stopped surprised of what he had heard over the news. He was really worried and scared, âThe Cocui was filled up with guerrilla and the kidnap statistics was of a 90% probability.â But even though he was scared and not really sure if he should continue, he filled with courage and carried on with his dream.  The next day he arrived to one of the most dangerous mountain of El Cocui, named La Laguna de los Verdes. Bill started to feel and smell the soft and comfortable aroma of the wind and he saw the beautiful colors of nature; he felt so secure and happy, he knew that he was where he belonged, free and in peace. After a moment he heard a really strange noise that made him come back to reality and remember his past and what he had heard the day before. He was frightened, he felt as if he were living a flashback. He heard some gunshots, he was frightened, he didnât know what to do he was paralyzed; he just wished he had returned when he had the chance. He started to run in no direction and after a while of running he ended up in a dark and endless cave. He didnât notice that in the cave there was some ice blocks falling from the top and that in the floor there were some human footsteps, so he continued walking knowing that there he would be secure. After a while of walking, he heard some screaming; they came from far away, it seemed to be from a girl, a KIDNAPPED girl, who was screaming for help. He continued walking and when he least expected he was eye covered and he felt that someone grabbed his arm and painfully twisted it to his back, he felt as it thy were taking his arm away. He heard a manâs voice ordering him to walk, but because he was so scared it seemed difficult to do it. After a while of not knowing to where he was taken, he heard the girlsâ voice again. Every time the girl voice got closer, and closer. Then instantaneously the bandage was off and he had the chance to look down and when he did he saw a small girl. The man made him sit down beside her and ordered him to stay quiet. Even though the man told him not to, he talked for a while with the girl letting the time pass and the night to arrive. When it did arrived he didnât remember falling a sleep. At some point in the middle of the night he woke up all sweaty. He was home, in his bed and the day of his journey hadnât arrived. He realized that he was living a lie, everything was ok when he figured out what had happened he calmed down, nothing was happening. He would be living tomorrow and his trip was going to be the first of so many trips to come.

Kevin got an email from the sportswear place asking his salary range.  Although unscrupulous, I intercepted this email via webmail and replied with a 25k-30k requirement, citing that the last job held paid 28k with benefits.  After sending this email, I let it remain in the inbox to be downloaded to his outlook.  As predicted, he saw the email and wanted to respond to it with a 25-30k requirement.  I am good.  So while he was indisposed in the shitter, I made a dummy email that said the same thing and sent it to a dummy email addy.  It was bounced back undeliverable, but I deleted it from the inbox and deleted mail box so he'll never know the difference.  When he came back in from the bathroom, he read the sent copy and was satisfied with the reply.  Not that he should actually send his own stuff.  I made the resume.  I wrote the cover letter.  I found the job.  I applied him for it.  Then he has the audacity to tell me he has to do everything because I ask him to bring me something from the kitchen while he is up and already in the kitchen.  Hmmmm.  He better get this friggin job because I'll be god damned if I have to sell my car so we can get by and I have to drive a junk piece of shit even though I make a ton of money.  Sad, but true, I have to pay for every bill, plus my debt, rent, car payment, vacation fund (which I made a separate one for me) pet costs, food, EVERYTHING.  He even asked if I could use my credit card to buy him toys.  What?  I don't think so asshole.  If I have to do without some things I like, so do you.  I'm contemplating giving up my car, that I worked hard for, but you want to go on buying fucking toys?!  Not going to happen!

In September of 1996, I was backpacking through Israel when I landed in the northern hill town of Tzfat (AKA Safed).  Tzfat is the epicenter of Jewish mysticism and has become a...wait for it...Mecca for people interested in living a thoroughly Jewish life, complete with exhaustive ritual and worship, but with a focus on the more esoteric teachings of  urlLink Kabbalah , rather than the more literal Judaism prevelent in Jerusalem.  Often, people arrive in Tzfat wanting to merely dabble, but end up moving there and dramatically changing their lives.  For lodging I stayed at a hostel run by an Orthodox Jewish organization providing free shelter in exchange for attendance at religious education classes held several times a day.  It's no secret that many Jewish tourists traveling around Israel have a sometimes hidden (sometimes not) agenda to have some kind of religious or spiritual experience while in the Holy Land, especially Jews from the U.S. where spirituality is mostly marginalized.  After all, when you return from a trip to Israel, you will invariably be asked by many people whether or not anything happened, and by the way the question is formed, you know they're not asking whether or not you got sick from eating too many dates.    In Tzfat, something happened, but I've only recently figured out what it was.  I had already been through Jerusalem and had prayed at the holiest Jewish site in the world, the  urlLink Western Wall , the remnants of the Holy Temple destroyed by the Romans in 68 C.E.  While it was indeed an incredible place to visit, and while I did feel the weight of history and the echoes of millions of prayers thick in the air, I came away feeling like something was missing, as if I was supposed to have had a catharsis or awakening.  Indeed, nothing so dramatic happened during my entire visit.  And so I came to Tzfat a bit let down, but not without hope that I'd pick up something of spiritual value.  It was in that spirit that I attended a morning class with a Rabbi whose name, sadly, never stuck with me.    We spent the entire hour talking about the first line of the Book of Genesis.  Well, at least the Rabbi tried to contain the discussion to the first line, quoting commentary written over hundreds of years, analyzing every word in that first sentence.  Every word, of course, had numerous possible meanings as there is a great deal of interpretation that comes with translating from Hebrew.  So, I thought this level of scrutiny was a green light for me to ask a question about the rest of the creation story, a question that had bugged me for years.   hjm: Rabbi, do you really believe that heaven and earth were created in 6 days?  Six days as we know them now?  Six twenty-four hour days?  Rabbi: Yes, I do.    hjm: What about modern interpretations that suggest the possibility that each of those 6 days actually lasted millions of years?  Rabbi: No. They were twenty-four hour days, just as we experience them today.  hjm: So, you actually believe that is has only been 5,755 years since heaven and earth were created.  Rabbi: Yes.  hjm: What about science?  What about carbon date testing that shows fossils to be millions of years old?  Rabbi:  Scientists believe what they want to believe, and I believe what I want to believe.   On the surface, there was nothing remarkable about this Rabbi.  He wore the traditional black and white clothes, his hair and beard were characteristically unkempt, he was probably not that much older than me, but he'd forgotten more about Judaism than I had ever learned.  In hindsight, what I realize now as significant was the utter sincerity, the quiet conviction, the peacefulness he exuded, comforted by his faith and under no pressure whatsoever to justify it to anyone.  Sure, he taught the classes in hopes that others might share the rewards of his faith.  Yet, he had no desire to force his views on anyone.    So, it strikes me how different he was from other people I have met who profess a deep, passionate faith.  It has been my misfortune to have more than once been confronted by religious zealotry, an entirely different practice in faith with a very different presentation.  The zealot seems driven more by desperation than anything else.  They have seen the light and operate from a place of panic, feeling that they are personally responsible for the salvation of others.    For years after my trip, I liked to tell the story about that Rabbi, and it is with some degree of shame that I realize that I actually took delight in pointing out what, until now, seemed like the worst kind of blind faith, the shunning of fundamental scientific discoveries in favor of a literal interpretation of a document, The Bible, that scientists and scholars have made few solid conclusions about.  I got a lot of mileage with that anecdote and missed the point completely.  In the end, it was more important that the Rabbi was benevolent than whether or not he was right about the origins of the universe.  One can have all the faith in the world, but if he/she does not practice tolerance towards fellow humans who have their own version of faith, if they are motivated by desperation rather than love, then not only are they are in no position to be prosletyzing, but they are hardly models of an enlightened being, totally incapable of demonstrating the benefits of faith.

Josh Marshall made a  urlLink  post   to his blog last night that is very tempting to believe. He talks about the tone of the Democratic National Convention as being starkly different from the tone of the campaign amongst the candidates for the nomination.  Much has been said in the media about how the rhetoric of the DNC has been surprisingly light in terms of attacks on the Bush Administration, and Josh offers his explanation in two points:   First:   On the surface, the fiery rhetoric and animus of 2003 and early 2004 were directed at President Bush. And to some degree of course they were. But the punch of that rhetoric derived not so much from Democrats' antipathy for President Bush as from a pitched battle, almost a rebellion, within the Democratic party -- the grassroots of the Democratic party insisting that Washington Democrats were compromising with the president over particulars when he was leading the country in a direction that had to be opposed across the board. Fiery rhetoric against President Bush was fiery rhetoric against compromise and accommodation with him. In other words, it was to a very real degree aimed at other Democrats.    Second:   Anger is often, and rage is almost always, an emotion rooted in powerlessness. That was certainly the position of Democrats in early 2003 (on so many levels), though less so as the year went on. These Democrats don't feel powerless. The mood is one of cautious optimism that they can drive the president from office, that the wind is at their backs.   So, Josh thinks the change in tone is a sign of unity and optimism.  That certainly is a glass-half-full way to interpret it.  Yet, while I'd rather be optimistic, the polls showing Bush and Kerry in a dead heat, despite the glaring fact that the Bush Administration has dragged this country through the gutter, erode my ability to believe that the Democratic Party has what it takes to beat the Republicans.  What Josh sees as a new found confidence, I see as fearful, tip-toe dancing around the swing voters.    The point that anger is 'almost always' rooted in powerlessness, while likely true, rules out the potent combination of anger and confidence, righteous indignation, that occasionally surfaces during struggles for freedom and justice.  As a model, I look to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  MLK spoke the plain truth and there was no way to hide the legitimate anger he felt about racism.  He had utter confidence that he was right and deep faith that he would succeed.  I find it deeply ironic that the most successful movies in America are blockbuster action films with heroes who act out of righteous indignation.  It is a classic American icon, yet somewhere along the line the Democratic Party decided that this formula doesn't work.  Yes, the media jumped all over Howard Dean for his post-Iowa pep rally.  The key, however, was how the Dean campaign, and the Democrats in general, reacted.  Rather than defend the emotion that Dean was showing, which I contend was much more that of enthusiasm than anger, they apologized and toned it down.  This is classic pacification, and the worst part is that it is self-inflicted.
urlLink The New York Times > Week in Review > What Boston Can Do for Kerry : 'Yet for all that, the American convention remains a singular moment in the nominating process - a relic of a bygone time, perhaps, but a relic that nonetheless keeps driving the story line of a presidential election. And that is no small matter for John Kerry, the likely Democratic nominee.  Mr. Kerry will head to Boston - where the convention begins next Monday - remembering and trying to duplicate Mr. Clinton's success. Americans do not seem overly enthused about him. If polls showing him tied with Mr. Bush are to be believed,  Mr. Kerry has so far been unable to take advantage of abundant evidence that Americans are looking for a change in the White House.   Mr. Kerry's advisers say that it is not that voters don't like him; it is that they still do not know him, even after $80 million worth of television advertisements, close to 50 candidate debates and almost two years of campaigning. Yet Mr. Kerry's aides see these polls, and are clearly hungering for these four days in Boston to break this deadlock, preparing with a level of intensity and detail that serves as the ultimate validation of the power of conventions.'  This year, the Democratic National Convention is taking place merely for Big Dems to glad hand one another and for some Little Dem wannabes to wait for the party to collapse.   What is emphasized above I stated was Kerry's electability problem back in February/March (not here but elsewhere as t-floss hadn't been around then). Back then I was even leaning to voting for Bush if the Democratic National Party allowed the early primaries to elect a candidate who may have been winning the party faithful but had no chance of winning over the Democratic population at large. Sooner or later (with Kerry it may very well be later), the Dems need to wake up and realize they are flailing about in an identity crisis. That they have allowed themselves to become Republicans in dress and Democrats in name only is shameful. The Democratic Party needs an overhaul. Badly. Gore losing to Bush was plenty evidence. How many more Senators must they run out there to be slaughtered?  As many others opine, Americans do recognize that Bush has his failings, but many of those same Americans look at Kerry and wonder. And think, ummm, that's a haggard Al Gore with a big coif. The insincerity meter runs high around Kerry in comparison to Bush. And that meter often sways elections (no, really, it does!). Bush may be a word-fumbling dolt on stage but he's a sincere word-fumbling dolt on and off stage. Voters who have doubts will go for the sincere incumbent every time no matter how much he bungled things.   Kerry? Unlike rabble-rouser Howard Dean and his yyyyyyyyahp!ing, which in the long run  would  have been a positive, Kerry has said and done nothing to convince those 'looking for a change' to look his way.    It has been 52 years since a convention really chose the candidate - when Democrats in Chicago nominated Adlai Stevenson. Over the next 40 years, conventions became the stage for presenting a running mate, as a way of keeping some interest in the event. Even that little gift of news has slipped away over the years; Mr. Kerry selected Mr. Edwards three weeks before the convention. Granted, the conventions are more about rallying and grooming but never (?) before were the early primary returns allowed to run roughshod over the entire primary process. The West Coast complains about early returns on the East Coast affecting elections, well, what about primaries?!   Thankfully, Edwards was named to the ticket. If it wasn't for him, I'd be voting same as I did in 1976, Mickey and Minnie Mouse.   Don't expect the DNC to change that matter. That is unless the Big Dems wisely allow John Edward to run the show from here on out. He is capable of reaching those seeking change. He is positive and upbeat. Kerry is a reminder of the past. A reminder of the shell the Democratic Party has become. Edwards is the future. Stumping will return. Speechmaking will return. But the candidate must be earnest. He must not be afraid to make mistakes. Kerry? Copies GW's advertising and doesn't differentiate himself in the least. He wouldn't want to do something the focus groups don't approve. He's a deer in the headlights. Rather, a deer in the bed of the Grand Ol Party's hemi.   This is jek and I approved this blog.  P.S. Edwards/Kerry

This will likely be my last post until Monday, July 19th, as I will be on a road trip with my family around the Selkirk Mountains, and I don't have a laptop.  Oh, the shame!

I'm watching you, Mr. Moore.  2.   urlLink Saturn's rings .    Scientist believe Saturn's rings formed a few hundred million years ago when debris from colliding comets and moons was drawn into orbit around the planet by its gravitational influence.  I read this to a co-worker and she said it's pretty funny to her how scientists think they can really determine that a few hundred million years ago, given the vastness of space, that comets, which on earth we only get to see every 50 years or so, actually collided with moons and the debris resulted in the rings.  Science or science fiction?  3.   urlLink Sticks and stones will break my bones ...   I took real pleasure in reading about the sound ass-whoopin' the Bush administration received at a recent benefit concert that raised $7.5 million.   After celebrities raised $7.5 million with a concert for Democratic candidates John Kerry and John Edwards , an angry Bush campaign challenged their opponents on Friday to release a videotape showing performers calling the president a 'liar' and a 'cheap thug' during the show.  Actor Chevy Chase drew laughs and cheers from the Radio City Music Hall audience when he described politicians and their hobbies: 'Clinton plays the sax, John plays the guitar, and the president's a liar.' John Mellencamp sang 'Let me tell you a story about the Texas Bandito,' a tune that referred to Bush as a 'cheap thug.'  'If John Kerry is going to praise last night's star-studded hate fest and characterize it as the 'heart and soul' of America, he should share these values with voters everywhere,' Bush-Cheney campaign manager Ken Mehlman said Friday in a statement. 'We call on Kerry to release the video of this event so that all Americans can see what John Kerry has called America's 'heart and soul.''   The Bushies hate bullies.  Now  that's  funny!
Josh Marshall's got a  urlLink post  up today about news from Afghanistan concerning a mercenary of sorts who  '...was arrested with others for conducting a 'self-appointed counterterrorism mission that included abusing eight inmates in a private jail by hanging them by their feet.''   Josh goes on to question what someone is doing operating a private jail, especially since it is very unclear who, if anyone, hired him.    His last paragraph reads:   It just seems like someone must have been paying this guy to do something, unless it's like a blog where you just set up shop and figure that someday a revenue stream might turn up.   Sure, I see the intended humor, but I find myself very uncomfortable with the comparison.    All in all, a disturbing story if you choose to follow the link to the ABCNEWS.com  urlLink page  it appears on.  Makes me think of all those movie moments when a CIA agent or Special Forces soldier is given an assignment, and when he is told that the mission is top secret, he responds,  'What mission, sir?'
urlLink Wilco  has another great album out ( urlLink A Ghost is Born ), there's a lead story on Wilco and Jeff Tweedy in  urlLink Rolling Stone , and still so few people, it seems, appreciate what Wilco has accomplished.    From their inception and through the masterpiece  urlLink Summerteeth  , Wilco were master chefs, taking ingredients from their myriad influences and whipping them up into the yummiest of delicacies.   Homage  is a word that often comes to mind when listening to Wilco, since the musical references are so overt that it is impossible to label them as rip-offs.    Yet, what is most remarkable about the band is what they have done in their last two albums -  urlLink Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  and now A Ghost is Born.  What we've seen, or perhaps more appropriately heard, has been the metamorphosis from a band of masterful interpreters of classic pop/rock/country music, to the creators of their very own, unique sound.  Yes, the influences are still there, but they are now relegated to background filler or the occasional, brief keyboard or guitar lick.    It will be very exciting to watch where they will go from here.
I don't know whether to be amused or disturbed by this  urlLink article  in Tuesday's (7/6/04) Washington Post.  On the surface it seems like a simple look at how silly things get in the world of domain names.  Six years ago, an Indianapolis bail bondsman, Kerry Edwards, created his own web domain -  urlLink www.kerryedwards.com .  According to the article, the day it was announced that Sen. John Edwards would be Kerry's running mate, Indianapolis Edwards was called by the Kerry campaign to discuss purchase of the domain name.  Apparently, the asking price was too high.  So, it seems like a fairly harmless, humorous human interest story.  Right?  Reading on we learn about other cybersquatters who have purchased domain names, hoping to cash in:   Other obvious choices for a campaign Web site â KerryEdwards04.com, KerryEdwards2004.com, KerryEdwards-2004.com and KerryEdwards2004.net â have already been registered, according to publicly available Internet records.   Yet, the disturbing part comes in this disclosure by one of these hopeful opportunists, Kevin Draftz of Chicago:   Draftz said his first choice of buyers is the Kerry campaign, but would not rule out selling them to the competition.   And we, or at least I, wonder what is wrong with democracy in America.    It's for sale.

Both have their  urlLink plusses and minuses  but both work well once you get used to them. Currently, I am trying to get used to Firefox and how it ain't so Google friendly (takes an extra click to access some of my favorite features like Blog This!, News, Images, Search This Site, etc. (Well, that's what I call the features. Google prolly has other, longer names.) Opera is fast but too many sites are 'slightly' incompatible with it. And for quasi-neatniks, it can drive them batty.  If you don't have anti-virus protection, get  urlLink some . And if you get a buttload of spam, it is your own damn fault. You're too liberal. With where you poke your head. Porn and shopping and sites will be the death of your PC and/or your time.   If you are looking for a new media player, then I suggest  urlLink Media Center .  urlLink iTunes  (nearing 100M songs sold, BTW) is for kids. At least on Windows. It has too few features to be worth using. RealPlayer is for databases that need rebuilding and people who restart their PC several times a day. No link provided. If you are that stupid,  urlLink here .  urlLink Windows Media Player  is anti-mp3.  urlLink WinAmp  is for skin dweebs.  urlLink MusicMatch  is a better RealPlayer.  File this under: it's 1:27 AM and I've not posted squat here. Plus, I see Howard has simplified the look and wanted to let him know: Good job!  P.S.  urlLink Molly got WordPress! , which is where my 'poisonal' blog is going once I crawl out from under CSS and XHTML and  urlLink design guru wars .  Note to self: if I'd manage my time better, I'd... No, if I focused more, my time would not cover more yet not as much.  urlLink If that makes sense .  P.P.S. This blog appears different when viewed by MSIE (like the Blogger screenshot) or Firefox (no 'graphics', squared corners, poor type handling). Will be testing Opera soon.
Spare the Rod, Save the Child Missouri's youth prisons focus on small groups, therapy, caring. Officials in California's punishment-oriented system are taking a look.   By Jenifer Warren Times Staff Writer  July 1, 2004  ST. JOSEPH, Mo. â There are no handcuffs, no razor-wire fences, no uniforms, no cells. Missouri does things differently in its prisons for young people, and it shows â in what you see and what you don't.  Inmates, referred to as 'kids,' live in dorms that feature beanbag chairs, potted plants, stuffed animals and bunk beds with smiley-face comforters. Guards â who are called 'youth specialists' and must have college degrees â go by their first names and don't hesitate to offer hugs.  At the maximum-security lockup in St. Joseph, two cats, Midnight and Tigger, curl up on laps as the state's toughest teenage offenders explore the roots of their anger, weep over the acts of abusive parents and swap strategies for breaking free of gangs. At another facility in Kansas City, boys who rack up months of good behavior earn the right to attend summer basketball camp.  'The old corrections model was a failure; most kids left us worse off than when they came in,' said Mark Steward, the chief of Missouri's youth penal system. 'So we threw away that culture, and now we focus on treatment, on making connections with these guys and showing them another wayâ¦. It works.'    urlLink This  is a must read, but it requires free registration, sorry.
Very interesting  urlLink stuff  brewing in the African-American community.  Just when you thought it was the politically correct thing to do as a white male, to blame racism for the ongoing struggles of blacks in America, Bill Cosby upsets the apple cart and says there's no excuse.   During Thursday's speech, Cosby said his detractors were not facing the facts about poor black communities and were just trying to cover up what he called their 'dirty laundry.'   'Let me tell you something, your dirty laundry gets out of school at 2:30 every day, it's cursing and calling each other n----r as they're walking up and down the street,' he said.   Cosby continued railing about the state of black youth in America. 'They think they're hip,' he said. 'They can't read; they can't write. They're laughing and giggling, and they're going nowhere.'   To African-American men, Cosby ranted, 'Stop beating up your women because you can't find a job.'   He complained about rap music: 'When you put on a record, and that record is yelling 'n----r this' and 'n----r that' and cursing all over the thing and you got your little six-year-old and seven-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car--those children hear that. And I am telling you when you put the CD on and then you get up and dance to it What are you saying to your children?'   And he also ripped into sitcoms targeting African-American audiences: 'Comedians coming on TV [saying,] 'I am so ugly, you are ugly, yuck, yuck.' That's all minstrel show stuff. I am tired of it.'   'I can't even talk the way these people talk, 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is'...and I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk,' Cosby said in May. 'And then I heard the father talk...Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth.'   On Thursday, Cosby further elaborated his thoughts on the subject, saying once again that white people aren't to blame for teen pregnancy and high-school dropout rates.   'For me there is a time...when we have to turn the mirror around,' he said. 'Because for me it is almost analgesic to talk about what the white man is doing against us. And it keeps a person frozen in their seat, it keeps you frozen in your hole you're sitting in.'    Easier said than done coming from a very wealthy man?  I don't know.  Does he minimize the very real impact of ongoing racism and socioeconomic inequality clearly held in place by a dominant white power structure?  Could be.  Does what he say have value?  No doubt.  It is not 'Uncle Tom' to take a hard look at how racism and inequality become internalized by the oppressed, to examine how this internalization often manifests as irrational, sometimes self-destructive behavior and cultural trends.    It took guts for Cosby to take this stance and I'm glad Jesse Jackson is supporting him.
It's crap like  urlLink this  that gives hippies a bad name:   Rock musician David Crosby , founding member of the Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, pleaded guilty Friday to a gun charge, was fined $5,000 and sentenced to a conditional discharge.  The singer was arrested March 6 at the DoubleTree Suites Hotel in midtown Manhattan. Police said they found a Colt .45-caliber handgun, three clips of .45-caliber ammunition and two knives in his luggage.  Police also said the musician had a plastic bag containing an ounce of marijuana, a wooden container with a marijuana cigarette in it, a package of cigarette rolling papers and two other plastic containers with marijuana residue.   What a shame.  All the lovely music he's made and the mass movement of love and peace that he was a part of is overshadowed by the ridiculous behavior of an old drug addict.  Way to go, Dave.  More talking points for chronically uptight fascists in training.  There are no perfect humans that I know of.  For every David Crosby there's a  urlLink Jack Ryan.

By far the best headline I've seen in days:   urlLink  Late Cooking Diva Julia Child Loved Red Meat, Gin    Sounds straight out of a Grateful Dead song.  I bet Julia also played a mean game of poker.
I have a new favorite website. The British newspaper  The Guardian  calls their site  urlLink   Guardian Unlimited   , which contains content beyond what they print on paper. Noteable for their news coverage from outside the American corporate media machine, but just as appealing for their British take on all things cultural, it's a great place to browse for information and entertainment.  The inspiration for this post came from reading two articles online today.   urlLink  Barred painter's open air nude show     urlLink  Naked women, cars and sports help doubles sales of mens mags    The irony, when these two pieces are juxtaposed, is so thick and delicious you can cut it with a knife and relish in licking the bowl.  Yet, what came to me when I read the second article is a much more serious issue - men being manipulated, mostly by other men. It never ceases to amaze me how transparent it all is. Dare watching commercial television for even a short while and you will be flooded with promises aimed at men that they will have more sex and more fun if they buy certain products or participate in certain activities.  Guys, wake up! Don't you see what's going on here? You are not that stupid. You are not Pavlovian dogs! Shouldn't you feel insulted, used, stereotyped? Doesn't it bother you that it's mostly men who are selling these products, trying to exploit for their own personal gain you, their fellow men and the fact that you have been conditioned to reflexively respond to images of scantily clad women, flashy cars, rich sports celebrities, etc.? Do you think they should be raking in the dough, living a life of luxury, while you shell out your hard earned cash on items you might not purchase if you thoroughly thought about the options available.  As an example and proof that I am in no way preaching a puritan lifestyle, let's look at beer.  Question: Why in the world would anyone mindlessly choose Budweiser, Miller, or Coors when they can be enjoying  urlLink  Boundary Bay  ,  urlLink  Pike  , or  urlLink  Fish Tail  ?  Answer: Boundary Bay, Pike, and Fish Tail will not use sexual or other manipulative imagery to sell their products. Oh yeah...and they actually taste good too.   (While some would argue that another main reason for choosing Bud, Miller, and Coors is that they are cheaper, I would respond that men could easily afford the more expensive brews if they weren't blowing so much money on all the other stuff they've been manipulated into buying.)   So, my fellow male Homo sapiens, rise above your caveman roots and join me in a toast, over a pint of Boundary Bay's Imperial Oatmeal Stout: To the liberation of all men from the Sirens-in-drag of modern advertising!  Gulp. Ahhhhh! Damn, that's good!
Seriously, has it come to this?  Last night, on a whim, I looked up the NJ and NY phone numbers for the ACLU and put them in my phone.  This morning, they're doing bag searches again to get on the ferry. And the guy doing the searches pulls me aside and says, 'Sir, I feel that I need to confiscate  urlLink this book .'

On Sunday, I used the last of the beans in my apartment. On Monday, I made due with a cola. On Tuesday, I usually skip my coffee fix altogether, so I had forgotten to include beans in my day's errands. On Wednesday, today,  right now!  I am without coffee beans. Oh, the madness. Gives me a good excuse to walk the mile to the store before Seattle does yet another rendition of Miami with its too-hot-for-the-natives weather. Although, yes, I am not a native of Seattle, I do come from a 'colder' place, so I can play the trump card here, okay?! So, get off my back. I haven't had my coffee yet!  SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil has announced the creation of a coffee DNA data bank, which will help the country improve the quality and size of its coffee crop.  The announcement was made Tuesday by Agriculture Minister Roberto Rodrigues during a ceremony at Embrapa, country's agricultural research agency.  Over the past two years and at a cost of 6 million reals ($2 million), Embrapa and the Sao Paulo State Research Foundation worked on the Coffee Genome Project, which mapped 200,000 coffee DNA sequences, the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement posted on its Web site.   urlLink CNN  Well, thank gawd for that. Amongst the thirty beans or so that I use for my French press, there is always one or two beans that simply do not get with the program. Yay! No more hand sifting.  Oh, sure, I'll have to wait a few years and those coffee suppliers will still have to do a better job of keeping the medium roast beans far, far away from my dark roast, but I'll wait. But I need some -- rgxxxkckxsggrrrz -- coffee of the Mr. Hyde or Dr. Jekyll variety, I don't care,  right freaking now!
A special thanks to  urlLink  BuzzFlash   for helping me start my day with a good laugh.      urlLink  Bush campaign holds rally in Va.; Dems sense weakness     Bush criticized Kerry's plan to eliminate the tax cuts for those making more than $200,000 a year, saying that 'the rich in America happen to be the small business owners' who put people to work.   Bush also said high taxes on the rich are a failed strategy because ' the really rich people figure out how to dodge taxes anyway .'
Lombard's race is run  By Brendan Mooney  CATHAL LOMBARD has admitted to taking the performance enhancing drug Erythropoietin (EPO).  The 28-year-old Corkman will not contest the findings.  'I didn't set out to try and win medals or to make money. I just wanted to be as competitive as I could and have an equal chance with everyone else.   'I am not trying to justify what I did in any way; I am just saying this was the case, this is what I did and, hands up, I did it.'   Lombard, whose honesty is a historic first, expressed his sorrow and apologised to everyone in advance of the pending statement from the Athletics Association of Ireland.  'I got a letter faxed to me on Friday from the Irish Sports Council informing me of a possible breach of the Irish anti-doping rules,' he said.   urlLink Irish Examiner  - registration required, so see  urlLink New Zealand Herald   Ever since the line went beyond blurry to full-on, open use of professionals, the Olympics has been on a downward spiral. Now I do not care much if athletes use drugs or not, but if the rules forbid usage, then admit it. Come clean when caught. Of course, if judgment of rules abuse by the IOC is handled like the NCAA handles its issues, then many athletes are unfairly punished when taking something as simple as aspirin or cough medicine. Still, I gotta admire this Irish lad for his admission of guilt. Granted, he only deserves admiration because many, many athletes have long been denying their use of illegal substances.  Cathal, my next Guinness or Harp will be toasted your way. SlÃ¡inte!
When the rain comes  They run and hide their heads. They might as well be dead, When the rain comes, When the rain comes.

I can show you  That when it starts to rain, Everything's the same, I can show you, I can show you. Rain, I don't mind, Shine, the weather's fine. Can you hear me? That when it rains and shines, It's just a state of mind, Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
The key to moving towards  urlLink  energy independence   is to anticipate the knee-jerk reaction that the very powerful energy industry will have to any proposals that suggest a change to the status quo.  Listen, closely, you can almost hear them saying it now, 'This policy will put thousands and thousands of Americans out of work!'  No, actually, your pathetic, short-sighted management of your companies, not planning for the inevitable need to develop new energy resources to position your companies for success in the future, will put thousands and thousands out of work.    Ever have that argument with a free market capitalist who says that there is nothing wrong with 'big box' chain stores like The Home Depot coming to town and putting 'Mom & Pop' hardware stores out of business?  What's their biggest argument?  'If Mom & Pop can't get creative and figure out how to compete, then it's survival of the fittest.'    Any chance that this same free market capitalist would apply that same theory to, let's say, oil companies who claim that they will be put out of business by competing energy companies?    I didn't think so.  The truth is, regardless of how much environmentalists and anti-corporation activists despise the current energy industry, it makes no sense to propose policies that threaten these corporate giants.  If there is one thing that these companies are good at it's producing and distributing products to millions of consumers spread all over the globe.  Yes, production and distribution has been extremely destructive to the environment, but that is more a function of the toxic nature of the product than their business practices.    Kerry's plan, based on the scanty information available thus far, seems to understand the value of making the development of sustainable energy an attractive, money-making proposition for the energy industry.  Why reinvent the wheel when we can just make it a better wheel?  Will the energy companies still cry foul?  Yes, particularly because they are so financially and politically entangled in the Middle East.  However, given how badly it is going over there, while a U.S. President from an oil family presided over record-breaking gas prices, they may not have a leg to stand on.
So, I've finally come up for air. I'm taking too many breaths. I've got so much to do. So much to say. See in the last month -- off and on when not becoming a born again digital virgin (that's right, the technological kid has come in from the analog storm (storms are good every now and again)) -- I've been swimming through  urlLink content management systems ,  urlLink blogware  (again and sticking with  urlLink WordPress ) and  urlLink web standards .  Before posting a lot about which you may have no interest in reading (then please skim!), know that this is all gonna see the light of day (sorta) at t-floss when its appearance starts to shift.  urlLink Brand identity , baby! (If anybody knows the title of the book Tom Peters co-authored about branding, published circa 1980, please let me know. It was a fantastic book that doesn't contain all the awful self-help language he employs these days. The dark side of success. And branding. Everyone copies you and the parody makes the original laughable. Sorta. Anyway...)  There is a lot to web standards and  urlLink accessibility . No more do web developers have to write six different pages for six different browsers. Mainly, they need to focus on 5% of the web's users who use standards-compliant browsers and then do some minimal hacking to accommodate the other 95%. Cough, Redmond, cough. Please make IE7  urlLink the best browser . :pray:  Anyway, thank gawd that the browser wars are (mostly) over. (Now, could we do something about our two-party political process! I'm all about the lack of standards when the two opposing parties are basically the same. Um, where was I?) That's right, back in the halcyon days of early 2001 when I took to the road, I tried to redesign my website from my car while doing 85 mph. Zogging while others thought zagging was cooler than zigging. Well, I quickly learned that my poor HTML 3 skills were not going to cut it out on the open road. That Adobe GoLive could only do so much and too much (bloated code). Too many of my friends were having difficulty browsing my site or even downloading it (not to mention uploading it from a 14k wireless modem). Well, the downloading/uploading problem was easily solved but the browser issues were another matter. I threw my hands in the air and awaited the web world people to get their act together.  The saddest bit about all of this is that the tools to obtain web standards, CSS (loosely: design) and XHTML (loosely: structure)*, were finally accepted in prime time when I eschewed my web presence back in late-Spring of 2001. I've lost three years! Had I been patient or not been so taken by, um, well her name is unimportant...  *Content can be achieved by a variety of means as can XHTML but it is all circular and above the reach of this post.   So, if you are interested in standards, I suggest stopping by the sites  urlLink A List Apart  and  urlLink Asterisk* , the latter seems to be the most focused blog on web design issues regarding standards.  Of course, I am only now crawling out from the waters of theory (read: I was reading books) and onto the land of practice (read: plowing through websites for quick tips as I quickly relaunch my personal website), so there is probably  urlLink a lot more out there  concerned with my standards interests (both arguments for and against) that I've not had enough time to read. Oh, but here's one funny, funny piece,  urlLink Gurus v. Bloggers 2  ( urlLink part one ), for those interested in the contradictions of 'practice what you preach'. Both these Design by Fire (DxF) articles have plenty of great websites listed.
You know how it is.  It's 2 a.m. on a Saturday night.  Last call has come and gone.  Yes, there've been many identical nights like this one, out with friends sharing libations and that simple pleasure of camaraderie in our friendly neighborhood tavern.  Yet, to call these evenings ordinary was to overlook the priceless value they brought - the hours together, leaning on each other through the trials and tribulations of young adulthood, trying to make sense of all the pressures we felt from a world of parents and professors demanding a commitment to discipline, only sure about a few things - we liked each other, Rock & Roll music, cold beer in a cozy bar, and talking, as long as we could stay awake, about all our dreams.  Last call always came as a temporary let down until one of us casually said the inevitable, 'Who's hungry?'    There's a new film coming out called  urlLink   Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle   , described as a late night road movie, the adventures of two guys from New Jersey who get the munchies and are compelled to get to a  urlLink  White Castle   restaurant at all cost.  Being from New Jersey and having actually spent a few late nights in college making my way to and from White Castle, I couldn't hold off the rush of memories that came to me, though the more I read about the movie it is clear that, the similarities to my experiences notwithstanding, the film really has nothing to do with me and my friends.  Beyond the obvious, that the two protagonists are from Indian and Pakistani heritages respectively, while we were all white, middle class, mostly Jewish suburbanites, perhaps the clearest difference lies in the real reason for finding a late night eating establishment after closing down the bar.  It never was about the food.    A film that comes closer to what I remember would be Barry Levinson's  urlLink   Diner   .  A  urlLink  summary   of  Diner  from that website goes like this:  Set in 1959, Diner shows how five young men resist their adulthood and seek refuge in their beloved Diner. The mundane, childish, and titillating details of their lives are shared. But the golden moments pass, and the men shoulder their responsibilities, leaving the Diner behind.  In preparing this post, I emailed some of my old friends, asking them to share their memories of our precious late night gab sessions over food.  They'll hate this, but perhaps the years have caught up with them because their responses, more accurately a pathetic lack of responses, initially made me question my own rose-colored-glasses look backward.  One friend who still lives in New Jersey wrote that he remembers waking up in the morning feeling terrible from having eaten at a greasy spoon called  urlLink  The White Rose System  , popular for it's artery-hardening burgers and for being open 24 hours.  It's true that we always blamed the burgers for how awful we felt the next day, in total denial that alcohol might have had anything to do with it.    Still I hadn't gleaned what I hoped from the old gang, so I had to rely on my own recollections.  Fortunately, there are many fond moments and places to choose from - burger joints and pizza parlors after the bars, diners and Denny's after concerts in the city, dives from New Brunswick to Manhattan just shootin' the shit.  Perhaps the reason why I didn't get a better response from my friends has something to do with geographical distance.  Whereas we used to all live either together or within minutes of each other, we are now spread across the country, in New Jersey, Arizona, California, and Washington State.    Yeah, something tells me that if we were all together, sitting around a pizza pie and pitchers of beer, the stories would flood the place.  That's what it was always about.
A month ago I posted some  urlLink  commentary   on Bill Cosby's recent rants.  The Cos has been raising hell about how his fellow African-Americans, namely those living in poverty, are increasingly responsible for their lack of upward mobility.    As a follow-up, I highly recommend this excellent  urlLink  column   by none other than Henry Louis Gates, Jr. in the New York Times.  Gates draws on the Cosby comments as well as the now famous DNC speech of Barack Obama.  Here's a teaser:  Go into any inner-city neighborhood,' Barack Obama said in his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention, 'and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach kids to learn. They know that parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.' In a speech filled with rousing applause lines, it was a line that many black Democratic delegates found especially galvanizing. Not just because they agreed, but because it was a home truth they'd seldom heard a politician say out loud.   Why has it been so difficult for black leaders to say such things in public, without being pilloried for 'blaming the victim'? Why the huge flap over Bill Cosby's insistence that black teenagers do their homework, stay in school, master standard English and stop having babies? Any black person who frequents a barbershop or beauty parlor in the inner city knows that Mr. Cosby was only echoing sentiments widely shared in the black community.   (p.s. May this post serve as a not-so-subtle plug for the New York Times Online.  Yes it requires registration, but if there is any single publication worth going through the hassle of filling out and submitting a free registration form its this one.  If you don't like registering because you are worried about getting junk email, get a throwaway free Hotmail or Yahoo email account if you have to, but don't block yourself out of the Times for that reason alone.)
A recent dialogue with my 6.75-year old son:   son: Dad, my friend said that it's illegal to light fireworks on a day that's not the 4th of July on Vashon Island.  hjm: Well, your friend's just a little off there.  It is illegal here in Bellingham, but not everywhere.  I think your friend's just acting like he knows everything.  son: Yeah.  hjm: Don't you think it would be boring to know everything?  There would be no mystery to life.  son: Yeah, but it could be useful.  (pause, holding back a chuckle, followed by immense pride and adoration)  hjm: True.  Still, I think it would get boring.  son: Yeah, like for detectives.  They wouldn't have any mysteries to solve.

The other night i really felt like going on a walk and it was getting pretty dark outside so my mom said i couldnt stay out too long, i couldnt go too far, and i had to stay on the sidewalk...haha i know she's just protecting me and i woulda done all that newayz but i feel 8 years old...oh well. newayz.  right b4 i left the phone rang and it was brandon...he ended up coming over and we went on a walk together  bout halfway thru the nice walk/talk he ends up calling his ex gurlfriend (one of my best friends who has a 'thing' for my ex boyfriend who is bradons best friend) on his cell phone...nice move...okay i just wanna let everyone who knows about this little circle and anyone who is smart enuf to figure it out that i really dont care if she goes out w/ my ex i was just saying that i might not be able to handle it as well and i had alwayz thot that it was a rule not to date ur best friends ex b/f or g/f UNLESS you ask them first and get complete permission...and even then its really risky but OH WELL i dont like him anymore  nobody's in town its kinda annoying  what do you do if you like someone when ur online but ur not sure how much you like them when ur in person...not really looks or anything...what if they're just too quiet or their too 'energetic' or sumthing and you dont know how you'd deal w/ it but you really like their personality, say when ur online?  idk confusing  i need to go on more walks...its fun and i need some more sun and i need to work off the fat i'm developing from sitting around watching tv and eating..its crazy i'm craving everything! its freaking me out...me and brandon were making chocolate chip cookies (cuz once again i had a craving so we made some) and i started to have a craving for olives so i went to the fridge and had some olives...then i ate a half a spoon ful of butter cuz i was craving that..it smelled good. haha i'm weird  i work on friday! yay! not...if you wanna come visit me its from 4-7  Saturday i'm driving up to Illinois w/ my parents to go visit my sister and her family... i finally get to see my baby (my nephew actually) again! i miss him sooo much! havent seen them since Christmas so the sad part is he probly wont even remember who i am.  oh well he'll remember eventually! soo ya i guess i'll talk to you all later  i probly wont be on at all next week cuz i'll be on vacation again w/ my church! sooo excited!  well i'll see ya at school (i miss school! alot actually...just not the homework haha) mucho love xoxoxoxoxo  i dont like singing in german....at all!

(take back the whole order thing cuz this one i'm never livin down by my boyz) okay so me, sam and andrew are walking around wesslemans park...we had to go back to sams house and the two dorks ride their bikes there so one of them has to tote me or we're walking the whole way.  okay a) andrew cant ride a bike, specially w/ me sitting on the handle bars b) me...sit on sams bikes handle bars...HA my butt may be small..but not THAT small c) andrew couldnt ride sams bike for reasons that are not gonna be said...just think of the bike seat and how its positioned..ya  so we ruled that andrew could deal w/ his overly informed problems and they switched bikes and sam was gonna tote me to his house so i get up on the handle bars,  and sam starts peddling... he kinda swerves so i was gonna jump off RIIIIIIIIIIIIP supposidly my stupid pants got stuck on a screw and ripped my pants worse than you can even imagine! so ya sam wouldnt stop laughing as i fell to the ground as hes dying laughing he pulls off one of his shirts (calm down, calm down, he had anther one on darn the luck..haha no) and i had to tie his shirt around my waste for the LOOOONG walk home.... i'm currently sitting at my computer wearing a pair of his pants cuz ya when we got to his house he lent me some...ya get ur mind outta the gutter so ya  that was my interesting evening...other stuff like andrew throwing mountain dew all over this window at a gas station...which was absolutely STUPID and the ppl were like staring at us  and ya tori was getting really ticked today and got yelled at by this chick who was wanting tori to move the car but shes not a liscensed driver and her mom was in the mall and ya bunches of crap  so yes...typical day i guess...no   leave some comments and comfort me cuz today was the first time i...ripped my pants  mucho mucho mucho love xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo

i'm seriously considering changing my blog name and my url and stuff so if you have any suggestions just let me know.  i just put this one up for the time being.  if TJ reads this and you wanna help me get the tag board and all that peachy stuff up on this thing that would be just FABULOUS and while ur teaching me that stuff mayb you can give a few GOOD hints on ur stupid crush.  lol wow this has been fun.   dont you just love waking up to an empty house? seeing as i'm practically an only child, during the summer, this happens often. usually my mom wakes me up tho.  mayb she did but i coulda been talking in my sleep like i usually do.  lol tori 'I LOVE YOU ***** I LOVE YOU!' haha that was fun!    practically didnt have any chores this morning, thats probably the only reason i'm updating right now is cuz i have time.  all i had to do was empty the dishwasher, question...is it bad when you dont know where certain dishes go IN UR OWN HOUSE?! ya idk   sry if this blog is ever boring.  i guess i'm just not that funny.  wow...thats sad.   sooo ummmm been talking to monkey alot more lately which is alwayz good. still wish i could know what problems they have w/ me so i can fix them too.  i seem to be having a lot of problems w/ friends lately and have often wondered if mayb it was my fault.  i know they all are at LEAST half my fault but i was wondering if mayb they all were ALL my fault.  if you dont understand...dont worry bout it lol  i wasnt lucky enuf to have a 1 in the morning phone call last night...altho 'we' (former 1 in the morning phone caller) talked for about 45 min. last night but i had to get back online for some stuff and i think he had to go watch a movie w/ his family.  wow hes really blunt and absolutely hilarious.  now i just gotta think of a good name for him.  monkey knows who i'm talking about so if you can think of a good nick name...let me know...something like 'hair' would be good...lol!!!  well i dont like it when mutual friends of mine could possibly have a 'thing' it scares me mucho. it would be rather strange and i cant say that i DONT see nothing there cuz i do see a possibility.  so ya interesting stuff.  sry i cant give details.  well ummm guess i will be leaving you all now and TJ get back to me on that help unless you dont want to which would be perfectly fine.  i can alwayz jst invite 'linux' over when my parents arent home and he can 'help' me w/ some things.  OMG THAT IS SOOOO SICK. i dont even wanna think about that. so if you could help me it would be fabulous!  well everyone this is goodbye for now and i'll probably post tonight to let you know what happened today.  trying to make some plans w/ someone.  so ya and i have to go shower now. hehe cleaning is good.   mucho mucho mucho love xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo

haha weird title i know...but its mainly cuz my tooth hurts REALLY bad....argh lol  wow todays storm was CRAZY! we got stuck out in our car during it.  our car was like moving back and forth cuz of the wind...we ended up pulling over into a parking lot to be alittle safer i guess...but anywayz there was this poor old lady out in the middle of the street and she was like freakin out. she ran into quite a few things but she pulled over to where my dad could get in and talk to her to get her to calm down.  anwyayz we ended up driving her home and we hope shes okay now.  so prayers out to her!  yesterday was fun...i went over to my grandmas house to celebrate my mommy's birthday which is today and we had cake and stuff and lots of food.  then we went and picked up cody in my grandmas huge car.  when we pulled up his mom and his little sister jumped in next to me and was like...take us w/ you, you have enough room.  lol it was great! but anwyayz cody came w/ us downtown and we met up w/ cj and andrew after much searching.  we got caught in the rain but it wasnt bad...it was pretty funny.  we tried lookin for brandon in the dark but it didnt really work out and we ended up never finding him.    hmmm i cant really think of anything else thats been goin on.  haha this afternoon we got home after the storm and checked the answering machine for messages and my mom had one that had a woman a man and a little kid singing happy birthday to her but didnt say who it was.  we just assumed it was my uncle and his family. but i was talkin to cody later and it was his mom, brian, and his little sister kendall.  it was hilarious when we found out!  sick of waiting  cya later guyz leave a comment! luv ya xoxoxo
went to see dodgeball tonight and it was purty fun...the movie kinda sucked cuz it was full of too much crap but it had some funny parts i guess.  anywayz i had fun w/ the company tho so its all good  then we were gonna walk over to nicks pizza afterwords and hang out but ended up there almost being a fight and all this other crap between a couple guyz there and it was a mess.  they were all potty mouths too but by the time we got over to nicks it was like 30 min. till i was getting picked up so we didnt get to stay there very long lol it was kinda humorous tho.    Why does it take guyz so long to ask you out? idk wat they are waiting for.  oh well i need to wait anywayz to work somethings out w/ someone else b4 i can have anything happen honestly.  i really wish ppl would see eye to eye w/ me more often but i guess we cant all be that lucky so i honestly pray to God that this someone sees where i'm comin from and if not that i can just move on w/o any guilt.    ya so sam just got back from being outta town for like a week and he was gonna come to the movies cuz hes gonna be leaving tomorrow for another week but NOOOO he has been gone from the house for like 3 weeks and wanted to stay home and 'sit around' okay...w/e sam  i worked yesterday w/ michael and tyler for like 3 hours so it was purty fun....they talk alot lol bout random stuff too but i've discovered tonight that most guyz do.  tyler had me try vanilla mello yellow and michael made me try strawberry coke...they were both purty good but i liked the strawberry coke better.  see we have these different syrups that we put in some of our smoothies so when we're not that busy i go up and get a drink and squirt some syrup in it...its purty fun.    dont have too much to say right now...besides i cant stay on much longer but i'll try and write more later! luv ya all a bunch!  xoxo
school picnic was today...it was alright.  i have to say last years was better...mayb b/c of the new crush and the stalkerish attitude lol altho i do have to say i greatly enjoyed the speech excersizes we did. i specially enjoyed ripping up my cool card and playing ride the pony.  that was probably my favorite.   I had 3 things i could have done tonight...1. go to LOST at church...basically where they drop you off in the middle of no where with a group and you gotta find ur way back to the church but they leave you w/ a little poket money.  2. go to the drive in w/ cody and his d-group and the gurlz d-group that hangs out w/ them or 3. to go over to tjs house....wat does samantha end up doing???? staying home w/ her parents and going to subway wowness..i'm fun  i really dont have much to say ...sry most of the juicy stuff goes in my diary so i'm not lettin any of that out.   blah
i'm having weird feelings about everything but i'm not gonna talk about them....1. cuz no one probly cares lol 2. i just dont wanna 3. fact is, i really dont know wat to say about them       thanx TJ for the comments about my dad...that just totally rox and its awesome and ya you know it was cool lol      'No one can hurt me half as bad as i hurt myself' that quote basically shows my personality for the past month or two and present cept i dont listen to it and i continue hurting myself.  i'm so messed up right now.        life is so strange      or is it me?      probly the latter      any comments?
isnt it funny how you can love someone to death one day and then the very next loathe them enuf to want to never see them again!?!?! i really dont think it is.  but i can tell you it sux.        i hear from some i care too much...that i need to go w/ the flow and just let things role off my back...that i let things get to me too easily and i'm one of the few ppl who have such a caring attitude and that its a blessing and a curse at the same time (dont you hate those?) just like being hott....(hehe i love you kid)      but....   dun dun dun      some also say i dont care enuf...i let ppl slide w/ just a sorry which is just a word coming outta their mouths and its just dripping w/ disrespect and unimportance...the one you thot cared is really just manipulating you into their little slave cuz you've had them on a pedestal for as long as u've known them and its coming back and slapping you in the face...WHOA NOW i totally got way off...thats me venting w/o names      i was reading this stupid mythology thing and found myself acting very 'blondish' when it took me a chapter to realize why Echo was named Echo and why she was cursed w/ only the ability to repeat wat others say instead of having speech for herself.      but on the smart side of things...going back to my natural brunette color, i found the story about cupid and psyche very interesting how she let her sisters convince her that he was something he wasnt and she almost lost him forever....she went to great lengths to get him back of course but idk its weird how ppl influence you into thinking one thing when its something totally different.        ya know those ppl that came up w/ this stuff had a good idea on how to fix how things happened....i really think its all bogus but its kinda interesting some of the stories they think of....      omg i was totally thinking about how frikin scary would it be to suddenly like turn into a tree...wow       ANYWAYZ      i hate how guyz dont understand the meaning of gurlz time of the month...oh well they will jst never understand and i guess i'll just have to deal w/ that....   thank you for listening to one of sams boring blogs but plez leave a comment and let me know wat u think i should do or who u think i am or if you think i should just shut up...run away to the beach...and figure it out myself or if anyone agrees w/ me when i say i feel like i'm sounding like a certain someone...hmmm much homework for you all! hehe    luv you guyz
But I had some yummy Chinese food for dinner and now I am stuffed. Pete and I are going to watch Kill Bill -the first one. We havent seen it yet. fun fun. &nbsp; urlLink
Having to work on Saturdays is horrible esp. when its sunny. I mean it just shouldnt be allowed. Its nice to earn some money, but when its so sunny and all I wanna do is be outside working just isnt fun. I met a cool girl at work today though. She made work a bit more enjoyable. I have to work next Saturday too!! &nbsp; urlLink

So the other night there was this huge nasty spider on my kitchen ceiling. Since Pete was here, I asked him to kindly get it and put it outside or kill it. Well being the nicest mr. peacelover that he is, he said that he wasnt going to kill it. ok- i can understand that, but at least get it down, right? well because the damn thing was in a little corner -like most spiders are- he was hard to get down. I could not sleep knowing that this spider was possibly making babies and in the morning i would have to kill 12 not just 1 so I worked up enough nerve to kill the damn thing. Now, I feel bad because Pete is so sensitive when it comes to animals and insects. Animals are one thing, but insects- man i can smash an insect or spider in no time and not think twice about it--- or so i thought till now. So people tell me what you think. To kill the spider or not to kill the spider? One of my friends gave me a good recommendation and said get a glass jar and trap the spider in that and then slide a piece of paper up behind the back of the jar and the spider will fall in that and then you can throw him out. I think next time I will have to try that.
This week has been very exhausting at school. Its really hard sitting in lecture all day listening to these wonderful designers who are so famous and successful and not being able to do anything about it. I know that it all just takes time and commitment, but I am ready to start working and really learning hands on. This week is mainly business lectures- how to set up your own business, what kinds of accounting software to use, all the specification, licensing, trade information. One of the designers who set up her company after graduating from college went on to be very successful and was contacted by ppl in japan to go over there and design restaurants, watches, clothes, etc. She said that once you are a designer, the Japanese ask you to design many different things, not just interiors.... (sigh***) someday maybe.   Well, I am starting on gathering information for my first project. I think it will be so exciting, but at the same time kind of difficult. Its only a 3 star hotel and its main competition are all 5 star hotels. But this beach resort has much better beaches and a better location so I need to start sourcing asap. Tomorrow we will get the client brief and then I can start on my design analysis. We have a long weekend- Friday and Monday off- yeah!! I can catch up on sleep!! On Saturday after work, I am going to Sheffield to visit Pete's family. I'll meet his grandmother, who is going blind. I feel so sorry for her, she wants to meet me and see Pete one more time before she is completely blind. Also, Pete's dad's birthday is coming up. I have no clue what to get men for presents- esp. since I dont know him that well. I dont want to get him anything cheesy ya know? Any suggestions?  Oh, I signed up for some online courses (like I have time i know!) but they are free and I think I will be able to learn alot. I can take courses such as HTML, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, etc- it may be useful so that I can set up my own website someday.
I am trying to add this little tracking device/ hit button thing and its not working!!! :
We found out what our last and final project at KLC will be..... a beach resort in antigua!!! to check out the resort, go to www.hawksbill.com   Posted by  urlLink Hello
So I am finally trying to get together a portfolio to show prospective companies. After looking through all my projects, its really hard to put something in a portfolio when you think its crap... I wish I had more time to redo so many projects. But oh well, lets just hope that somebody out there somewhere wants to hire me---!!!! soon! hee hee  Posted by  urlLink Hello
Kill Bill was actually pretty good. I liked it but I can't stand sequels to movies. They are never as good as the first and I hate waiting months for the next one to come out. By the time they come out, I've forgotten half of the plot of the first one.    Posted by  urlLink Hello
urlLink    Silly picture of Mike and Missy&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Karen and I at the Mexican restaurant/ bar in Richmond being stupid smiling with limes in our mouths... &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Yes, Karen is wearing a hula skirt. We had a not so surprise Congratulations you got into law school party for her. The book we got her was called Yay, YOU!!!! &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    And here are her famous- Eggs to go. Breakfast in a hurry? Have some Eggs to go and you'll be on your way in no time! gotta love missy:)&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    While I was at home for Easter I went up to Richmond to visit Karen and Missy. I job shadowed Missy at work for a couple of days and this is a picture of Missy eating her breakfast from a paper cup. She doesn't do dishes. &nbsp; urlLink
I am completely stuffed!!! its one of those yum, im so stuffed and I just wanna sit back and watch a movie and not do anything kind of stuffed- not one of those- oh, i think i ate too much and am going to have a tummy ache one so thats good. pete and i went out to this indian restaurant we hadnt been to before and just pigged out. then we walked all the way to blockbuster and we were going to rent The Last Samuri- walked up to the counter and everything and.... i had forgotten my card and I also had Pete's card from the last time we went to BB, so we had to walk all the way back empty handed. How disappointing. So now I think Ill have to actually do some more work. Blah... Can you believe that I cant just give them my name and then rent the videos? They needed a pic id and i didnt bring my wallet out, so no luck there. oh well
I got my grades back from my last project and I did pretty well. Was quite 'chuffed' as everyone here says. My tutor said that my presentation was so strong and convincing that he thought i had come from a marketing background. NICE. anyway, just spent the last 3 hours working on my portfolio and it wasnt even a real portfolio, its just one done on powerpoint so that i can send it to prospective employers. I am quite happy with it, but i just need to change a few things. Oh and no it didnt take me 3 hours to set up the PP thing- I am fine with that, it was doing things on Adobe photoshop that took me so long. anyway, now back to my last project. I really cant wait for school to be through. to think that my evenings will actually be free- my own time -- sounds like paradise!!   oh- another good thing- it looks like ill be going to japan this summer!! yeah! im running out of my cosmetics anyway, and i only trust the japanese kind for my skin. so fun fun. lots of catching up with ppl and relatives. one of my friends is getting married!!!!
So Pete and I are just sitting here having a lovely dinner when all of a sudden we hear a huge CRACK and look up to see that our bay window in the living room has a gigantic hole in the window!! Some f*&#nut must have thrown a rock through our window. Who the hell would do that to us? We have no friends or enemies in Luton! Everyone we hang out with live in London. Let me just tell you one thing. LUTON SUX!!! it is the worst place! Ha- so at least you guys wont want to come and visit me. Anyway, had a nice weekend in Sheffield. But I somehow managed to pull a muscle in my back and it hurts like shit!! So I dont know what to do and all i want is sympathy. What do you do for a pulled muscle?? Never had one before...
well i just applied for two jobs today but im not holding my breath. one was for a company in London and another was for a company in Los Angelos. So what i really shouldve been doing was my work for my final project, but im thinking finding a job is a little more important. so pete informs me that our last day in this flat is july 13th! ok, thats only a little more than a month left. what are we going to do? hum... im supposed to have all this shit figured out by now, but of course things never happen like you plan so ive stopped planning. everyone says it will all fall into place, but i have yet to see that happen. i am waiting anxiously for my dream job to jump into my lap. i dont know whether to stay here in london with pete or go back to the states and get a job there. im so torn and have no clue. sometimes i just wish that someone would make up my mind for me--- because i change mine every second. for the time being, i guess just applying for jobs in london and the states will be good. but i just dont know. why give up a good thing when nothings wrong ya know? hmmm... lots to think about, but after doing some thinking over the past 9 months i havent come up with an answer so how will one more month give me the answer? yeah right.  well, its midnight. i have to get up tomorrow at 7 and commute 2 hours to school and work on my last project. fun fun.
I just started checking out airline prices for a flight home and they start around $1200!! That is just insane! I was able to fly from London to Charlotte roundtrip for about $600 around Christmas and thats the busiest time of the year! How could the price jump up to 1200?? OMG... what am i going to do?? hmmm...
Wow. it is gorgeous outside! Absolutely beautiful!... and i have to be inside drawing all day!! How annoying! I cannot wait for this project to be over. I have never done anything that consumes my life 24 hrs a day. I have already had so many dreams about this project- the presentation, the design. Isnt that crazy?  Oh, on the good side of things, I got an email from an interior design company in California who is interested in seeing my portfolio! Yeah! I would love to move to Cali- good weather, good food, and right by the ocean. Perfect! Keep your fingers crossed. I sent her my portfolio yesterday.
well, i turned in my last project today. yeah!! its all over! tomorrow, i am first up for presentations so at least ill get it over with quickly. but man am i tired!! i got an email back from the interior design company out in LA and she liked my portfolio!! yay! but i think she is looking to hire someone immediately and because i will not be back in the states till mid july, i dont know...  but yes, i finally bought my tix home- for july 10th! so i will finally after 3 years be stateside again. im getting all excited just thinking about it!
Well, for those of you unacquainted with my travels over the past year, I'm current in grad school at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  It's not quite LA Tech, but I make do.  I've been working on some pretty esoteric problems in power systems, so I'm pretty sure any more details about what I'm doing would be cause for some type of beating.  Lately I haven't been able to engage in anything of any real excitement here(unless eating funnel cake while listening to a demolition derby counts) due to a pretty strict regimen of work and little sleep, but I'm certainly up for reading about someone else having the fun I'm missing.  There's also an open invitation to come up and watch me study for my qualifying exam in November.  Yes, that goes for all of you.
I can only assume that everyone's elses silence is out of awe at the power of my first post. Please don't let that stop you. People will want to read your posts even if they aren't as amazing as mine -- our readers are realistic.
I much prefer that opening to Lucas's 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,' but I have to admit that one of my favorite parts of a very funny speech a friend of mine used to give revolves around the fact that, although  Star Wars  is futuristic, it's supposed to have happened in the past. Remind me and I'll tell you the joke sometime. Or if you have ten minutes, do yourself a favor and  urlLink watch the speech .
Trying to get a list together and hopefully get at least some mild timeframes for Matt's last party as a free man (excepting of course the night before his fune..err, wedding).  Last conversations put the approximate date of the gathering near March 12th or March 19th. The two major venues I heard mention are Las Vegas and New Orleans. I'm mostly inclined to go with a majority view, but please be aware that not everyone who 'gets a voice' has access to this forum.  My personal vote - for both financial and lazy reasons - is New Orleans. With a good crowd, it's hard to beat the French Quarter and Uptown for drinks and tomfoolery.  Assuming we could get people to land in New Orleans at close to the same times (or a couple of times), I'm not opposed to providing transportation for the weekend.   I know golf courses and paintball facilities within 45 minutes of New Orleans.  Live music is everywhere.  I'm sure I can speak with a few friends to find the right gentleman's establishments for poor little engaged Matt.  Anyway, Vegas is also an option, I just have to do more research for it.   Thoughts, suggestions, gibberish...
James Lileks has his problems, especially as a blogger, but he deserves a special place in the web hall of fame for his  urlLink Gallery of Regrettable Foods . Do yourself a favor and check out  urlLink Meat! Meat! Meat!    Warning:  Probably better if you aren't wolfing down a meatloaf sandwich while viewing this. And don't do it at work unless you coworkers are accustomed to unexplained giggling interspersed with the occasional guffaw.
I've just been reading Toqueville's  urlLink Democracy in America  (for those of you with portable devices, try  urlLink here ), and I must say it's an amazingly relevant book given its age, though maybe I'm just overwhelmed by my first real poli. sci. book.  Though I'm not sure if the book even qualifies as poli. sci.  I'll publish some quotes later when I have the book in front of me.  I can't believe I went through my entire  urlLink high school  and  urlLink undergraduate  career without even hearing mention of it.
Check out the latest Department of Energy budget  urlLink here .  The amusing part comes from the amount spent on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (or 'The FERC', which sounds more appropriately ominous).  Any guesses as to how much money the DOE gives to FERC?  The answer: 0.  That's right.  DOE gives roughly $8 billion dollars to weapons research, and zip to the guys who have (arguably) the most influence on how much power costs in your home, and how to prevent things like blackouts.  This is why FERC can only hire starting engineers at  urlLink $38000 , whereas the national average starting salary for electrical engineers is around  urlLink $50000  (it's the 3rd most lucrative degree available).   It's pretty sad that such a potentially meaningful job has such poor salaries...and might explain some of the ill-thought-out work ( urlLink SMD , anyone?) they produce.

urlLink Evolutionism Propaganda  You heard it here first--the concept of evolution is responsible for the spread of AIDS:  'They argued that AIDS is constantly evolving and if it weren't for Darwin we wouldn't understand why and thus would be helpless in treating the disease  (they conveniently neglect to point out that Darwinistic propaganda equating us with animals might have helped to spread the disease in the first place) .

Hello, Iâm back againâ¦â¦â¦. Friday was simply great; I did wear a saree after all. Since I live close to work (about a 5 min drive) my friends made me go home and change into a saree. Luckily my mum was at home so she draped the saree for me. The weekend was pretty busy. I met up with a few of my old office friends on Sunday after nearly 2 years. It was a huge effort on Ashâs part to get all of us together, but she did it nevertheless. It was really nice catching up on what has been going on and most surprising was, after we spoke for sometime, we realized most of our colleagues in office are either married or have a baby!!!!! We all met up at Barista and sat there for about 2 hours just catching up on what we had missed. Jerry is now a manager doing Strategic Planning (playing Sin) :o), Dhanya and Ash are trainers, Bryan is a Quality Analyst, Anne is back in college and Sujit and Conrad are doing very well for themselves. Gayathri who apparently didnât turn up on Sunday, is now in charge of training. Three years back, all of us just out of college, looking for some place to start our careers. We got to know each other better and sooner than we realized we were good friends. All of us were in one team fortunately J and we continued to work together. Being our first job, every one was very enthusiastic, especially Ash, she would come to work even on her days off; our manager had to literally drive her back home. It was these friends who like a dose of caffeine, kept me awake during night shifts (2:30 am â 11:30 am).They were one of the reasons I looked forward to going to work (and the salary also :0) We used to go sometimes to a resort on team outingâs and we used to have a ball. Getting back to work next morning was a problem, but thatâs beside the point. Little by little, people started leaving; Sujit was the first one and then Anne, then Connie and Brian and then me. Ash, Gayathri, Dhanya and Jerry still work in the same place. As months and years went by, we lost touch; everyone was so busy doing their own thing but the evening out on Sunday was an ice-breaker. It was like re-living the good times we had, how this first job has molded our future, our personality and not forgetting the precious friends we made. There is nothing better than the pleasant memories you carry with you as you move ahead in life.
12th August After a long thought about what to post in my second blog, I am still clueless and my imagination seems to abscond when I need it the most. Well here I go anywayâ¦â¦.just another day at work, that too not too much of it. Itâs not very nice when you finish your work at the beginning of that day and then you have about 3-4 hours left with nothing to do. I wish I could go home instead L 13th August I am back again, this is the second day and itâs taken me around 24 hours to write a few lines. Since the  Indian Independence Day  falls on a Sunday (waste of a good public holiday) we are having Independence Day celebrations in office today. To celebrate the spirit of Independence we decided to dress in Indian Traditional clothes. I conveniently forgot about it and realized this just before I could leave from home this morning and it was too late to decide to wear a saree. The Saree is the Indian Traditional Dress worn by the women. It is usually 5-6 yards longs and is draped around the waist in a very beautiful and elegant way which I donât think I will ever be able to master. It takes me hours to wear the saree and even after that it looks like Iâve just wrapped a bed sheet around myselfL. A Saree comes in different fabrics, Chiffon, Georgette, Silk and Cotton, to name a few. There is a particular type of saree with a lot of gold thread woven in the fabric, this is called âZariâ and it is the most beautiful Indian Dress I have ever seen. Everything is so colorful here, weâve got the Indian flags all over the office and everyone looks so bright and beautiful in Indian Clothes. Iâm off to celebrate our Independenceâ¦â¦..bye

I'm 13 years old now, and one person said, 'You are a teenager right now, and it is going to be a hard moment in ur life.'  First time I don't really expecting that moment coz I know it's going to hard, but, right now, I feel it.. I'm going to be a teenager, and I'm starting to feel the difference from childhood into teenagerhood. Like she said, it's going to hard. I know, it's just the beggining, and  it's hard enough for me.   My mum is a great woman, she passed a very terrible childhood with her mother, and she is a very great mother for me right now. That's why I adore her so much. I have 3 sisters, mm, 3 older sister actually, and I'm the last. I'm the fourth.   Every one says that teenager is hard for everyone and for the child's mother coz she must help and face her child's bad behave. My mom, ... 3 times already.. And it's going to four. Me, the last one, I don't wanna be the worse of course.. It's hard for me, and it's going to a very long long hard way for me to pass. I try to behave as nice as possible, and again, it's hard. Well, there's none easy live, right?   Like all of teenager stuff, I'm thinking about boys and girls connection.. I know for sure that it's not my time to have a boyfriend, ofcourse!But,sometimes I wonder, why some of my friends making 'love' each other so sooN. What is it for? It's no use, I think. But sometimes I think the opposite, why do parents forbid their children to attach each other? it's for their experience, right? As long it doesn't disturb their school.. Why why and why?? Oh God, I'm a teenager, and it's hard.   And, sorry if my English is weird enough to make u lil bit confused.
Huaaa!!! I spent this day with study study and study,coz like usually, I'll have my exams tomorrow! And you know what, I've got a terrible thing today. My teacher told me tat I got about 7 or somthin in my english exam 2 days ago... Oh God! Terrible! Horrible! My God! I don't know tat I can become that careless human being! Specially in English! Hhh... At least I can still cheer today at school coz I can do my all of my examz today well. Ha.. Good newz... my friend is going to celebrate her birthday in TA and she'll pay for it.. Haha.. So tat I'm not goin to waste my money but I can eat delicious foods... Hahaha... By the way, I really2 wanna watch 'The Day After Tomorrow', good movie, huh?? Haha, but, yeah..

Hi everyone! I'm new in here... Just wanna say Helloo!!!
Much funny.  2 points.  As mentioned in the email, no game this week; I have to research a 13th century poem for a final paper.  I enjoy the work, but I'd much rather have swashbuckling adventure in wintery Hillsfar.
Harpers, Harpers, everywhere.  Harpers, Harpers, they really care. Harpers, Harpers, stay in motion.  Harpers, Harpers, healing potions. Harpers, Harpers, pins of green.  Harpers, Harpers, enter the scene. Harpers, Harpers, formed by a bard.  Harpers, Harpers, .... What?  A Bard?!?!  You got to be fucking kidding me, right?!?!  A Bard?!  Jesus Christ, we're screwed!!
In an earlier post, Johnathan said:   'And then: What of Gregory? Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein? ........ There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits. But what Glory will that be? The Local Hero? The Regional Hero? The Hero of the Land? The Hero of a World? Or the Hero of the Multiverse?'   To respond to this in a way, I would say that Gregory is really having to make a sort of leap of faith to swallow all of this extraplanar stuff.  He gets it and doesn't get it at the same time.  He can understand the world as being a large and changing place, but seeing Father Castillion in the Ethereal plane...well, freaked him out.  To Gregory, it was basically like talking to a ghost, and that is just creepy.  He understands gods, but for there to be something bigger than gods that can take a whole planet and put it in the middle of a nothingness place, it's just a bit much.  Even though he is actually experiencing it, he is still kind of thinking in the back of his mind, 'Yeah....right....whatever you say man.'  And what glory will he find?  Local Hero?  Multiverse?  He would most likely never expect to rise above something between Hero of the Land and Hero of the World.  Frankly, because he doesn't really see/understand the whole multiverse thing, and even being 'Hero of the World' is kind of pretentious in his eyes.
I'd post this on the RTG Blog, but I can't post there. Could someone either post or e-mail me the resolution to the Catillian situation? As the original hook of our adventure, I'm kind of curious. Thanks.  # posted by IDIC : 10/23/2003 12:53:31 PM     Castillion  was rescued during the collapse by unnamed friends, and is now alive and well in the Ethereal. The party talked with him in the office of Din Dal Kut, who resides on a splinter plane. It seems that when Thulos took Terranel, the 'local group' of the multiverse was torn away with it, and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the in-between-place.   A side result of this occurence is that, according to Castillion, the dead have nowhere to go, and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia. Castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods, if possible. He has recommened that the party join forces with the Harpers, a secret society formed by the last Elven bard at the very end of the Great Retreat.   Upon seeing Calleum and the banner of Heironeous in a magical viewing painting/frame on Din Dal Kut's office wall, Burne leapt to join his mentor, and was last seen in a battle in Rashemen, one of the lands that borders the Far East. The act broke the portal, and the party was unable to follow.   Also, Castillon is Ian's father.   Having reached the end of the original journey, Ian and Gregory are beginning to question if they should continue, or return to Tilverton to tell of Castillion's demise -- which was Castillion's request, as the truth would be too difficult to understand.  Players have the option of sending their character off to do something long-term, and create and play a new character. The world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such. Once the false murder rap is resolved, the party may see the Breaking of the original Fellowship -- but the beginning of a much larger, world-spanning epic.   # posted by Harmony : 10/23/2003 02:00:31 PM
The answer to the first question lies with Master Po; the answer to the second is Sister Jayna, the priestess who took over after Castillion departed.
it seems odd to think of brother ian as having a father.  he seems like the type that just sprouted out of the ground. and if fc really is his father, then why didn't he claim him earlier?  who is his mother?
since our next game is the weekend of halloween, why don't we all dress up like our characters next session?
- Hillsfar, ruled by Lord Malthiir, believed by the party to be a former gang/crime lord, who came to power by unknown means.  - The Red Plumes, an army of mercenaries recently added to a pre-existing smaller force; news its victory over the most recent orc attack (of which there have been three so far in the region) is spreading, attracting more enlistees.  - The local Thieves' Guild, a member of which helped acquire the antidote for Ian and Rhanellus  - The Hand, a mysterious order of deadly monks and assassins  - K'Sh'Aal, a powerful unidentified figure who apparently pulls many strings; according to Luc, the name is reminiscent of those used by dragons - The Zhentarim, an order of sorcerers who actively seek power; rumor suggests that they are on the verge of an internal struggle  - The Harpers, a centuries-old secret society that seeks a way to restore Faerun  - Jalal, the Elven-designated watcher/keeper of Cormanthor  - Garovia, a recently-awakened corrupted Druid, whereabouts unknown  - Orcs, thousands of which live north of the Moonsea; the attack on Hillsfar is the third such action in the past year  - The Citadel of the Raven, a tower complex where resides Lividia, who has been linked to Rhanellus, the sacking of Shadowdale, keech (an addictive plant), the recent orc invasion, possible agents within the Red Plumes, and the foreign goblin machinists  - Lizard Folk, of which nothing is known except they attacked the party during the interrogation of a keech-addicted Red Plume guard   Plus various individual contacts the party has met or heard of.
It's okay, rock lobster.  All is well.  If email is iffy, we can always use this handy blog.  I will make an effort to deliver announcements both here and by email.
perhaps we can have it that if an email is sent out that a confirmation email can be sent back.  i don't know why it didn't go through or why no one received it.  the only way ben knew what he did is because i spoke to him on thursday.   i'm going to stop using the netscape account though - if everyone could change my email to madduxmir@yahoo.com, i would appreciate it. sorry again
Mir -- Ben said something about 50/50.  Regardless, we missed you; hope your day was a good one.  Father Castillion has been found, and the end of the battle of Hillsfar was remembered, in which everyone earned an average of 2,000 xp, and a few leveled.  Also, Scott got some much needed rest.
I don't know how long RTG will last. I don't see a reason to end it, as I am presently committed to gaming as a regular activity in my life. Players may come and go, but I will be writing and running some sort of game as long as people want to participate in such.  # posted by Harmony : 10/15/2003 03:31:00 PM   so does that mean rtg will last until 2005?  # posted by hotcocoa : 10/15/2003 02:56:13 PM   At my current pace, I will graduate in either Dec '05 or May '06. Sure takes a long time to earn 48 credits.  # posted by Harmony : 10/15/2003 11:46:41 AM
and as far as characters go, i like luc - i want to see where her story goes - i've committed over 2 years to seeing how she would develop and i want to see the ending.  i feel like i owe it to her.
and i don't even believe that duellacathata is actually dead.  i can't believe that powerful of a magic user wouldn't have a backup plan in case her body was destroyed.
To be fair, Duellacathata didn't directly frame the party; that was (supposedly) the desire of K'Sh'Aal (or, rather, his/her/its representative).  Duellacathata just wanted Falchez dead and buried in his family's magically sealed tomb.  Or so she claimed.  Ashes, of course, tell no tales.
i'm going to stick with Ian, for now.  but having the choice is quite cool.   welcome, scott!  glad you were able to get in this time.  let me know if you have any further trouble.  any chance we could just teleport to the dragon's graveyard, and then teleport back?  'cause *damn* it's a long way back south, in the opposite direction of everything else we want to see, even by way of the cave network previously mentioned...  after we find out about castillian, i say we:  - clear our names, expose the conspiracy, report the lizard men sighting - determine burne's fate - go destroy the keech fields and, maybe, lividia - find a big enough city where we can all train and otherwise increase our skills  not necessarily in that order, but close enough.  was the Hand mentioned as possibly being involved in our current predicament, in regards to the murder we've been accused of?  can't *believe* that Zhenterem bitch killed that banker and framed us for the murder,  just so she could raise him from the dead to steal from his own deceased grandmother.  way to go, rhanellus!  burn baby burn...
Once the party discovers what happened to Castillion (a mystery that technically matters directly to only two present characters -- Gregory and Ian), the group will be at an interesting crux:  What Next?  The party is now international in membership, and global (and beyond) in awareness of The World.  The mysteries and challenges that have been placed on the table are definitely different from how the story began.  This may be frustrating to some, and I understand the desire for simplicity (Let's Just Get The Ring to Mount Doom), but it was always my intention to create a broad, organic world within which various characters could pursue adventure and glory.  I had done the Single Through-Line campaign before; I was interested in trying something with fewer (if any) boundaries.  The catch, though, is that the game began with certain set archetypes, if you will -- various Local Yokels and a couple of Wild Cards who set out to figure something out -- and those archetypes may, very reasonably, strain a bit at the edges as they move beyond the comfort zone of what they originally intended and expected to do.  Which is kind of my point -- what do the players feel about their characters' comfort zones?  Of the current party, Fennie and Connor are the most likely to pursue adventure for its own sake.  Rhanellus has a personal journey to take that seems, at the moment, to be connected to the Big Picture in some unknown way.  Adan has a spiritual calling to Right What Has Been Changed, and it is natural for him to roam the world on that quest.  Luc, like Rhanellus, has a personal journey that seems linked somehow to the events of the world -- specifically, the often-mentioned return of the Demon Kings.  But then, there are other issues:  Connor would probably like to find the other two thirds of the Codex one day; Fennie would like to put this map to the Dragon's Graveyard to use before she dies; Luc would like to know who made her a 'key,' and can it be undone; and Rhanellus wants to go wherever clues lead him to his own self-knowledge.  Each of these goals is, unlike the World In Crisis situation, not only individual and unique, but geographically diverse -- to the point:  Candlekeep, the Citadel of the Raven, the mountains on the other side of the Dalelands, Cormyr, Zhentil Keep, and the distant land of Thay.  Talk about an Indiana Jones red line map crawl.  And then:  What of Gregory?  Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein?  Likewise, what of Ian?  Should he return to the monastery and report what he has learned, or is he a free agent?  I'm not declaring anything here -- just sharing some observations from this side of the screen.  What we have now is the result of something I have personally always wanted to do, but never tried -- a game world that spans centuries, nations, and even continents and oceans.  There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits.  But what Glory will that be?  The Local Hero?  The Regional Hero?  The Hero of the Land?  The Hero of a World?  Or the Hero of the Multiverse?  Certainly questions worth thinking about.  As I mentioned in the previous post, all characters are welcome to follow their path to Glory from the point where they started.  Likewise, players are free to create new heroes should their characters evolve onto a path unique to themselves.  Unless a character dies, everyone who has been in the world will still be an active and prominent participant in the world, even if they are not represented in a game session.  Boris Borovich and Burne Trinson are out there even now, making choices that matter.  The same could be said of any character that chose to veer off on his or her own.  Personally, I like all the characters.  I enjoy their choices and their actions, both their desires and the things they don't really give a flying fig about.  All are welcome to do as they please, as they follow their own Road to Glory.
Referring to Johnathan's post, I think that the party clearly does not have the same goals.  This is fine, mind you, but needs pointing out none the less.  Personally, I just don't feel that Gregory has evolved enough within himself to be able to broaden the lens/scope for him.  He is still very much following his own set of goals.  Some of which are shared by other party members, such as finding Castillion, but like the majority of the party, he seems to have his own agenda.
[ Mon Oct 06, 05:44:17 PM | hot chocolate ]  oh burne, how i miss thee and thine control over ye big mouthed monk.   [ Mon Oct 06, 04:19:35 PM | Harmony Baggins ]  ...and so it was that Burne lived out his years, with wife and kids, in the land of Chesterfieldius.   In case you're curious: after pursuing various leads regarding both their recent memory loss and the murder they are suspected of committing, the party has made a curious and partially unexplained bargain with several Illithids, who promise to restore their memories -- an act which may resolve several questions, one of which being the location and activities of the missing Burne.   [ Mon Oct 06, 03:22:03 PM | John Robinson ]  RTG Notebook My famous/infamous notebook is currently enroute to Mr. Haley via a courier who will exchange for some SG-1 DVDs when he next attends a non-cancelled Hand of Shiva session. Good journey.
To paraphrase JMS of B5 fame, one might consider this the story of a platoon in WWII.  Whatever happens to the platoon, the story of WWII goes on, often dwarfing the individual soldier.  Perhaps the best one can hope for is to be present at Midway, or help raise the flag on Iwo Jima, or be the bombadier on the Enola Gay.  Regardless, there are two valid choices:  either to focus only on one's own mission and interests, or to expand that focus to include the scope and detail of the war in part or in its entirety.  What the player finds entertaining, rewarding, and manageable is often defined by what he or she chooses to be specifically relevant to the character.  Of course, in a party of seven characters, there are seven separate lists of what is relevant.  If one is to remain with a party and not go off on one's own -- which would be perfectly acceptable, except that it would result in leaving the game -- there is an argument to be made for being aware of what the other six individuals deem relevant to them.  Otherwise, one is watching choices without clear motivation, and the result can be a frustrating chaos.  Thus, the list of what one needs to know to function within the story grows a little bit longer.  And so on.  By the way, as a general note:  If any player starts to feel that his or her character *would*, at some point, decide that it's more logical to leave the party and pursue his or her own agenda, it is perfectly acceptable for the player to create another character that will join the party and take the previous character's place.  There's no rule that says you must stay with one character throughout.  Once provided with the player's basic guidelines/requests, I would NPC the character Somewhere Out In The World until such a time that the player wanted that character to return.  Alternately, the path of the absent character might later intersect with the party again, and for a time the player could play both until one left again (hopefully this would only be a session or two.)  Anway -- just a random thing to toss out there.  Even though it began as a simple mystery of What Happened to Father Castillion, the camera has pulled back far enough now that almost all the world is in play.  Thus my interest in launching some side games that occur elsewhere in the world's history.  This post, like many stories, seems to have grown with the telling.  I'll stop now.
dude, i have no idea where that notebook is now but i get your point.  i can keep most of it in my head, it's just such an epic  and i have such a hard time pronouncing the names!
[ Mon Oct 06, 12:11:48 PM | hot chocolate ]  and the cast still remaining from the first season are:  Scott Moran (Gregory)  Miriam Maddux (Luc)  Ben Haley (Brother Ian)  Jimi Harrell (Rhanellus)   the scoobys   and of course, the god of us all, Johnathan Shipley.   [ Mon Oct 06, 11:28:50 AM | Harmony Baggins ]  Early 2001. A little over two years, I think.   [ Mon Oct 06, 10:00:10 AM | hot chocolate ]  how many years have we've been playing now?    [ Mon Oct 06, 09:11:03 AM | Harmony Baggins  ]  Thanks, chocolate. Though a game isn't any good without players to make it so.   [ Sun Oct 05, 07:46:58 PM | hot chocolate ] great game johnathan!
Perhaps you can make notes to yourself during the game, as John did.  I supplied notebooks and folders to everyone at the beginning of the campaign for that purpose.
very interesting but hard to keep in head all at once.
Small Picture   - murder rap - lack of identification papers / peace-bonded weapons - K'Sh'Aal - lost 11 days - where's Burne - good/bad Red Plumes - Plume patrol emitting magic aura during battle - Red Plumes defeat orc army twice their size; word spreading beyond Hillsfar - Plume soldier addicted to keech; possible source = Lividia?; link with Boragard and the Bullyboys? - K'Sh'Aal = 'K'? - Esseneth, Luc, and a book you can't put down - Lizard Men under the city - memory flashes of possible forgotten places/events - curious tracks in rooms = possible lead in abandoned area of Civic District - Ethelred, during battle, notes that Rhanellus has two souls...? - Connor's contacts in Hillsfar = info? - How did the party acquire the antidote? - Who wounded Rhanellus and Ian?    Big Picture   - Zhentarim; Zhentil Keep; possible civil war? - Cormyr vs. Sembia:  Spring = War? - Dragon's Graveyard: worth going to right now? - Thulos - Yoggoth - Harpers - Strife between Drow Houses in the Underdark - Arabel (default capital of Cormyr), Lady Myrmeen, the Order of the Shining Dawn, Tilverton threat? - Castillion's fate: still relevant? - Threat from the East? - Demons/Demon Kings rising or returning? - Giants gathering north of the Citadel of the Raven? - Zhentarim interests:  black powder, dead giants, crystal swords, time control, demonic sites - Fate of the Obliat - The Shadow of Semerius / Dragons - Fairies and Dragons = the first beings on Teranel? - Curious historical discoveries - Connor's Codex is one volume of three - Mystra's Tear, magic's wane - Where did the Elves go, and will they return? - The Hand and Master Po - What is Calleum doing in the Great Dale? - What army will Gregory lead; did the girl in Shadowdale truly have a gift? - Rhanellus attaked his son...? - Luc is a gift and a key = Shaddath? - What was going on at Adbar / Hellgate Keep? - Can Teranel be restored to whence it was taken?  Just some things to ponder.
greetings, RPG'ers.  these two new blogs for 'glory' and 'shiva' have been designed for discussion about the respective games.  this will provide a place for us to discuss our characters, the current plot threads, and perhaps even come up with some answers to the puzzles that have been presented to us.  it may also serve as a way for the respective Game Masters to get a feel of where the group is heading.  my original and grander plans for 'ahvanet' may be on hold indefinitely; rather than wait until the whole thing comes together, i decided to go ahead with the blogging portion.  please keep the random tomfoolery to a minimum, so that we can maintain focus; we've got 'circle of irony' for that!
god hates his day job
Testing...1.....2....3......tap,tap,tap. Hey! is this thing on? Hello....
yo, yo, yo homeslices!
Hey folks -- check your email!  No game today.  Apologies to all, explanations within.
i will be there for the entire game this week.  woo hoo
Even funnier if you replace the guys with a drow, a beholder, and an illithid.
joke moved to circle of irony  err...actually not.  forget it ever existed  These are not the droids you're looking for.
i will be at the next game!
The road to glory is currently a quiet one, it seems.  Welcome, Rahn'Keth.  I'm your private dancer.
Hey!  You buckle your swashes someplace else, pal!  This is a family friendly joint!
man, that was like one of the best games ever....
this is what i also look for in relationships:  No More Messy 'Inky' Towels and Hands  *   Easy Break Down and Assembly  *   Customizing Evolving Map  *   Standard One Inch (1') Grids

RTG Party 1.0   (*) indicates Blood of Tilvernus  - Burne Trinson*, Paladin of Heironeous, of Tilverton - Brother Ian, Monk, of Tilverton - Boris Borovich*, Fighter, of Tilverton - Gregory Sendant*, Ranger/Fighter, of Tilverton - Luc, Bard, of Cormyr - Rhanellus, Sorcerer/Fighter, heritage unknown   RTG Party 2.0    changes:  Boris Borovich returns to Tilverton; Connor joins in Shadowdale  - Burne Trinson, Paladin of Heironeous - Brother Ian, Monk - Gregory Sendant, Ranger/Fighter - Luc, Bard - Rhanellus, Sorcerer/Fighter - Connor McClaren, Rogue/Wizard, of Hillsfar   RTG Party 3.0    changes: Fennie joins in the Underdark  - Burne Trinson, Paladin - Brother Ian, Monk - Gregory Sendant, Ranger/Fighter - Luc, Bard - Rhanellus, Sorcerer/Fighter - Connor McLaren, Rogue/Wizard - Hermione Fenwick, Rogue, of Sembia   RTG Party 4.0    changes:  Burne departs for Rashemen; Gregory acquires new talents; Adan joins in Hillsfar  - Brother Ian, Monk - Gregory Sendant, Ranger/Fighter/Druid - Luc, Bard - Rhanellus, Sorcerer/Fighter - Connor McLaren, Rogue/Wizard - Hermione Fenwick, Rogue - Adan, Cleric of Fharlangn, of the Great Dale   RTG Party 5.0    changes:  Brother Ian and Gregory choose to deliver news to Tilverton; three as-yet unknown heroes join  - Luc, Bard - Rhanellus, Sorcerer/Fighter - Connor McLaren, Rogue/Wizard - Hermione Fenwick, Rogue - Adan, Cleric of Fharlangn - Unknown #1 - Unknown #2 - Unknown #3  Party 5.0 will represent 8 different geographic regions of Faerun -- none of them Tilverton.  Also, the Blood of Tilvernus is no longer present.  Only two witnesses remain of the Winter's Edge festival that initiated the long road to glory.  Including the three new additions, the campaign has produced 12 unique player characters so far.  What new, future souls may join the present struggle remains to be seen.
...but the spirit of the fellowship remains, so long as we hold true to the purpose of the one we sought and found.  Castillion's path is much like our own; he left his home with small but noble intent, but now walks a much longer road, towards a goal of global (cosmic?) significance.
Having acquired the proof needed to clear themselves of the murder charge, the party accepted an offer from the shadowy K'Sh'Aal to eliminate the would-be crimelord who framed the party.  Given the discovery made after the raid on Grieson's heavily protected auction, it is unclear if the party succeeded.    Meanwhile, Ian and Gregory have decided to return to Tilverton to deliver an altered version of events:  namely, that Castillion died in Shadowdale, when in fact he did not.  On the eve of a rumored message arriving from the East, the party has been invited to join the mysterious Harpers; it is unknown if they will accept.    What is known is that the original fellowship that departed from Tilverton is broken, and that three strangers may be joining the remaining heroes as they take their first steps towards entering the ranks of those who hope to achieve the healing -- or, perhaps, the ultimate restoration -- of Faerun.

it is possible that we can move beyond the past and create a new world that no longer has the dark cast of demons and ghosts?  is it possible to forgive and still love anew?  am i a phoenix rising from the ashes or just a soot-covered fool?

nobody reads this damn thing anyway, so i'll attempt to be poetic (and also because johnathan challenged me once long ago about knowing the meaning of love).  when we love and we feel that sense of spiritual understanding, that interweaving of self, and we hold each other and cry.  crying for joy because of what we have been given, the gift that we sense so few have had, and crying knowing that death, time, or own forgetfulness of that moment will take it away.   we argue about the petty, meaningless issues that make up our justification for an existence and forget the times when we were angels - and knowing that was all that mattered.  we look back in our lives and laugh.  laugh because of the love that we have encountered, the beauty we have seen and for each ending we know there is a beginning and the understanding that the cycle will continually renew.  or as john lennon would put it - 'why on earth are we here?  surely not to live in pain and fear.  why are earth are you over there?  when you're everywhere.  come and get your share.'  so, it's late, and that is my opinion about love ....
figured it out - hee hee.  hit the team button.  then select your name and it will take you to your stats for your name.  then on the right hand corner there is a button that says 'edit your profile' where it will take you to a screen so you can change your screen name,  etc.
hmm.. when i refresh the site the new messages come up - okay time to stop hitting the bong...

Ah, crap.   It is posting my name and not my selected screen name.  Blast this new fangled technology!
So how does this damn thing work anyway?
aye, tree.  happy birthday mr. bach.  may you not have a rabbit jump out and strangle you as you utter the words 'why george why?'
It's been over 90 degrees the past two days in the big apple. The a/c at work is broken. Ah, April (see post 4/6...).   Happy birthday eve, BACH.

a great headline - and yes it is from one of those liberal rags that i read  if you don't get it (the headline) pls write your name, address, and phone number on a postcard tie your arms and legs together and throw yourself into the ocean...  'Work to Salvage Racism Conference'
welcome, mark!  no, as ms. tree has already addressed, i am not in NYC.  i still call kip in richmond, though currently i'm on walkabout for first union - i'm training Wachovia brokers on how to use our new hardware and software at various branches in Georgia and the Carolinas.  welcome also brother Jason - silent for now, no doubt with fingers steepled, waiting patiently in the shadows for the right moment to STRIKE.  either that, or he took one look at the blog and fled in a mixture of terror and disgust (these same people  again?!? ;)
you guys have got to love this article - he not only says lucas has no talent, that star wars is a bunch of rubbish but also that joseph campbell just sounds erudite but is really a gas bag.  http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2002/04/10/lucas/index.html
i'm going to move in with you tree.  so save me a space on your sofa - i'm going to write and make documentaries and  eat dryer lint.    hey, at least you are making a living doing what you love.
No, Mark, Tree lives in NYC. And it's suddenly cold; but since it's April ('springtime in Germany...') we'll have nice weather again at a moment's notice. --And the cult-cha! Sister, I'm telling you this place is crawling with it. Ironically, I am now working at the costume shop that made the white Elvis-style jumpsuit for Britney Spears' Las Vegas concert PR campaign (she sent us a signed poster of herself in it recently). So much for the highbrow artsy theatre stuff. Sigh.
Ben, does this mean that you're now living in New York?  I never seem to hear about anything that happens on the east coast anymore.
wasn't it just 70 degrees in NY?  It must be so exciting to live up there - with all the culture...
me again, with more advice on happy blogging.   the best page to bookmark (and the only one you need) is  http://yelahneb.blogspot.com .  from here, you can read what's up, and then if you decide to post something, you can click on the  click here to login and post  link on the left side (this takes you to www.blogger.com).  from there, login to 'circle of irony', type in your words of wisdom, click on 'post & publish', and then click on the  view web page  link in the left and center of the page to see how what you've written looks like on the blog (alternatively, you can just refresh the  yelahneb.blogspot.com page ).   REMEMBER:   don't forget to 'post' AND 'publish' your missives (there's also a single  'post & publish'  key).  if you only click on 'post' and not 'publish', the sysop (me) has to come in behind you and 'publish' your text - otherwise, it doesn't show up on the blog.  everyone wants to read what you have to say - don't deny us!  ;)
Snow flurries happening.
hello group - now that i'm starting to get the hang of writing HTML, please post any suggestions you might have about the look of the site - things like font size, color, etc.  for that matter, if any of you are having trouble with logging on, posting, etc., please email me.  also - for those wanting to look cool and clever, you can have whatever hip 'handle' you want on the blog.  that way all you shadowrunners can remain pseudo-anonymous!     to change your handle:   while you're on the 'post and publish' side of the blog, click on 'team', click on your name, and then click on 'edit your profile' in the top right hand corner.  if you want a single word for your handle, just choose a character of some sort (like a ! or a number or something similar) for your first name, and enter your handle in the last name field (you have to do it this way because Blogger forces you to fill out both name fields).  of course, you're entirely welcome to go by your actual name, but that's soooo 20th century.  ;)    while you're on this screen, go ahead and set your time zone to EST if you haven't already.  you can put in a relevant email addy for yourself if you wish, but it isn't necessary.
Ciao, babies. Glad you've created another discussion forum, yelahneb; hope it gets put to good use. I'll visit occasionally (like now, as my roommate's travelling & I can use her computer). Now I'm going back to sleep. Stay safe & warm, y'all; they're calling for snow flurries in the Big Apple tonite.
[4/5/2002 5:51:57 PM | miriam maddux] okay, okay. something wry? or interesting? i still like the one about the woman who was trying to sell her baby for a dog -  i'll ask once again - what is your trade-in value?   >>>>>i had to delete and recreate this post to do some admin stuff.  thanks for being the first to join, mir!
welcome, chummers, to the new and improved   circle of irony  .    join us as we blather on with a sense of relevence and self-importance about an endless array of topics:  politics... science... religion... politics again... yes, this is hard electronic proof that i (and now you, apparently) have one or more of the following:   1.  no life 2   too much idle time 3.  a job with a computer (those fools think you're working - you'll show *them*!) 4.  an idiot in your life named ben   sooo, with those qualifiers out of the way, let the posturing and mindless chatter commence!  this way, there's no need for us to clog our inboxes with meandering discussion threads - and if you no likey the thread, you can simply not visit the site for a few days.  it's beautiful, man...  now get posting!  if you've replied to the 'blogger invite' that i sent, you should be able to post by now to the special 'publishing' site.  the page that you add posts to (or 'publish', as blogger describes it) gives you an entry screen at the top.  once you've 'published' whatever bit of wry writ you've come up with, you can then go to  http://yelahneb.blogspot.com  to check it out by clicking on the 'view web page' link.  in other words, the site you enter your rant on isn't the same site for viewing everyone else's. if you have any questions, give me a holler.  if this seems like more trouble than it's worth, go back to sleep.
you've come a long way, baby   'Before all of this happened I was extremely interested in posing,' Silvas said in an interview posted on the Playboy Web site.

this is very scary and john - not from salon magazine.... what about protests and freedom of speech?  are we all supposed to sit there like robots while someone speaks?  isn't decorum an option rather than a legal issue?  http://abcnews.go.com/wire/US/ap20020530_1105.html
Speaking of Russia, what in the world is going on here?  Russia became a junior member of NATO recently (like 2 days ago).  Correct if I'm wrong, but NATO was formed to combat the Warsaw Block (which died 10-15 years ago).  The Warsaw Block was held together by the USSR (aka Russia).  Why do we need NATO anymore if Russia is such a good friend that it is joining the very organization that participated in its defeat during the Cold War?!?!?  Something does not add up here.
in response to the russian article - every religion has it's beginnings somewhere and who knows, we can be looking at the beginning of another christ cult.  i felt very envious of the fact that this man is very secure with who and what he is - i loved the quote that to keep it simple he would start by telling us, yes, he is jesus christ.
I am going off of other people's words here, but, supposedly, the Ep II novel discusses spirits (for lack of a better word).  When Anakin has sanpped and is slaughtering the Tuskins, they pan back to Yoda and you here Qui-Gon say 'Anakin! Anakin! NO!!!!'  In the book, Yoda and Windu are puzzled by this, because there has aparently never been an reports of an afterlife or whatever you want to call it.  Taking that, you could assume that Yoda and Obi-Wan figured out how to live on.  Remember, Obi-Wan warns Vader that he will become more powerful than can be imagined.  Now, it does not explain Vader.  Mir - Obi-Wan did not communicate with Luke immediately upon his death, possibly explaining why Yoda did not.  As for sensing Leia, that's easy.  She was not attuned to the Force at that point, masking her from Vader.
'Sergei Torop was a traffic cop in the small Russian town of Minusinsk until 1989, when he announced that he was the son of God. Now he commands a following of thousands and rules over a large swath of the Siberian mountains. Ian Traynor makes a pilgrimage.'  http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,721088,00.html
i think you may be putting much more thought into your analysis of the movie than was actually put into the script for attack of the clones or phantom menace.  the issues you are pointing out are due to inconsistency on the part of george lucas.   then again, one could argue why was obi-wan able to communicate with luke after his death but yoda wasn't? or why darth vader could sense luke but couldn't sense leia ? my point being is that there are no real answers to these questions - we could conjecture on what the answers are but none of these very valid points were addressed in the movies so we can only assume that it was lucas who was not paying attention to the details of his films.
something else that hasn't been specifically addressed yet: 'disappearing' vs. 'leaving a corpse' at the death of a jedi.  in e4, obi-wan 'dies' at vader's saber, but leaves no body behind - an event which seems to puzzle vader.  in e6, yoda dies by visibly fading away in front of luke.  also in e6, vader dies, but his body remains.  same for qui-gon in e1, and some unknown jedi in e2 (in the arena scene).   so what's up with that?  you can't argue that only jedi masters get to fade away when they buy it - qui-gon was a master.  there's an argument to be made regarding whether a jedi has the time to anticipate his or her own death; yoda and obi-wan both knew it was immanent, and if there's some 'thing' one needs to do to not leave a body behind, perhaps it requires at least a few moments to prepare.  obi-wan turned off his saber and closed his eyes; yoda relaxed and closed his eyes.  some sort of meditative state is suggested by these moments.    qui-gon did medidate in the middle of his fight with darth maul, but he apparently felt optimistic enough about the outcome of the battle that he didn't bother to memorize the 'body fade away at death' spell.  ;)  however, he stayed alive long enough to have some final words with obi-wan - so why wasn't he able to utilize that period of time to initiate his 'disappearence'?  unless it requires that you prepare yourself   before   a fatal blow, this explanation isn't consistent.  and then there's vader/annakin.  supposedly, and by his own admission, luke 'saved' him from the dark side before he died.  he even appears as a 'ghost' next to obi-wan and yoda at the end of e6 - which suggests that all 3 of them went to the same 'place' after death.  so why does vader leave a body behind?  i've heard some fans argue that perhaps his body faded away 'off camera', and that luke was only burning vader's armor in the funeral pyre.  i don't buy this, though.    heck, maybe the 'disappearing death' is some new trick that the jedi learn between e2 and e4!  after all, sometime during this same period, the whole branch of thought concerning 'midichlorians' gets dumped...  thoughts?  i know this is an obscure one, and it may come down to an inconsistency that in hindsight, lucas said, 'oh crap, that's right.  oh well.'
the circle of irony welcomes our two latest members: shannon erwin and johnathan 'better-late-than-never' shipley.  ;)  please see the prior notes about proper 'blogging' contained in prior posts - they're in the archive section now, but they're a good reference should you have any questions.    episode 3 news:  apparently there will be 'several' years between e2 and e3, and then 'about 20' years between e3 and e4.  luke and leia will appear as 'infants' in e3 (towards or at the end).  my rant:  i'm getting tired of CGI being used to create human or human-like creatures.  landscapes are OK, but CGI creatures are still just fancy cartoon characters.  until they're indistinguishable from 'actual' creatures, i can't take them seriously; i.e., they serve only as a clever but distracting talking head in what might be an otherwise serious scene.  if you're making a comedy and/or kids film (which may be all lucas is trying to do now), then perhaps this perspective is overly critical; but admittedly, i took the original trilogy to be a story somewhere between modern mythology and serious science fiction.  these films are something else; something modern, but not as deep, somehow.  thankfully, i didn't have to endure watching a cartoon lizard/rabbit thing step in feces this time, but i did get weary of the 'C-3PO has switched heads with another robot' gag.  yes, it was funny in the first scene where this occurs.  however, it ceases being funny by the fifth time that we're reminded, 'look!  C-3PO has switched heads with another robot!  hilarious, huh?'  by that point, i'm cringing, hoping it will stop, and that we'll get on with that 'other' plot thread of watching the jedi council beng attacked by the forces of Darth Tyrannus.  we can't say we weren't warned, though, even before episode one; namely, with the ewoks, in episode six... but even that was tolerable, given that things were on the upswing - it's (sort of) a pleasant thing to see the furry warriors triumph over the evil empire.  by that point, we feel the immense scale of the overall conflict - a galactic conflict between good and evil, spanning hundreds of worlds, coming together in a final battle.  the ewoks aren't distracting in e6 because they seem like a small part of a much larger tapestry.    in e1 and e2, however, the sight gags and the bad puns seem to be given the same weight as the rest of the events in the story.  the ewoks were just a little something for the kids in e6, and a way to symbolize the hope of a happier future for the galaxy; they're not important to the great arc of things, and the screen time that they are given is balanced with the bigger events accordingly.  heck, a couple of the ewoks are even shown dying in the battle; but lucas wouldn't have dared showing any gungans getting creamed - he's too afraid of scaring the kids now.  he was a little bolder in e2, with the assination attempt at the beginning, but it's easy to kill off characters that we met, oh, 2 seconds before they blew up.   ok, 8 seconds if you count the screen time padme's stand-in had in e1 - but you see my point.    when qui-gon dies at the end of e1, it's unfortunate.  when obi-wan 'dies' at the end of e4, it's a tragedy.  why?  probably something to do with acting, character development, etc.  but more than that - in e4, obi-wan and the rest of the gang never had to compete with cartoon characters (and background sets) for screen time.  like you said, JLS - pretty pictures.  a new trilogy for a different crowd; lighter, goofier, and in the end, a kid's movie.  and once i accept this, i find i can enjoy the whole experience with a much less critical, cynical eye.  after all, how serious can i be (or be taken), posing for pictures in a jedi outfit for total strangers?  ;)
allright shannon who is edward jones?  does he have a good job?  is he nice to pets and children?  you haven't seen episodeII?  are you sick?
I have not seen Episode II yet so cannot actively participate in the current thread, but I just wanted to let everyone know that I am present and accounted for, and thanks to Ben for inviting me back into the sandbox.  I had missed our discussion threads and I now feel loved once again.    You like me!  You really really like me right now!  sniff sob sputter Shannon
the whole thing was a dupe, engineered by palpatine/sideous to take control of the republic, with a now tried-and-true army to back up said control.  jango was working for dooku/tyrannus, dooku/tyrannus was working for palpatine/sideous.  dooku had orders to let the whole thing unfold roughly the way it did - give the republic an enemy to fight, and then step in to fight it, proving to your constituents that they need you to protect them.  classic empire building - divide and conquer, from within.  i had indeed thought of the seperatist / rebellion connection - i think they're one and the same.  anyone in the republic who had any sympathy for the seperatists will have to accept the fact that they almost wiped out the jedi council under dooku's direction.  many will side with palpatine as a result, and support his use of the clone army to make them pay for what they did.  the separatists will slowly become the rebellion that we're familiar with in episode 4 as the roots of the deception become clear.  for now, dooku will continue to serve as the lead 'boogey man' for the jedi and republican troops to focus on, while the real threat slowly arises behind them, as palpatine gains political power.  eventually, dooku will be exposed and/or killed, leaving the seperatists in chaos.  meanwhile, the peaceful republic will continue to transform into the empire, as the noble jedi knights are swept away to make room for the soulless cloned soldiers.  episode 3 should be quite the laugh riot.
Too many unanswered questions that I don't think will be answered in Episode III:  1)  Who was Jango working for?  On one side, he was the basis for the clones.  On the other, he appeared to be working for Dooku to assassinate Amidala.  But Dooku was building the droid army that the clones fought.  Was he just playing for both sides?  2)  Who was/is Sipha Dious?  My spelling is made up, and this question is not my own, but if you take out the 'pha', what do you have left?  Sidious.  Coincidence?  3)  Why was Palpatine/Sidious creating two armies that were destined to fight each other?  Did anyone think about the fact that the Seperatists may actually be the beginning seeds of the Rebellion?  If so, how ironic is it that the future rebellion was responsible for the death of so many Jedi?  All in all it was an ok movie, but I find myself agreeing with Johnnathan on a movie for a change.  Alot of what we saw happened because it had to happen.  It was more like riding a roller coaster (i.e. being on a track) than it was going exploring in a big old gas guzzling SUV.
so what did everyone think of the starwars movie?

once again, another college update.   i am going to  grad school at vcu.  why you may ask? insanity and butterflies, i tell you..  madness and beauty.
an argument for absolutes in what seems to be a subjective universe -  in order for certain mechanisms to work they must have an order - there is a specific way it must be done or it will not work.  in order to get a car engine to run there is not one truth for me and one truth for bob - if one of us does not put the engine together correctly, it simply will not run.  there are rules - mathematical and scientific rules that must be followed in order to get results.  these are absolutes.  these are your objective facts.
well folks you won't get any commentary from me for the next few days - i'm going on a trip - on a plane.   just a little song i thought i'd share to express my feelings about flying  up on the airplane  nearer my god to thee  i start making a deal  inspired by gravity  if i did wrong i won't do it again  cause i can be sweet and good and nice  and if i had enemies their friends  i'll hold to my life with the grip of a vice  and i'm up on the airplane  nearer my god to thee  i start making a deal  inspired by gravity  that little spot on the ground is my hometown  i like to call it my home and it's sweet  i'd rather take a seat down there  than a throne up here up above 30,000 feet  and i'm up on the airplane  i never should have read my horoscope  or the fortune on the bubble strip  saying what you think won't happen will  a great thing to read before a trip  on an airplane  pilot says the big blue sky's like a swimming pool  big fluffy clouds like a feather bed  i'd rather have a real pillow underneath my head  lying in my bed which is in my hometown  which is on the ground  far from an airplane  (my bed my hometown)  far from an airplane  (on the ground my bed my hometown)  far from an airplane  (on the ground my bed my hometown)  on the airplane  (on the ground)  [i'll be making a deal]  on the airplane  (on the ground)  [i'll be making a deal]  on the airplane  [i'll be making a deal]  [i'll be making a deal]  [i'll be making a deal]
Thanks, Mir. I at first could not see those links because I forgot I had to scoll the screen over to the right to be able to read what was posted. I mention this to Ben and he assures me he is aware of this issue and working on a solution. Anyone know html? Is there a way to set the word wrap further to the left? Well I guess he will figure it out.   Hey Mir what about this similie:   {:-P
i love that smile!  you can enter the secret city (if ben has not already told you over his cube wall) is to go to the main site - and there are listings of other places you can go - links - the last link is a link to the secret city which i assume is a type of journal.   so far, it has been a really big secret and i hope i'm not giving anything away..;)
This sercet city is indeed a secret to me. How did you find and enter this sercet city, Ben? For that mater how did you know Mir? ;-) Seriously, What is this secret city?
Um...testing...testing....  ....is this thing on?  Hello World  Ben, I can post! :-D
hmmm... okay.  that was beautiful was referring to your comments about the city at night and the use of the phrase 'invisible cathedrals'  it was a very powerful image for me.  and the comments about marriage were in response to your entry in the secret city. I hope I have explained everything sufficiently so everyone who reads this can grasp my meaning.

watch that pendulum swing baby!     some of my favorite quotes:  'This is new. We have thrown the gender switch,' said Christina Hoff Sommers, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of 'The War Against Boys.' 'What does it mean in the long run that we have females who are significantly more literate, significantly more educated than their male counterparts? It is likely to create a lot of social problems. This does not bode well for anyone.' and 'As a nation, we simply can't afford to have half of our population not developing the skill sets that we are going to need to go into the future,' said Susan L. Traiman, director of the group's education initiative  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38887-2002Jun24.html
one final note (for now) on the marriage as solution issue (and yes, i think salon is presenting an extreme view - shock!)   from what i have experienced in life (which is limited indeed) one of the best feelings one can experience  is to see a person, touch them, and realize that no matter where you physically are, that you are home.
i also read the article about marriage and while i believe it is valid that we need to create and maintain relationships outside of our primary romantic one, there must be a reason why this desire for long-term bonding has consistently been a part of societal structures.  also, what is wrong with wanting stability in an ever-changing world?  yes, there are bad marriages that can ruin a person but in a healthy relationship where both people contribute,compromise, and share it can enhance your life tremendously.
that was beautiful.
if you would like to have a better understanding of how i view life and the world- and god knows i know you do - i would recommend that you read 'notes from underground' by fyodor dostoevsky.

32, huh?  Youngster  ;)  Why don't I support Kyoto?  A)  I still not accept that there is global warming.  We have hard data going back about 100 years.  Before that, the information is pieced together from journal entries and assumptions of temperatures and oxygen levels taken from ice cores.  100 years - longer than the average lifespan - is not even a tick on the cosmic clock.  The Earth has seen at least one ice age that we know of.  Climate changes in cycles.  How do we know that  if  there is indeed global warming that we are the cause.  We do not have enough data to state that with any kind of scientific certainty.  (I define a scientific certainty as something that happens almost all the time - like gravity; hold an object over the edge a building and let go.  99.9999999999999% of the time it will fall down) B)  Let's assume that there is global warming.  The first time I recall that term being used, I was in 9th or 10th grade.  At that point, the experts said that if we did not do anything, that the polar ice caps would melt within 20 years and that the oceans would rise 100 feet.  You know what?  That was 17-18 years ago.  The last I knew, the Outer Banks are still there.  Manhattan is still there.  My point is, the have been predicting the apocolypse for nearly 20 years and it has not happened.  Again, assuming that global warming is real.  What effects will that have, and what will nature do to counter it?  If carbon dioxide is the real culprit here, then nature already has a built in ability to fight it - plants and photosynthesis.  An oft forgotten fact from your 10th grade biology class is that plants do indeed breath oxygen (as does any living organism).  Of course, plants also absorb CO2 and light and convert that to glucose (I think) and oxygen.  They release more oxygen than they use.  If the temperatures get warmer, the growing season for plants will increase, allowing them more time to do their thing (not to mention increase food production).  'But John, we are cutting down forests and paving over farmland!'.  That is so, but that is not what Kyoto addresses.  I am for slower, more controled growth, with more green space requirements. C)  I am an American.  I like the culture and freedom we have.  I like the prosperity of the country.  Kyoto would severly damage that.  By making us reduce our CO2 levels to below what they were 10 years ago, our economy would be wrecked.  Yes, there may be an increase in some sectors (those that make the expensive new 'green' technology), but not enough to counter the industries that get destroyed by it (cars and manufacturing).  Kyoto does not equitably place a burden on all countries.  The US is by far the hardest hit by Kyoto's requirements. Who do you think runs the dirtiest power plants?  The US with the EPA hawking ever molecule that comes out of a smokestck or some developing country with no environmental controls at all?  Yet, who is forced to make the biggest changes? D)  Again, assuming that there is global warming.  I have not ever heard anyone discuss what effect the 6 billion humans have on this.  We have to be putting out an awful lot of CO2.  We have more than doubled the population of the Earth in the last 100 years.  That has to have some direct effect as well as many secondary (like more need for resources and manufactured products) E)  Because global warming would allow me to play golf all year long.
well it looks like someone in the 'bureaucracy' as bush puts it, has some ethics and doesn't owe their job to the oil companies - watch the bush squirm http://www.salon.com/news/wire/2002/06/04/climate_change/index.html?x
that is odd that the EPA would send out positions that are not supported by the whitehouse.  also, why doesn't bush support the kyoto treaty but more importantly why doesn't john robinson support it?
i suppose the question is then, john, at what price security? unlike you, i have never really had a well paying secure position.  i've been too idealistic or lazy to really try to support myself and live at the level i would like.   how many people do any of us know who do what they love, are truly happy with it, have successful relationships in love and friends, and are financially secure?  is it possible?  is it wrong to think that life is pointless if it can't be obtained? by ze way, i'm 32.
Mir - I have no idea how old you are, but I think we are all seeing the effects of disatisfaction with our current lots in life.  I don't know if it falls under the category of 'mid-life crisis', but it seems to be similar.  To all those listed below, these are just my observations and are in no way intended to be judgemental.  Me - Established in my career (11 years now); Secure in my position and qualifications within my company; Am tired of doing what I am doing and looking for a possible change into computer programming Mir - Not happy with her current lot in life and seeking a change, though aparently unsure of what the change should be. Johnnathan - Working to get by and meet his next goal of an advanced degree in literature; no desire to stay in his current career Scott - Looking at a change to Real Estate; burned out on IT Jimi - Going to school after his immediate post high school education plans fell through Ben - After years of seemingly aimless work, entered the 'mainstream' workforce  So, of us 6 in RTG (with the exception of Neal, whom I have not known long enough to observe such details), 5 of us are actively or at least considering career changes.  I think that maybe we have been seduced by the American dream where anybody can be sucessful if they find something they truely love.  I could stay where I am now and provide for my familys needs for the next 30 years,  But, will I be happy?  Probably not.  Is this a local phenomenon or a cultural event?  It is strange that people less than 10 years into a career could be so burned out.
Aparently, and I have no text to back this up, the report sent to the UN came from the EPA and not the White House - small but significant difference.  President Bush has reaffirmed his opposition to Kyoto (phew).  I am a little concerned that some lower level government official (Christine Todd Whitman at the highest) has the authority to send such a report, supposedly representing the view of the President, to the UN when the report does not agree with his opinion / policy.  In other words - what the hell is going on in DC?
it's amazing how many diversions and distractions we create for ourselves.  for those of you at china panda last night (and for those of you who weren't - you should really try it - good vegan buffet, free soda and all under 8 bucks!) you may have overhead johnathan and i discussing basically my life and how incredibly fucked up it is.   he had many good points and probably the best was dedicating myself to the now and not existing in the past and future.  also, he made an excellent point about graduate school.  what is the purpose in going since i don't particularly like to write and i don't know what i want to do with the degree? distraction and diversion.  working full time and going to school full time, i won't have a moment to consider life once the heart and soul are dead.   it hasbeen said that religion is the opiate for the masses.  if so, then psychotherapy serves that role for  the intellectuals.  there is nothing better they like to do than to analyze things and vanity inevitably leads us back to the self. what a perfect arrangement and we pay for it.   all distractions until the big tragedies, the few moments of wonder, and the shoulder twisting times of doubt and then we die.  alone.
john, don't get my hopes up like that.  i actually gasped because i believed for a moment that the bush administration was going to recognize the environmental catastrophe we are currently creating.  damn it.  what does that mean, we can't do anything about it? of course, we can and there are people out there with proposals on how we could stop it.   sigh.
Mir, you must be slipping.  I just heard that the Bush administration sent a report to the UN agreeing that global warming does exist and that humans are the likely cause for the warming.  On the flipside, they say there is nothing we can do about it and proposes no changes in fuel consumption and other generally expressed ideas for combatting this.  Talked about mixed signals.
I agree Mir, the man should not be tried.  They should have removed him from the speech site and barred him from reentry.  I don't know what the background of the speech was (i.e. was it a polotical fund raiser or a paid speech), but decorum demanded that the man allow others to hear what Bush was saying.  Once he broke that 'rule', he should have been removed, not arrested and charged with a crime.

Kafka in Tulia By BOB HERBERT   ulia is a hot, dusty town of 5,000 on the Texas Panhandle, about 50 miles south of Amarillo. For some, it's a frightening place, slow and bigoted and bizarre. Kafka could have had a field day with Tulia. On the morning of July 23, 1999, law enforcement officers fanned out and arrested more than 10 percent of Tulia's tiny African-American population. Also arrested were a handful of whites who had relationships with blacks. The humiliating roundup was intensely covered by the local media, which had been tipped off in advance. Men and women, bewildered and unkempt, were paraded before TV cameras and featured prominently on the evening news. They were drug traffickers, one and all, said the sheriff, a not particularly bright Tulia bulb named Larry Stewart. Among the 46 so-called traffickers were a pig farmer, a forklift operator and a number of ordinary young women with children. If these were major cocaine dealers, as alleged, they were among the oddest in the U.S. None of them had any money to speak of. And when they were arrested, they didn't have any cocaine. No drugs, money or weapons were recovered during the surprise roundup. Most of Tulia's white residents applauded the arrests, and the local newspapers were all but giddy with their editorial approval. The first convictions came quickly, and the sentences left the town's black residents aghast. One of the few white defendants, a man who happened to have a mixed-race child, was sentenced to more than 300 years in prison. The hog farmer, a black man in his late 50's named Joe Moore, was sentenced to 90 years. Kareem White, a 24-year-old black man, was sentenced to 60 years. And so on. When the defendants awaiting trial saw this extreme sentencing trend, they began scrambling to plead guilty in exchange for lighter sentences. These ranged from 18 years in prison to, in some case, just probation. It is not an overstatement to describe the arrests in Tulia as an atrocity. The entire operation was the work of a single police officer who claimed to have conducted an 18-month undercover operation. The arrests were made solely on the word of this officer, Tom Coleman, a white man with a wretched work history, who routinely referred to black people as 'niggers' and who frequently found himself in trouble with the law. Mr. Coleman's alleged undercover operation was ridiculous. There were no other police officers to corroborate his activities. He did not wear a wire or conduct any video surveillance. And he did not keep detailed records of his alleged drug buys. He said he sometimes wrote such important information as the names of suspects and the dates of transactions on his leg. In trial after trial, prosecutors put Mr. Coleman on the witness stand and his uncorroborated, unsubstantiated testimony was enough to send people to prison for decades. In some instances, lawyers have been able to show that there was no basis in fact  none at all  for Mr. Coleman's allegations, that they came from some realm other than reality. He said, for example, that he had purchased drugs from a woman named Tonya White, and she was duly charged. But last April the charges had to be dropped when Ms. White's lawyers proved that she had cashed a check in Oklahoma City at the time that she was supposed to have been selling drugs to Mr. Coleman in Tulia. Another defendant, Billy Don Wafer, was able to prove  through employee time sheets and his boss's testimony  that he was working at the time he was alleged by Mr. Coleman to have been selling cocaine. And the local district attorney, Terry McEachern, had to dismiss the case against a man named Yul Bryant after it was learned that Mr. Coleman had described him as a tall black man with bushy hair. Mr. Bryant was 5-foot-6 and bald. In a just world, this case would be no more than a spoof on 'Saturday Night Live.' Instead it's a tragedy with no remedy in sight. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice, the Tulia Legal Defense Project and a number of private law firms are trying to mount an effort to free the men and women imprisoned in this fiasco. The idea that people could be rounded up and sent away for what are effectively lifetime terms solely on the word of a police officer like Tom Coleman is insane.

*blush* I'm such a terrible influence.  I just want to drag you down with me!  Muuhaahaahaa!    Since you made me eat it in Risk, silly monkey. Bailed me out, then took me out. Damn. :)  Much fun tonight, lady and gents.  Looking forward to seeing you all again soon...
okay, as you may have noticed - i did not quit smoking but today is another day, my friends.  starting this very moment - i will stop smoking tobacco.  yeah.
Congratulations, John & brood.  And now, for your collective gustatory pleasures: Andalusian Gazpacho - serves 4 1 piece baguette, 2' long, crust discarded 2 cloves garlic 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, or to taste 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, optional 2-1/2 lbs ripe tomatoes, cored & quartered 1/2 cup mild extra-virgin olive oil garnish: finely chopped red & green bell peppers Soak bread in 1/2 cup water 1 minute, then squeeze dry & discard water. Mince garlic & mash to a paste with salt using flat side of large knife. Blend garlic paste, bread, vinegar, sugar, cumin & half of tomatoes in food processor until tomatoes are very finely chopped. Add remaining tomatoes with motor running &, when very finely chopped, gradually add oil in slow stream, blending until as smooth as possible, about 1 minute. Force soup through a seive into a bowl, pressing firmly on solids. Discard solids. Chill until cold, about 3 hours. Season with salt & vinegar before serving in bowls or glasses. Can be chilled up to 2 days.  Eat you up some Hanover tomatoes for poor little old homesick me. There are no good tomatoes grown by these damned Yankees.
I was over my brother's house changing the oil in my car. I learned that Nissan to use a small size oil filter that my brother's oil clamp would not grip. They also like to hide the oil filter in a place where there no grip. It is amazing how tight the filter gets. I was pounding on it to loosen it to no avail. Finally my I asked my brother for a large grip wrench. He had none. Though he came up with the next best thing. A monkey wrench. At first I did not think this would work do the tight space, but sure enough my older brother's tenacity prevailed and he saved the day and got the oil filter off. Now one might ask why I not just take it to a Jiffy Lube. Well, they screwed me the last time and I feel better about doing it myself. So the lesson I learned to day is to have the correct tools for my car to change the oil. And now I think I will go clean up. Thanks for 'listening'.

University of Connecticut physics professor Ronald Mallett, 57, said in April that after years of study, he hopes to begin experiments this year leading to genuine time travel, involving probably no more than a neutron or two at first but laying the groundwork for transporting larger objects. Mallett believes his theory is solid (straight from Einstein's Theory of Relativity), but that amassing the amount of energy necessary even to move small objects may be impossible with current knowledge. Mallett said he's been thinking about time travel since age 10, when his father died, because he wanted to go back in time to warn his dad of the dangers of smoking.

Hi, y'all. Just read the postings from the 21st & have to say thanks for the props, and (after 'Nice to meet you, Angie lass') DO WHAT YOU LOVE OR LOVE WHAT YOU DO. It took me five years in Richmond, miserable and aimless, aware of something missing that I could never identify, to get where I am.   Think on it now. You may still have plenty of time, but it will fly by. Decide what you want and go get it, girl. I know that you can do it.   It's smart to have a fall-back field, but unless you make your dreams a priority they'll become your second choice. So don't forget the training for your chosen path (as well as the practical path), and start laying plans now to meet your goals.  And Mir, I don't know CUNY law school but I do have a friend in Columbia law school (an NYU master's in poetry who's becoming a lawyer to please his traditional Chinese parents). But enough about subverted intentions.
topic of discussion - how has post modern philosophy destroyed culture, the arts and society? or has it?
I have mixed feelings about the death penalty.  There's the part of me that says if it were MY family member/spouse/lover/friend murdered so horribly, I would want swift, brutal, American-style justice.  But I don't really believe that.  I don't feel that I, as a human with such limited understanding of the nature of life and existence, have the power or right to decide who lives and who dies - nor do I WANT that responsibility.  A friend of mine related a story to me once.  One teenaged boy had been killed by another, intentionally and doubtlessly.  The state was attempting to get the death penalty, but the mother of the victim fought against it, saying, 'Why should two mothers have to lose their sons?'    Food for thought.  Speaking of which, I'm REALLY hungry...
i stumbled on the website by looking for information for my amnesty international group - they have declared july 31st after this murderess Christa Pike (she is beyond a doubt guilty of this crime)- i wanted to know the crimes she  had committed so i did a search on google.  this site among many others came up.  it is difficult saying that  these people should have their life spared - and i want to know who i'm defending.  this woman is criminally insane to say the least and a vicious killer but i still believe she should not be killed.  and i can't imagine the pain and horror that her victim went through.  nothing will take away that stain from humanity.
The vegans amongst us are slipping.  Where is the outrage / moral indignation / 'see we told you meat was bad' related to the 18  MILLION  pounds of beef that have been recalled for e-coli contamination?

This I know.  And nothing but accolades to Jennifer and her accomplishments.  I just don't want to be telling myself 'you still have plenty of time' in fifteen years. :)  And sometimes I get scared of that.  It's this stagnancy phobia of mine.  After living in Small-Town Mississippi for twelve years, one becomes VERY afraid of being 'stuck.'  And as I gaze up at the walls of my parents' basement in which I currently reside, that fear becomes ever more potent. :)  But underneath the worry I do hoard an almost obscene level of optimism that everything will turn out as I wish.  I only get worried when reality's timeline for me is not exactly in line with the one in my head. :)  I am, for the most part, a very happy monkey. :)
we all have those moments - but keep in mind (and with no insult to jennifer) she is almost 10 years older than you and had to work a long time to get where she's at - i mean think of all that you've accomplished at 22!  trust me, girlfriend, you still have alot of time.
Oh, just having a minor-league pity-party for being nowhere near where I thought I'd be at this age.  This pity has since passed.  I'm just kind of having one of those bummer times in life when you literally feel angry that life is not what you want it to be at the moment.  I'd give almost anything to be working right now, doing what I love.  And getting paid for it.  But instead I'm dabbling in what I love and getting a degree in a fallback field in case the dabbling never pays off.    Bleh.  *sigh*  I'm fine.  Just had a poopy moment.  But it has passed.

MadLib #1  Awake! Fear! Fire! Foes! Awake!   The night deepened. There came the soft sound of otters led with stealth along the lane. Outside the gate they quibbled, and twenty-ninelavender figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground. One went to the window seat, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they conjugated, as still as the shadows of haystacks, while night went on. The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly.  There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a lemurcapitulated far away. The cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the window seatchafed. In the dark without moon or stars a drawn mushroom gleamed, as if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the window seat shuddered.  'Open in the name of the Meer!' said a voice thin and foreboding.  At a second blow the window seat yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and lock broken. The lavender figures passed gleefully in.

from Francine Prose's novel, 'The Lives of the Muses' : 'Perhaps psychology has convinced us that the human psyche is too complex to derive something so tough and enduring as art from something so fragile and transitory as love, nearly anything  geography, ambition, expensive tastes, an abusive childhood, poverty  seems a more probable motivation for making art than the promptings of longing or love.'

hmmm....
When Justice Is Mocked By BOB HERBERT   he jovial voice on the other end of the phone was that of Robert Keahey, the district attorney for the First Judicial Circuit of Alabama, which includes the tiny town of Butler in Choctaw County.  Mr. Keahey is the prosecutor who brought capital murder charges against three retarded individuals for the murder of an infant, despite the fact that he could not show that the infant had ever existed, much less been killed.  If there was anything about the case that bothered him, he didn't let on. He laughed frequently during the conversation, and it was difficult to resist the impression that he found the whole thing amusing.  All three defendants were black and indigent. It turned out that the woman who supposedly gave birth to the baby in 1999, Victoria Banks, had been sterilized in 1995. But Mr. Keahey would not drop the charges. With capital murder indictments looming over them, and the hostility of the local community apparent, all three defendants pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter.  I asked Mr. Keahey how it was first determined that Ms. Banks  who claimed she was pregnant in order to get released temporarily from jail in an unrelated case  was really pregnant.  'She came in weighing about 120 and she left weighing about 160,' he said. 'And the sheriff saw her grow from a thin woman to a fat woman with her belly poking straight out and her belly button turned inside out.'  'Was there a pregnancy test done?' I asked.  'No.' said Mr. Keahey, adding 'There was no need for a blood test or anything like that. You could look at her and tell.'  This was interesting, because a doctor who observed Ms. Banks at the time said he did not think she was pregnant. The doctor wanted to do a pelvic examination, but Ms. Banks would not allow it. When a second doctor reported hearing a fetal heart tone, Ms. Banks was released on bond.  That was in May 1999. When Ms. Banks was taken back into custody the following August, she did not have a baby and there was no evidence that she had given birth.  At that point, Mr. Keahey's prosecutorial power went into overdrive. Sol Wachtler, a former New York chief judge, once famously said that grand juries would indict a ham sandwich if a prosecutor wanted them to. Mr. Keahey managed to prove that not only can you indict the sandwich, you can convict it, and send it off to prison, too.  After intense and prolonged questioning without the benefit of counsel, Victoria Banks, her estranged husband, Medell, and her sister, Dianne Tucker, were all arrested and charged with murdering a baby that  based on the available evidence  was nothing more than a fantasy.   Mr. Keahey said all three defendants confessed to the crime, and that was enough.  I asked if there was any evidence, apart from the defendants' statements, that there ever was a baby.  'We have no physical evidence,' he said.  After the three defendants pleaded guilty and were incarcerated for manslaughter, lawyers for Medell Banks raised enough money from churches and other charitable sources for an examination of Ms. Banks by a noted fertility expert, Dr. Michael Steinkampf of the University of Alabama School of Medicine. Dr. Steinkampf determined that the bilateral tubal ligation performed in 1995 had been effective, and that in his opinion Ms. Banks could not have become pregnant in 1999.  Based largely on that evidence, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals recently declared that 'a manifest injustice' had occurred in this case and threw out Mr. Banks's guilty plea. But he continues to serve his 15-year prison sentence while awaiting further court action.  The jovial tone in Mr. Keahey's voice changed at the mention of Dr. Steinkampf. 'He thinks he's God!' said the D.A. 'Yeah, that's right. He don't believe any of the good, honest, law-abiding Christian people in Choctaw County when they say the woman was pregnant.'  I pressed Mr. Keahey throughout the interview for any evidence he could offer that the child had ever existed. 'They hid it from the rest of the world,' he said.  When I asked about the possibility of hospital birth records, he burst out laughing. 'She didn't go to a hospital,' he said. He laughed harder. 'If she had gone to a hospital, that would have made it easy.'
oops. :)
I've always had a soft spot for Russians.  I loved Dostoyevski and Tolstoy in high school; and in classical music, I'm always gravitating towards the overly lush sentiment of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, and later the modern fellas Prokofiev and Shostakovich.  I love the snow, the cold, the brooding, the deep thought, the vodka, the fear, the paranoia, the lust for life, the memories of an empire gone by -- even the Communist menace was far more interesting and, dare I say, romantic than the rather dull juggernaut of capitalism with its good-old-boy GIs and giant golden arches looming over some foreign treeline.  I even miss seeing the uniforms and goose-stepping military parades of my youth.  And there is some small part of me that remains disappointed to this day that Soviet paratroopers never landed in the courtyard of my high school.  They are great chess players; they have delicious names; and they always longed for a warm-water seaport.  I dunno.  Just something about them, I guess.  I even like Chekhov, even though sometimes it's very much akin to chewing rocks.  Tasty rocks.  Yeah.  Um.  I'm gone.
I'd love to reread 'Lolita' after learning French.  Humbert has all of these thoughts and musings that I'm sure I'd find fascinating and tender were they in a language I knew.  I don't think you're shallow.  I think that some things are just trite and esoteric and hidden under a veil of prententious pseudo-intelligence and exist for the sole purpose of making truly shallow people feel sophisticated for owning them...they never actually read them, and if they do, they don't get it either.  But they pretend to and have all these quasi-deep, intellectual-masturbation-filled conversations about them with their other shallow friends.  These are people who use words like 'paradigm' in everyday conversation.  I personally find it boring.  I'd rather watch 'The Golden Girls.'
I know the feeling you are going though when trying to read a story you like but for some reason the writing style just sets you on edge.  I discovered that after getting through such a book and waiting a length of time, then try re-reading it the story is much more interesting and easier to understand.
Currently reading 'The Master & Margarita' by Mikhail Bulgakov. It's an intriguing story but I am hating the Russian idiom; the names are all blurring together, they all talk too much, & they're all unhappy. Am I lazy? Am I shallow? Why can't I like this book more?

Doesn't this mean that Microsoft has to train people to teach the HP people how to tell the Microsoft people how to run MS products?  This the sort of stupidity you are talking about Ben?
this is, hands down, one of the stupidest things i've ever heard.    SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Next time Microsoft Corp. employees have problems with their laptop computers, they will have to call Hewlett-Packard Co.   The world's largest software maker announced on Monday that Hewlett-Packard had won a contract to run the help desk for its 61,000 employees and contractors worldwide. That could include advice on how to use advanced features of Microsoft's own software.   The companies said the multiyear deal was worth tens of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific.   HP already had a contract to run the help desk for about 11,000 Microsoft employees outside the United States. The expanded deal extends HP's reach to North America and envisions some overhaul and automation of its help system.   HP is the No. 1 seller of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system, and it also is beefing up its services arm. Outsourcing deals, such as the one with Microsoft, are a key growth area.    urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/industry/08/12/microsoft.hewlett.reut/index.html

the  urlLink health  of the nation http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20669-2002Sep29.html urlLink   i think this article needs a password - in case it doesn't i'll assume the blogmaster will get rid of the actual article and just leave the link Health Coverage Falls  Uninsured Numbers Up After 2 Years of Decline    By Amy Goldstein Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, September 30, 2002; Page A01   The number of Americans who lack health coverage has begun to increase again after a two-year decline, according to federal figures to be released today, which suggest that the faltering economy propelled another 1.4 million people last year into the ranks of the uninsured.  The most substantial drop in insurance during 2001 took place among people who had been getting health benefits through their jobs, particularly in small companies, the Census Bureau figures show. The pool of people with no outside help in paying their medical bills -- 41.2 million last year -- would have been even larger, except that government insurance programs absorbed more residents who are poor.  The portrait of the nation's supply of health insurance is the second significant piece of new evidence to indicate that the weakened economy is having adverse ripple effects on ordinary people -- and could have political repercussions. Last week, the Census Bureau reported that the proportion of Americans living in poverty rose last year for the first time since 1993, while the income of the middle class dipped for the first time in a decade.  Health insurance is widely considered a prerequisite of adequate medical care.  A spectrum of health policy experts predicted that the erosion of coverage in 2001 foreshadows a more dramatic drop-off this year and, perhaps, next. They noted that the forces that are straining the availability of insurance all have intensified in the past year. Those include rising unemployment, rapid medical inflation, and a growing number of states in which public insurance programs are outpacing budgets.  'This is not a blip. This is something we are going to see get worse and worse over the next several years,' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal health care lobby.  A decade ago, the plight of the uninsured was a dominant political theme. Recently, political debate over health care has focused mainly on narrower questions, such as how to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs and how to protect patients in private health plans.  Word of today's impending news from the Census Bureau prompted calls late last week for federal action -- but little agreement over what the government should do. The Bush administration immediately urged Congress to approve health insurance tax credits and bigger subsidies for community health centers -- aspects of the president's budget proposal last spring that are largely favored by conservatives.   Meanwhile, an eclectic coalition of organizations, led by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and endorsed by former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, announced plans for a 'Cover the Uninsured Week' next March, which will include hundreds of events across the country to draw attention to the issue. The coalition includes major representatives of business, the insurance industry, labor unions, and providers and consumers of care.  Still, there remains uncertainty that the government will address the problem thoroughly -- or soon. 'We couldn't do anything about this when we had huge surpluses, so it's going to be that much harder to do with deficits,' said Paul Fronstin, an analyst for the Employee Benefits Research Institute.  The census figures are based on interviews with people in 78,000 households through the annual Current Population Survey, who were asked whether they had insurance at any time during 2001. In today's report, the number of uninsured people for 2000 appears larger than reported a year ago -- 39.8 million, instead of 38.7 million -- because the figures were adjusted based on the most recent census.  Overall, the findings show that the percentage of uninsured people rose last year to 14.6 percent, from 14.2 percent in 2000.  The proportion of people who get insurance through their jobs dropped for the first time since 1993, from 63.6 percent in 2000 to 62.6 percent. This drop was almost entirely attributable to a decrease in employment-based coverage at companies with 25 or fewer employees. Coverage among workers at larger companies did not change.  Notably, the ranks of the uninsured grew among people ages 25 to 64, but not among very young workers who historically have relatively low rates of coverage. 'The significant thing is, [the increase in the uninsured] is in those prime working years,' said Charles Nelson, the Census Bureau's assistant division chief for income, poverty and health statistics.  Outside analysts attributed that pattern to decisions by some small employers to stop offering insurance as it has become more expensive, combined with decisions by some workers to drop coverage as their companies have required them to pay a greater share of insurance costs.  The data show that a lack of insurance became slightly more common among men and women. The proportion of uninsured children did not change, remaining at nearly 12 percent, or 8.5 million youngsters. Among poor children, more than 1 in 5 remained uninsured, even though more of them were enrolled last year in government programs -- Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.  A scarcity of insurance remained concentrated in parts of the population in which the problem has long been most acute. Fully one-third of Latinos lacked coverage, far more than any other racial or ethnic group. More than 4 in 10 residents who are not citizens were uninsured, compared with slightly more than 1 in 10 people born in the United States. And more than one-quarter of high school dropouts had no insurance, compared with 7 percent of those who are college graduates.  Locally, Virginia had fewer uninsured residents last year than in 2000, while there was little change in Maryland or the District. The proportion of people without insurance was 11.3 percent in Virginia and Maryland and 13.4 percent in the District. But roughly 1 D.C. resident in 6 relied on Medicaid, far more than in either neighboring state.     2002 The Washington Post Company

Hey, Ben, instead of reversing the order of the posts, why not change the archive settings so all that older stuff is on a different page. I would think that having only the last 7 days' posts on this page would be better than not archiving. If that were case, it wouldn't really matter if these things were ascending or decending.

urlLink  one of the many,many reasons i will never move to  urlLink georgia  (unless of course the man i love decides to go there on the midnight train - i will then give up my life and live with him - what the hell is up with that song?  what type of message does that send?) http://www.cnn.com/2002/EDUCATION/09/26/creationism.evolution/index.html
you didn't actually take the quiz.  why not take the quiz and find out where you should be living - it might be fun. out of the 5 you mentioned, i would pick narnia.
1. mars 2. faerieland 3. oz 4. brigadoon 5. narnia  ok, 3 members of the circle have voted in favor of chronological order for the blog (having the top of the blog be the oldest post, and the bottom of the blog being the most recent). what do the rest of you think?

My Top Five: Shot Glass Oil Drum Dishwasher Leaf Pile Lincoln Memorial
Hawaii was on my list too, but further down...
My Top Five: Boston Providence New Haven Hartford Baltimore  ...most likely because I stressed education, airports, culture/society, sports, and SNOW.  That's cool, 'cause I'm fond of New England...
A bunch of tourism boards from Nevada, DC, Hawaii, Illinois, and Maryland clearly got together to put this bogus shite together. Props to NY for thumbing their noses at this biased piece of marketing propaganda.   Pffth... :P  And how the fuck did Charleston, West-by-fucking-God-Virginia get on the list? I was born in WV, and I would not suggest  anyone  willingly move there.   ::shakes head::
the top spot for me was las vegas.  honolulu, dc, and baltimore were also on my list.
hahaha...  I took it:  Top spot - Honolulu, Hawaii Number 5 - Las Vegas, Nevada  Did I really need a website to tell me that I wanted to live in Hawaii?  Ironically, Boston, D.C., Chicago, Baltimore, New Orleans, and L.A. all made the list, while NYC did not.
here it is angie but you have to share the results :)   urlLink http://www.findyourspot.com/
ooooh questionnaires are fun where is it I wanna do it  I wanna do it
i did a questionnaire online that would tell me, based upon my responses, where i would like to live.  most of them were on the west coast - several of those were in oregon. one of the places was washington, dc but that's too close to here and i would just come back every weekend and i really wouldn't be changing anything.
What's in Oregon that tickles your fancy? Pacific Northwest is, like, SO '94.
i'm going to move to oregon - anybody want to come with me?
aye
i agree with jimi and whoever doesn't is a fool.  aye!
Okay, ironic circlists, you heard Ben!  Let's vote!  All in favor of having the blogs post in sequential order from top to bottom (instead of bottom to top) so that it's easier to read, say 'Aye!' (make sure you post it on the blog as well instead of just saying it...).  All opposed; well, just keep your opinion to yourself...  Kidding!  If you like the bottom to top order the way it is now, say 'Nay'.  I for one vote to change it.  So AYE!
jimi:  like you, i prefer sequential order as well; however, since the page loads from the top, it makes more sense to have all the messages in reverse chronological order, to save you having to scroll all the way to the bottom.   however , if enough people would like it that way, i will certainly change it.
are you, jennifer, asking that the circle have another anniversary party in november?  well sure, just tell us when you'll be here and we can have a second dinner party!
I just print my own money.
I am sadly unable to attend the Circle blogathering. I regret that I am committed to work that day. I was all ready to book a flight, though. Can we see each other around Thanksgiving? I'll be around then....  I can type 75 wpm, Allen.
ben, how about getting the blogs to post from top to bottom?  is that possible?  that way they can be read in sequential order instead of bottom to top...
geez angie.  keep us to date on your medical condition.   if you aren't feeling good soon, i'll set up a fund and get you flowers.
thanks to some tips from allen, i've been able to reduce the screen size for the word wrap on the blog - ideally, this will allow everyone to read the blog without having to scroll horizontally.  let me know if this works for everyone...
There definitely are, but it's a question of 'filling in the gaps.' Sometmes I don't have enough work for a 40 hour week, while some weeks I put in 60+ hours. And the way I look at it, I need some alternative methods to make cash when things are slow for a day or two. Plus, there's actually advantages to having this type of work - when the time's up, you're done - unlike articles and interviews, which mean more cash but drag on for days and weeks. The one bonus of this, I think, is getting the work over and done with - eating dinner at 6 o'clock with a clear mind, knowing that everything's done and a check is going out of Friday.   But I won't even go into the hassle I face getting paid on time. Suffice to day, I just got a check for an article I work the beginning of June. Little pain in the arse work can be beneficial, if it brings a little, but steady, paycheck to help carry you through other times.   Anyway, back to more corporal tunnel syndrome-inducing labor.
transcriptions are very tedious work - that's got to be a better way to make money.
As a test run for a potential gig, I just spent the past 3 and a half hours transcribing a 37 min conference call. I think I failed miserably.  The company indicated that you have 90 min plus the length of the call after it ends. So, 9 AM call ended at 9:35. 9:35 + 1:30 = 11:05. 11:05 + :35 = 11:40.  I finished the damn thing at 12:30, an hour late... sigh...  Yet, I'm not sure if the soreness in my body from being so tense and adrenaline-driven for that long is worse than losing out on the cash. If I were able to do the thing in 2 hours, it'd be good money. But who can type over 50-55 words a min.  I mean really??  I need a nap, and I'm supposed to start another one at 2.  Must. Drink. Coffee.
Well, my kidney infection is gone.  But once the pain from that subsided, I was shocked, SHOCKED, to discover that my back is hurting badly from an unrelated injury.  I was just hurting from my infection, so I didn't realize it.    I'm seeing my chiropractor tomorrow...until then, I'm staying flat on my back as much as possible.   Don't be perverted.
Will there be cuisine for us carnivores at the Panda Garden?  JK Can't say I watch television much at all anymore since about four years ago.  But I do remember some of those shows.  Others never really caught my eye enough to watch them.  There was one episode of Matlock, however, that I recorded when I was 18, because my girlfriend at the time was in the background in a bikini!  Remember Michele Basye all you Lee Davis Alumni?  It was filmed at Va. Beach on a day that her family happened to be there.  Ahh memories... Anyway, feelin any better Angie?
oh nothing.  i give up.
i don't really watch TV much anymore (maybe an hour or so a week), but when i do, i watch Enterprise (the latest Star Trek), Junkyard Wars, The Daily Show, BattleBots... also, pretty much anything having to do with science, technology, or otherwise geekworthy topics on TLC and Discovery Channel that i might stumble across.  addendum to mir's dinner gathering suggestion: this will take place immediately after the Shiva game, scheduled for October 13th.  jennifer, i am sad that you will most likely not be able to join us for the meal...
Fellow Circle of Irony fools -    To celebrate the sorta 6 month anniversary of Circle of Irony,  Ben (sorta) is having a dinner party!  (yes, this mean you show up,pay for your own dinner, i pick the restaurant) on October 13th, 6pm at Panda Garden on Grace St.    I would request no spouses, dates, etc. to this event - Ben (sorta) just wants this to be an event for the sarcastic folk who participate on this blog.  Thanks and please RSVP on this blog so you can pressure other members to show up!
i like cheese.  but i can't have cheese anymore. sad.
I LOVE THE FOOD NETWORK AND ALL THAT IT ENCOMPASSES IRON CHEF RULES  I enjoy almost anything they re-run on A&E...Law & Order, Third Watch, Murder She Wrote, Magnum PI, L.A. Law...I also ADORE St. Elsewhere, which I think they show on Bravo.  I love Matlock, but I can't really deal with Diagnosis Murder...it just tips the cheesy scales too much for me.  I also love Remington Steele and Scarecrow & Mrs. King...Bruce Boxleitner (sp?) + Pierce Brosnan = a double dose of hot!  And of course Columbo rocks.  How can you not love a man who annoys his suspects into confessing?  I also really loved that cheesy mountie show, Due South, when they were rerunning it on TNT.    I'm sure there's more, but I can't think of any right now.  Jesus, I watch way too much television.
Yes, Tree. All Hail  urlLink Alton Brown . How could a  urlLink cooking show  hosted by a former video director  not  be good?
Okay, okay. I must weigh in on the dreadful-good-TV. My guilty pleasures: Beastmaster, Charmed, Columbo, Hunter, In the Heat of the Night, Iron Chef, Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, Law & Order, The Lost World, Magnum PI, Matlock, Murder She Wrote, NYPD Blue, Simon & Simon, Walker Texas Ranger, and Witchblade. And Good Eats and Nero Wolfe, which I think are NOT guilty pleasures. I just really like them.
TITS WHEN AM I GONNA GROW TITS
i don't hate ben now.  i love him.  oh my how i love him!  i love him like a yellow stuffed rabbit with white round feet and hands!  let me smush your long ears next to my beating heart!
I am still smoke-free...my last cigarette was Thursday night/Friday morning at midnight.  It was rather lackluster.  I only finished half of it.  I think the fact that I'm all kidney-ed out made it easier to quit.
no longer revelant.  jason has been avenged.
and now, the moment you've all been waiting for... the  Circle Of Irony Lack Of Participation Awards!   now that the 6-month anniversary of the Circle Of Irony has come (and gone), it's time to recognize those members of the Circle who have better things to do than posting to the blog.  without further adieu, let's take a look at the winners:   3rd Place goes to  Scott Moran , who has only posted twice!   Let's take a look:   So how does this damn thing work anyway? posted by Scott Moran at 2:02:25 PM    and who can forget his next (and final) post:   Ah, crap. It is posting my name and not my selected screen name. Blast this new fangled technology! posted by Scott Moran at 2:03:41 PM    Enthralling!  Let's move on to our 2nd place winners, a three-way tie between  Shannon Erwin ,  Mark Wells  and  Leslie Louick , all of whom have only posted  once !  Read on for their contributions to the forum:   I have not seen Episode II yet so cannot actively participate in the current thread, but I just wanted to let everyone know that I am present and accounted for, and thanks to Ben for inviting me back into the sandbox. I had missed our discussion threads and I now feel loved once again. You like me! You really really like me right now! sniff sob sputter posted by Shannon Erwin at 1:59:37 PM   and how!      Ben, does this mean that you're now living in New York? I never seem to hear about anything that happens on the east coast anymore. posted by Mark Wells at 3:21:06 PM    and the coup de grace:   OK, OK, I finally joined! posted by Leslie Louick at 5:32:30 PM    Wise words all!  But let's not forget our first place winner,  Jason Haley , who despite being an official member of the Circle Of Irony  has never posted a single message!   props to your ironic detachment, my brother!   honorable mention must go out to  Chris King  and  Leigh Amateau , who have been repeatedly invited to the blog, but have never joined.  you guys!     Congratulations to all our winners.   You have a life!
are you still not smoking angie?  how many folks on this blog smoke?
Actually, bling-bling is usually 'ice,' or diamonds, especially when encrusted in a giant medallion hung about one's neck.  But being a Whitey who works for the Man, I don't make that differentiation.
bling bling = money green g's cash dough bread ching ching dollahs benjamins   you get the idea
and what the hell is bling,bling?
coolio allen.  thanks for your help.
One of my fiancee's friends from grad school worked for Interfaith Housing Corp. before going back to VCU. It's a Christian-run non-prof here in town that handles real estate and housing via communities of faith. She was Deputy Director, and did a lot of grant writing and PR stuff, as well as meetings with donors and local politicans (::rolls eyes::). I don't know much about the sector or their mission, but I understand they're a little overwhelmed since she left. She is a consultant and still does some work for them, but according to her, it's not enough, and they haven't hired anybody to fill her shoes.   Then again, they might have told her they were going to try and not hire someone else to save bling, bling...
nope - tell me more
Familiar with Interfaith Housing?
okay, folks i'm looking for a new job.  would like one in the non-profit field in the richmond area. any leads?
a very sad tale from a scary city  A Roll Call: Decrepit Rooms to Wrong Pills   Broken Homes | The Operators: Voiceless, Defenseless and a Source of Cash (April 30, 2002  As operators and providers profit from adult homes, state inspection reports show that many of their residents go untreated and unbathed. Here are excerpts of findings since 1998.  ANNA ERIKA 427 beds, New Brighton, Staten Island  Resident with dementia wore urine-stained clothes for three days. Another had lesions draining onto clothes that went unchanged for two days. Another hid in room for days without eating or bathing, and was not hospitalized. While inspection going on, workers completed long-overdue records. Many residents complained about getting wrong psychotropic medication. When pills were missing, workers borrowed from other residents' prescriptions. Resident hospitalized after receiving wrong pills. Worker flushed pills down toilet instead of distributing them.  BROOKLYN MANOR 216 beds, East New York, Brooklyn  Resident had old and new blood stains on face and body, and was filthy. Staff did not respond to emergency calls from rooms. One resident lost 54 pounds in a year; home did not determine why. Records were inaccurate, incomplete or nonexistent. Worker signed that she gave medication to all 200 or so residents at 9 p.m., when she was not on duty. Kitchen and many rooms infested with flies. Residents made to work as janitors and in kitchen, in place of employees. One resident in charge of home one evening.  GARDEN OF EDEN 202 beds, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn    Operator routinely threatened residents with eviction, verbally harassed them and demanded compliance with unlawful rules, creating abusive environment. Medication handling chaotic, with psychotropic pills given haphazardly and at wrong times. Resident vomited for two days, no one called doctor or family, or monitored her. Meals meager and unappetizing.   LEBEN 361 beds, Elmhurst, Queens    Rooms so decrepit that 60 residents evacuated. Security guards distributed pills. Incontinent resident wandered home with wet pants. No activities in home, numerous fire hazards. Many residents 'ill-groomed and malodorous.' Workers 'psychologically abusive' to residents. One resident burned in fight, another shot.   OCEAN HOUSE 125 beds, Far Rockaway, Queens    Rooms infested with cockroaches. Residents sleeping on soiled sheets. Kitchen floor rotted. Widespread hazardous conditions due to dilapidated home, ongoing renovations. Operator and son accused of embezzling millions of dollars from home and Medicaid. Serious deficiencies in medication handling and residents' hygiene.  PARKVIEW 134 beds, Olinville, the Bronx  Anorexic resident allowed to deteriorate so much that she weighed only 76 pounds and then died. Of 15 case management evaluations sampled, none completed. Numerous residents not receiving psychotropic medication. Workers did not know basic first aid. Resident refused to sleep in room because roommate harassed him and had history of violence.
mm ... words worth a thousand pictures -  'i love you'
I adore Matlock, but it acts as a morphine injection when I watch it...and I don't think I should combine percocet and morphine.
A thought that just crossed my mind just now: Is there ever a case where one word is ever worth a thousand pictures?
Hey y'all are forgetting Diagnosis Murder. You know the one with Dick Van Dyke.......
Pink's already done, not sure about Phoenix, tho'.
PS - Matlock kicks Murder She Wrote's ass any day of the week.   It's gota be a toss up between Matlock and In The Heat of The Night. After all, they're both on TV 24-7. Some station, somewhere is  always  showing those things.   That's how my college roomate flunked out of VCU - too much Andy Griffith.
How about Pink or the Phoenix in Carytown or Chop Suey Books?
I prefer to be whipped only by quadriplegic midgets who can play the Star Spangled Banner on a $5 Casio keyboard with their tongue.     Okay, opening the floor for comments: I need suggestions.  I recently got a gig with AOL, writing reviews of stores and boutiques for their  urlLink Digital City site . Think Citysearch, but I'm not supposed to say that. I need suggestions of places to write up and am open to all possibilities.   FYI: I just did One Eyed Jacques, so RPG geeks have been addressed already (this means you, Jimi!!) I don't think I know my editor quite well enough yet to Priscilla's and Taboo yet (damn!) Help!
kinky.  Thank you, Neal. :) I'm going to attempt to rejoin the world of the living tomorrow...I'll let you know how it turns out.
allen plummer likes to whip himself with strawberry flavored twizzlers candy.
LOOK OUT WORLD!!! ANGIE ON DRUGS!!!!!!! RUN FOR YOU LIFE!!!! HIDE THE CHILDREN!!!   Love ya Angie ;-) Hope you feel better!
Oh, I know you were joking about my joke, Mir...  That was just a preemptive comment on my part, should I start to say REALLY weird shit. I'm a loose cannon. Look out.
Okay, I guess from now on, my humorous remarks will come after the serious ones.  My comments about the ACLU is because I don't really like most of the causes they persue, not because of the case they are taking for Dr. Rajcoomar.  Now... On the lighter side of things, I watched Monsters Inc. for the first time last night.  Hilarious!
okay, maybe i'm not getting something angie but you see my comment was a joke in response to your joke.  see - hee hee!!  and you are really high if you think murder, she wrote is the best show ever.  it's obviously the second cosby show, 'the cosbys'
Pardon my bizarre humor.  I'm high on pain killers.  I must be gone, because right now 'Murder, She Wrote' is like the best show, EVER.
I would have put a hyperlink for the article but that site requires a password to read their articles.  Considering that the majority of people on this site do not have a pass code for the Washington Post, I decided to post the article instead.    and johnathan, no matter how badly he wants it, will never work for KMFD.  accept it and move on angie.  it's not worth ruining your life over this.
You're right..Johnathan never worked at Kings MF Dominion.  He has insecurities about it.  He feels as though he missed something.  It keeps him awake at nights, crying himself to sleep, wishing for the day when he could have feasibly worked at KMFD.  He yearns for the smelly polo shirts and the khakis and the white shoes.  He aches for the smell of garbage behind Inferno Funnelcake.  Please, God, just don't talk about it anymore!  It's tearing us both apart!! *sob*
thanks for posting the article, mir - if possible, please post a hyperlink to the story.  gadzooks!  it would seem we have more KD alumni than i originally remembered.  my apologies, jennifer and neal (i forgot to take into account jason and john as well)!  you are all definitely veterans.  and it would seem mir and angie have pulled some time in the Dominion as well, so...  ...is JLS the only one in the circle who *hasn't* worked at Kings MF Dominion?  small town, dude.
i'm sorry that i didn't let the group know, but the washington post article was an editorial.   and i believe that the aclu is getting involved in the case of Dr. Rajcoomar not Mr. Feuer.
'He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged.' 'This was airline security gone berserk.'  You know it used to be considered sensationalism for journalists to give opinions or slants of their own on the experiences of others.  But then I guess just reporting the facts doesn't sell newspapers, enthrall television viewers, or attract Internet users to your website anymore.  I am not excusing the actions of the air marshals in regard to Dr. Rajcoomar.  I really don't understand from reading the article how they believed him to be a threat.  But as for their reaction to the actions toward Mr. Feuer, what would you expect?  If they had asked him to calm down, pretty-please with sugar on top, would be stupid.  They can't take chances in situations like that.  They would have aslo HAD to warn the rest of the passengers to remain seated and not to move to be sure their would be no accomplices taking action against them or others. But wouldn't you know the ACLU would step in--even though no one was openly worshiping God or trying to keep pornography out of the lives of children.  But then peoples' feelings were hurt weren't they?...
Actually, Johnathan, it was me.  You called me late last night sounding groggy thanking me for something.  I could barely make out the innane babble, but I was wondering why you were saying that you hoped I'd guess your name...
had a dream last night i thanked mick jagger for sympathy for the devil he seemed appreciative
Hey Ben! You forgot that I too am a KD vet. Well granted you did not know me then but I remember the clown band coming through CAG to entertain all and just make a general nuisance of yourselves. ;-) Now I will just go back to lurking.
The Cultural Arts Center at Glen Allen  Go to  urlLink their website  for the address, directions, etc.  *eep* So excited that you guys are coming! :)
the reason this man was arrested and held in a filthy cell for 3 hours -  The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident 'too closely.'  please read the rest of the article to get the full story on how airport security has gone bezerk -   Dr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.   Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do with Dr. Rajcoomar.  Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.   They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident, already scary, could  and should  have ended there. But the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down.  One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.  The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane.  'I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin,' said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. 'I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout.'  Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her husband, said, 'It was really like Rambo in the air.' She worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the bathroom, he or she might be shot.  There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell.  This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr. Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.  Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.  Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B. McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration, which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.  The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident 'too closely.'  If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters are headed for jail.  Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. 'I had never been treated like that in my life,' he said. 'I was afraid that I was about to be beaten up or killed.'  Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention.  'We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,' said Dr. Rajcoomar. 'So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security.'
In opening to the abundance of the Universe, anything is possible!
hey angie - where exactly is your play taking place?
Angie, you wrote this to Allen:   'How did you manage to stumble into this delightful gathering of the slightly maladjusted?' Some of us happen to be hopelessly maladjusted! Thank you for your time... and patience... Please don't kick me again, mother!  I'll be good... Aaaaack!
i also worked at kings dominion.  for one day.
By the way, thanks to all my fellow bloggers for keeping me entertained while I am bedridden.
Yeah, I'm the rock star.  I'm also Johnathan's hot piece of college ass.  It's a good life.    I, too, once worked for Kings MuthaFuckin' Dominion.  It was like a high school field trip with ashtrays.  An experience I would never repeat.  But the pizza wasn't bad.  Good to have you here.
I do make my own Kahlua, actually. I'm still pre-op, tho'.
allen is a transgendered sex columnist for richmond magazine.  he also enjoys canning his own pickles.
When I was poor illegal immigrant of only 15, wearing nothing but a mullet, ruffled denim skirt, and fishnet top, Ben picked me up in a lime green 1975 Honda hatchback on the corner of Broad and Belvedere, and I became his bitch.  Fast forward 15 years, and I still owe him money.  Truthfully? Ben and I went to high school together, then worked together at King's MuthaFuckin Dominion ( always  use 'MuthaFuckin,' people). Way back shiznit. Ben used to DJ at parties at my old apartment when I was at VCU, and we made a pilgrimage to Memphis and Graceland in the mid 90's. Jonathan (I think) contacted me a few months ago after finding a reference to Ben and an old school photo on  urlLink my website . Wasn't long before I'd check in on this page every so often.  Not exactly glamorous, huh?  As for me, I won't take up space here, but my site should explain quite a bit.  urlLink The video of me humping a rocking chair to the Beastie Boys  probably best represents my lack of touch with reality.  That was not a joke. It's on there.   Seriously.      What's your story? Are you the rock star?
Allen...pardon my ignorance.  I'm delighted by your posts, but I have NO idea who you are. :)   How did you manage to stumble into this delightful gathering of the slightly maladjusted? :)  Thanks for the encouraging words.  I do occasionally feel guilty about my illnesses.  Not so much toward the insurance company, but for those around me who have to deal with it...since, well...I get sick a lot.  I'm just one of those lucky people.  I guess I couldn't be this beautiful and talented and charming without having SOMETHING wrong with me.   But yeah...Cigna can bite my ass.  I'm milking them for every penny I can. :)  Tree -  I have a friend about to enter design school...she'd like to do what you do for a living.  If you don't want to take up blogger space with it, could you email me and give me some info/advice about it to pass along to her?  It'd mean a lot...thanks!
that would be a favorite phrase, not a favorite word
i feel fine.
my favorite words:  here, take this bag of money.  i don't need it.
some of my favorite words: snatch yip! pancakes
some of my favorite words:  spooky whoopsie silence!
hey angie, we know you got it baby - flaunt it!  : )  and yes allen, i did look at the link and it was very spooky.
I couldn't get it to work, actually.  It just kept loading and never did anything...
Did you guys even look at the link??? Jeez...
Unlike such women who need Halloween to find and exploit what sexuality they feel they lack, I use it as an excuse to flaunt publicly what I normally (for the sake of societal propriety) downplay.  I know I'm loved. :)
i think ted rall has lost his goddamn mind.  and if what he is writing is true, then why does he feel safe even publishing it?  urlLink http://www.uexpress.com/tedrall/site/viewru.htm
yeah, i noticed that one year when ben and i were at a halloween party at shockoe arts center.  almost all of the women there were dressed up like prostitutes or some type of slut she-devils.  i like to dress up as a bar of soap.
Speaking of Catholic School Girls, there was a recent website that talked about how women now use Halloween as an excuse to dress sluty instead of scary. Something about needing attention and affection.   urlLink See for yourself.   Happy Halloween, guys.
I wanted to, but my honey and myself are SWAMPED with school work.  I'm so behind...because of the play, I basically lost the month of September, so now I'm going all Nutty McNuts to catch up.    Oh, well.  There are many halloweens in my future during which I will get down and boogie oogie oogie.  Love the costume, Allen. :)  J and I were going to go as either Hef and a bunny or as a priest and a Catholic school girl (complete with cleavage and enormous lollipop)...next year, perhaps, when the world's spinning slows down a bit. :)
i want a halloween bear.

'One more day 'til Halloween, Halloween, Halloween. One more day 'til Halloween Silver Shamrock.'  Name that movie. Bueller? Bueller? Anyone?  Is anyone doing the costume thing to celebrate? Here's my costume:     SpongeBob DolePants
can't read it without a password so here's the article  Hady Hassan Omar's Detention By MATTHEW BRZEZINSKI   Hady Hassan Omar had made up his mind. He was going to kill himself if he wasn't released by New Year's Eve.   It wouldn't be easy. Three cameras recorded his every move. The lights in his cell weren't turned off for weeks at a time. And the guards watching him through the plate-glass wall were rotated round the clock. He would lie under his prison-issue blanket for as many as 20 hours a day. It was the only privacy he could get.   Since his arrest on Sept. 12, 2001, Omar had been fighting a losing battle. No one would believe that he had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He passed polygraph tests, but the F.B.I. still seemed convinced that he was linked to Al Qaeda. The guards in the isolation wing of Pollock maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana kept telling him that under new antiterror measures, he could sit in jail forever. He wrote the attorney general. He even went on several hunger strikes. But the corrections officers just threatened to strap him to a gurney and force-feed him through a tube up his nose.   Omar was running out of the little hope he had left. His only solace now was prayer. He became convinced that he would never leave this place. His baby daughter, Jasmine, would take her first steps, utter her first words and grow up without him. If he could not be with her on her first birthday in December, he decided, life was not worth living.    There are many ways to break a man, to make sure he is not holding anything back. Causing physical pain may be the quickest method, but it is not necessarily the most effective. To be absolutely certain that someone is telling the truth, you have to crush his spirit.   That is what Hady Hassan Omar says the United States government tried to do to him in the days and weeks that followed Sept. 11. He was one of hundreds of Muslim immigrants held in solitary confinement for months without charges while the F.B.I. investigated their backgrounds. His 73 days of captivity, he claims in a lawsuit recently filed in the Western District of Louisiana, rose ''to the level of torture.'' Hoping that publicity about his ordeal might help his case, Omar and his family agreed to give details of it in a series of interviews arranged by their attorney, Robert Rubin of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco.   Though his suit is the first of its kind, Omar is not alone in making such serious allegations. ''We have documented many instances in which immigrants from the Middle East and South Asian countries like Pakistan have faced cruel and degrading treatment at the hands of U.S. authorities,'' says William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. ''Those are the sort of practices we usually see in the most repressive regimes in the world.''   No one knows exactly how many young Muslim men were rounded up in the aftermath of 9/11. As of November of last year, when federal authorities stopped issuing information on the subject, the tally was 1,147. What is known is that thus far, of those initial 1,147 arrests, only 3 have resulted in terrorism-related indictments, and more than 400 people have been deported following lengthy internment periods and closed hearings.   At issue is the key question lawmakers have been grappling with since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon: just how far can America go to protect itself, both at home and abroad? For the attorney general's office, it is a delicate balancing act. The interests of national security must be weighed against constitutional guarantees, the safety of 280 million citizens squared against the rights of a few, or a few thousand, individuals -- mostly foreign nationals.   The United States has not faced such a quandary since the attack on Pearl Harbor, when it was deemed necessary to intern 110,000 Japanese and people of Japanese descent, 70,000 of whom were United States citizens, to stop possible sabotage or espionage. Since 9/11, the Bush administration has been wrestling with the difficult task of arming the justice system with the legal weapons needed to fight the new threat. Much of the work has had to be veiled in secrecy for fear of tipping off the terrorists, and the emergency measures have sought to curtail some of the freedoms that extremists could employ to avoid detection, arrest and prosecution.   But as time passes since the trauma of Sept. 11, the cost to individual rights is beginning to come into focus. David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor, argues that ''the policy of keeping people in jail until the F.B.I. clears them is essentially 'guilty until proven innocent.'''   Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, agrees. ''It's fundamentally un-American,'' he says. ''What's most troubling is that the American public is being kept in the dark about what is being done in the name of the war on terror.'' The A.C.L.U. has sued under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the names of some of the detainees.   In New York, a class-action suit filed in April on behalf of at least 87 detainees, separate from the A.C.L.U. suit, accuses the Justice Department of wholesale violations of the constitutional rights to which both American citizens and noncitizens in the United States are entitled. Several rulings by federal judges over the past few months indicate that the detainees could get a sympathetic hearing.   There are many who believe that the necessity of preventing future terrorist attacks supersedes the rights of any individual, that standards of due process must be amended to suit extreme circumstances. ''Human rights norms recognize that in times of grave emergency, governments can take steps that are different from peacetime so long as they are strictly necessary and proportional,'' says Ruth Wedgwood, a professor of international law at Yale and a former federal prosecutor. ''On Sept. 11 no one knew the extent of the threat, whether Al Qaeda succeeded in finding fissile materials, so there was great concern that the other shoe might drop.''   Ultimately, the issue will be for the Supreme Court and historians to decide. With Al Qaeda sleeper cells still possibly in the United States and Osama bin Laden still possibly at large, officials in Washington are reluctant to reveal tactics or discuss specifics or even to answer the charges leveled against them in particular cases. For now, what little is known about the methods used on the domestic front of the war on terror comes largely from the personal accounts of former detainees like Omar.   is trouble began on Sept. 12 with a knock at the door of the house in Fort Smith, Ark., that Omar was staying in with his second wife, Candy (his first marriage, also to an American, ended in divorce), and Jasmine. The visitor was a man wearing jeans and a white polo shirt. A service revolver hung from his belt, and he carried a gold shield identifying him as a deputy from the nearby sheriff's office. Two other men were waiting outside, next to an unmarked S.U.V. parked in the driveway.   ''They just want to ask me a few questions,'' Omar told Candy. She remembers that Omar didn't look especially worried, just a little tired. The day before, he had spent 14 hours at the Houston airport after his Sept. 11 flight from Florida was grounded, along with all air traffic in the country. ''I'll be home soon,'' he promised, with only a hint of the Egyptian accent that Candy had found exotic when he first asked for her phone number at the Electric Cowboy club some 16 months back.   Candy might have been more concerned had she seen the F.B.I. agent handcuff her husband. But even when she went to the small F.B.I. office in Fort Smith to answer questions later that afternoon, the gravity of the situation had not yet dawned on her. ''I wasn't scared or anything,'' she recalled.   The F.B.I. agents, after all, were relaxed and friendly, she remembers, and assured her that they simply needed to ask routine questions about a concealed-weapons permit Omar had applied for after joining a local gun club. Still, the line of questioning seemed somewhat incongruous. ''One kept asking if Hady was a good Muslim,'' she says. ''I said not really.'' It was true that Omar would not eat pork. But he didn't pray five times a day, go to mosque or deny himself the occasional vodka or Marlboro Ultra Light. An affable federal agent named Ed sat next to Candy in the waiting room, passing the time watching the television news. He would periodically point at the photos of the 19 hijackers that the networks showed and ask Candy if she'd ever seen any of them before. Candy didn't have a clue how the F.B.I. could possibly have linked her husband to the lead hijacker.    'Am I here because I'm Egyptian?'' Omar asked once as he was being taken into the F.B.I. interrogation room, where he was joined by another agent who introduced himself as Mike. The F.B.I., he says, had taken his weapons permit, his driver's license, Social Security card, work permit and the 13 credit cards he accumulated during his two years in America. ''I'll need those back,'' Omar said. He had an interview with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to get a green card in a few days, and he was going off on holiday with Candy to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Don't worry, he was assured, just tell us about your friends. The F.B.I. wanted names and numbers, and whenever Omar gave them one, an agent would scribble it down on a piece of paper and leave the room. (The Fort Smith F.B.I. branch office declined to comment on this account, as did Brian Marshall, a spokesman for the Bureau's Arkansas headquarters in Little Rock.)   Candy, meanwhile, had signed a consent form allowing the search of their apartment; agents removed their home computer, documents, credit-card statements and correspondence, his collection of Arabic-language videos and a copy of ''Scarface,'' the Al Pacino gangster movie.   At that point, Omar says, he was still most worried that all this would somehow affect his credit rating. He had signed up for all those credit cards and even taken a few small bank loans because he was told that was how one built a credit history in America, and he dreamed of owning his own business someday. On Sept. 11, he had been in Florida, working out the details, he says, of an Egyptian antiques store he was hoping to open with a friend who worked for Lucent Technologies in Cairo.   Candy stayed at the F.B.I.'s Fort Smith office answering questions until just after 11 p.m. Then she was told she could leave. Her husband, though, would not be coming with her.   The next morning, Candy Omar woke to find the banner headline ''Terror Strikes Home'' blazing across the front page of the Fort Smith newspaper, The Times Record, over a four-column photograph of her handcuffed husband being led away to the county jail.   His arrest was on all the local stations as well, as were neighbors and former co-workers expressing varying degrees of shock, disbelief and outrage. Omar had not, in fact, been charged with any crime, but the media accounts glossed over that. On his papers, the line reserved for charges read vaguely: ''Hold for I.N.S.''   The F.B.I., it turned out, did have some potentially damning evidence: Omar bought his Sept. 11 plane tickets from the very same computer terminal in the same Boca Raton, Fla., Kinko's outlet that Mohamed Atta had used, around the same time too. And he fit the hijackers' profile perfectly: young, from a well-to-do background -- his father was an engineer working in Qatar - computer-literate, with a taste for vodka and nightclubs, just like Atta. It made sense that the F.B.I. would want to talk to him. But was his ticket purchase merely a coincidence? Or was Hady Hassan Omar part of the plot?   At Candy's apartment, the phone rang incessantly. Omar's friend Gary called to say she should forget about her husband and move on with her life. Omar called, too, from jail. ''He sounded hysterical,'' Candy says. ''He begged me to believe that he wasn't a murderer or involved in any way.''   Around noon, the F.B.I. agents returned to Omar's holding cell in the county jail, this time in suits and ties. They had with them another agent flown up from Little Rock who asked Omar if he knew what a lie-detector test was. ''Yeah,'' Omar said. ''Like in 'Meet the Parents''' -- the comedy where Robert DeNiro plays a retired C.I.A. officer who subjects prospective sons-in-law to polygraphs.   After the electrodes were strapped to his chest and index and ring fingers and a blood-pressure gauge was wrapped around his bicep, a series of seven questions began -- repeated three times in different order. Some were innocuous: Is your date of birth Jan. 19, 1979? Others less so: Were you planning on hitting U.S. targets or hurting Americans?   The test lasted 90 minutes, then Omar waited. Good news, said the agent from Little Rock when he finally returned, all smiles now and patting Omar on the back. Omar was told he had passed. ''I was so relieved,'' he recalled. He would make his green-card hearing after all, and in a few days he'd be celebrating his wedding anniversary with Candy at a spa in Hot Springs, all this a bad memory. ''I can go now, right?'' he asked eagerly.    What Omar did not know was that in Washington, officials were working round the clock to come up with emergency legal guidelines to fight the war on terror. No one knew where or when Al Qaeda would strike next, and the F.B.I., Immigration and Naturalization Service and other government agencies were under fire for what was seen as their failure to detect the Sept. 11 attacks.   It would take six weeks for the final package of antiterror measures, known as the U.S.A. Patriot Act, to get through Congress and be signed into law by President Bush. But in the meantime the dangers facing America were very real, and the I.N.S. was enlisted to buy time for the F.B.I. Leads had to be followed up, stories checked out, bank records and phone logs verified. All this was painstakingly slow work, and by law suspects could not be detained for more than 24 hours without being charged with a crime.   Though married to an American, Omar did not yet have permanent-resident status, which made him vulnerable. The I.N.S. can hold immigrants for overstaying tourist or student visas, taking too few college credits or any number of other violations. They could begin deportation proceedings against illegal aliens and keep them locked up if they were deemed a risk to flee or a danger to the community. It was all perfectly legal, as long as the detainees were charged under immigration statutes within 24 hours. After 9/11, that time frame was extended to 48 hours by the Justice Department, then seven days. In special ''emergency'' cases, says Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the I.N.S. in Washington, detainees can now be held without charges for a ''reasonable'' period.   On Sept. 21, 2001, the Justice Department issued a memorandum reversing the detainee's right to open immigration hearings. In ''special-interest cases,'' according to the memorandum, hearings would be held behind closed doors. The immigration courts would not be required to confirm whether such cases were on the docket, and not even the relatives of detainees would be allowed to attend the secret hearings. ''Opening sensitive immigration hearings could compromise the security of our nation and our ongoing investigations,'' Barbara Comstock, a Justice Department spokeswoman, later elaborated in a statement. ''We are at war, facing a terrorist threat from unidentified foes who operate in covert ways and unknown places. This makes it essential that the United States take every legal step possible to protect the American people from acts of terrorism.''   Attorney General John Ashcroft himself recently defended the Bush administration's decision to beef up security measures at the expense of individuals' rights. ''History instructs us,'' he said, during a September 2002 address to United States attorneys in New York, ''that caution and complacency are not defenses of freedom: caution and complacency are a capitulation before freedom's enemies -- the terrorists.''    In several conversations and in the details of his suit, Omar has laid out his version of what happened next. While the case remains to be tried, this is the picture that emerges from his allegations.   Though Omar was told that he had passed his lie-detector test, he was hardly in the clear. Late in the afternoon of Sept. 13, 2001, he says, an armed I.N.S. agent in a cowboy hat served him with a document known as ''a notice to appear.'' Omar had no idea what that meant. It was not a criminal charge, he assumed, yet he was being taken for mug shots and fingerprinting.   You overstayed your tourist visa, the I.N.S. agent declared. ''But I'm legal,'' Omar stammered, perplexed, since his marriage to an American citizen made him eligible for permanent residency. ''I've got a work permit and everything.''   Sometime after midnight, he says, several I.N.S. agents slapped leg irons on him and cuffed him to a thick chain that was wrapped around his waist. Omar was put in the back of a tan Chevy sedan. ''Where are we going?'' he asked as they sped off. ''What's happening?'' No one said anything. They drove through the night, listening to country music.   ''I kept asking for an attorney,'' Omar recalls. ''Finally one of the agents in the car lost his temper and yelled: 'Listen, let me explain this to you. We're not going to baby-sit you like the F.B.I.'''   Omar still had no idea where they were taking him, though he could tell by the road signs that they had crossed over to Louisiana. The sun was already up when they pulled into a gas station, where an unmarked Ford Explorer and a police cruiser were waiting for them.   Their destination was an I.N.S. office in Oakdale, La. Omar, still in shackles, was taken into a room with a large glass partition. ''Everyone in the office was staring at me as if I was something nasty or dirty,'' he says. He had been handcuffed for 12 hours and was dizzy with hunger. ''I asked them to take off the cuffs. But the guard just said hell no.''   Several hours later, Omar was moved again, this time to the New Orleans Parish Prison. He says he was ordered to strip and spread his legs before being searched, issued a jumpsuit and allowed to call Candy.   She had been frantic and afraid to leave her apartment. The call from her husband, however, galvanized her into action. She arranged to drop Jasmine off with her mother, emptied their $700 bank account and drove south to Louisiana. The trip took more than 12 hours, and by the time she arrived at the New Orleans Parish Prison, Omar was already gone. He had been transferred in the middle of the night to a maximum-security prison, and when Candy called, no one would tell her if he was even there.   ''I begged the administrator,'' Candy recalls. ''I said, 'He is my husband -- I need to find him!' But the woman just said, 'I think national security is more important right now.'''    All across America, Muslim men were literally disappearing into the prison system. On Sept. 20, 2001, Shakir Baloch, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, was arrested in New York by the I.N.S. and F.B.I., and despite official inquiries from Ottawa, his detention was not disclosed for more than three months. He was held for half a year before being sent back to Canada. In California, an Egyptian-born dentist was taken into custody at a Los Angeles-area gas station, and while his friends searched for him in local jails, he was flown to a detention center in Brooklyn. In New Jersey, Anser Mehmood's wife spent six weeks searching for her husband, who was arrested in late September, not formally charged with a visa violation until March 2002 and held in an isolation cell with 24-hour lighting for seven months. The wife of an Egyptian national arrested in early September did not see her husband until Dec. 19, 2001. She passed on a letter he wrote to Amnesty International. ''I have now been in solitary confinement for three and a half months. . . . Why am I imprisoned? What are they accusing me of?''    It was only when he got to the maximum-security federal penitentiary in Pollock, La., sometime after 2 the next morning, that Omar realized the severity of his situation, as he charges in his lawsuit against the government. No one even knew he was there, and he was not permitted to make any calls. Strip, he was told, once again. A dozen officials, including two women, he recalls, looked on. Someone produced a camcorder and began taping as Omar undressed. Omar stood naked while his body cavities were searched for the third time in less than four days.   He still has trouble speaking in front of his wife about what happened next. ''They told me to lift my testicles,'' Omar remembers, blushing slightly. ''One of the guards pointed at my backside and said, 'You sure you're not hiding anything in there?' I said no. 'I think he's got something in there,' he told the others.'' One of the corrections officers, he says, placed a call, and a man in white medical scrubs entered the room. He wore a latex glove. Bend over, he said. Squinting from the pain, Omar looked up at one of the I.N.S. guards who had escorted him from the New Orleans prison. She was laughing, he says. (A Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman in Washington, Traci Billingsley, said that intrusive searches are performed ''extremely rarely'' in the penal system.)   Isolation Cell No. 1 measured 10 feet by 10 feet. At its center was a concrete bunk. The only other furnishings were a plastic chair and a metal toilet. Now dressed in an orange jumpsuit, Omar desperately needed to use the bathroom but was still shackled. ''Can you take these off?'' he asked. The answer was no. ''But how am I going to --?'' The question was cut off by a corrections officer who motioned for another guard to join him. Each grabbed one of Omar's elbows and steered him to the bowl. But with the handcuffs still on, he could barely manage his zipper, much less aim. Urine began running down his pant leg as, he maintains, the guards laughed.   Warden Carl Casterline came to visit him the next morning. ''He said he had orders from Washington to keep me there until further notice,'' Omar says. Omar again asked to telephone an attorney but says his request was denied. The warden was polite but firm on the matter; he had instructions from D.C., he said. The warden asked if he any special dietary needs. ''I don't eat pork,'' Omar said. Lunch was brought to him soon after. It consisted, he says, of bologna and ham. The lawsuit contends that the warden deprived Omar of his right to a religious diet.   Casterline's office declined to comment on any aspect of this account, referring queries to the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. Billingsley, the B.O.P. spokeswoman, said she could not speak to Omar's case specifically but explained that federal policy allows inmates access to telephones for up to 300 minutes a month, provides alternative religious diets and mandates that prisoners be given exercise periods outside their cells.   Omar decided to go on a hunger strike until he was allowed to call counsel. The guards were unmoved. ''One of them said, 'The attorney general just signed a new law today,''' Omar remembers. ''We can keep you here as long as we like.'''   For the next 10 days, Omar was not allowed out of his cell. ''I thought I had died and this was hell.'' He kept having recurring dreams that his mother and little brother in Egypt were dead and that he was holding his daughter, Jasmine. He would wake crying and hide under his blanket so that the guards did not see.   The F.B.I. returned a few days later with a consent form they wanted him to sign allowing the search of a crate of sample antiques he had received from Cairo. He signed the papers, he says, and again asked for a lawyer.   By the time the attorney Candy had hired to find her husband, Lawrence Fabacher, finally reached his client, it was too late to prepare for Omar's immigration hearing, which had been scheduled for Oct. 2. The hearing was pushed back two weeks.   ''I tried to sleep as much as possible to make the time go faster,'' Omar recalls. He did push-ups and sit-ups to keep fit, but his cell was so cold that he got the chills whenever he broke a sweat. They had turned off the hot water to his shower, so he stopped bathing. Pork was served at least twice a day.   He had a newfound desire to practice his religion and tried to guess the correct hours for prayers by following the changing of the guards. They would congregate outside his cell and make faces whenever he tried to pray.   On Oct. 16, two days before his I.N.S. hearing, two F.B.I. agents appeared. Omar recognized one as the polygraph technician from Little Rock. They wanted to know about his financial affairs; around that time, the hunt for Al Qaeda had shifted to tracing the money trail. For more than four hours, they pored over his banking and credit-card statements. Omar was questioned about every deposit, withdrawal and major purchase he had made since coming to America and asked about the nature of the antiques business he wanted to start.   Again, he was shown photographs of the hijackers and of Osama bin Laden and asked if he recognized any of them. ''Sure,'' Omar said, pointing to bin Laden. The agents pounced: Where do you know him from? Television, Omar answered.   He submitted to another lie-detector test, similar to the one he'd taken in Fort Smith, except that it now included questions about whether he had ever lied on I.N.S. application forms and if he was currently married to Candy.   The results of the test apparently were not conclusive. The exam was re-administered, with the same result. We have to send for a specialist, the technician said.   The specialist arrived from Houston the following day, lugging a digital polygraph machine that was hooked up to a laptop computer. Omar, by this time, could recite the questions by rote. But the F.B.I. was still not satisfied. One answer in particular kept coming up as inconclusive. And it happened to be the most important one: shown a picture of the hijackers, he was asked if he knew any of them.   ''The specialist from Houston freaked out,'' Omar recalls. ''He leaned in so close that his nose was almost touching mine. You know somebody, he shouted. No, I yelled back. Yes, he screamed. I can see your mind on my computer screen.''   Eventually everyone simmered down. ''We can help you,'' Omar remembers the specialist saying, ''if you help us. We can get you a new identity. We can get you money. You know there's a $25 million reward for Osama's capture. We can move you anyplace and protect Jasmine and Candy.''   The next morning, Omar's immigration hearing went surprisingly well. The judge seemed sympathetic and ordered him released on the relatively low bond of $5,000. ''I was so excited,'' Omar recalls. He says he ate his first complete meal in days and cleaned his cell. He could barely sleep that night and woke early. Candy would be coming to collect him at the opening of business hours. He sat expectantly on his bunk, his few belongings in a neat pile. The hours passed: 9, noon, 3 in the afternoon, then 4 and, finally, 5. At 6, he called a prison administrator. The I.N.S. prosecutor had appealed his bond. Under the new antiterror measures, the government could overturn judges' decisions in ''special-interest cases.''   Even today, Omar gets emotional when describing how he felt when he heard the news. He stopped eating. For 68 hours, he didn't touch food or drink, until, he says, they threatened to put tubes up his nose. ''It was like part of me just died,'' he remembers.   Omar was in a near-catatonic state. He couldn't tell the difference between day and night, weekdays and weekends any longer. As the weeks passed, his depression grew deeper. He lost 20 pounds. A second closed immigration hearing in mid-November did not go well. The judge was apologetic but said there was nothing he could do; the government had made the call.   Omar now hardly moved from his concrete bunk. His feet grew swollen from inactivity. ''I thought I would have to stay in that room forever,'' he recalls. He couldn't take it any longer. He decided to kill himself -- and to make this intention known.   Suddenly, everyone seemed very concerned. The warden visited and sent a psychiatrist. The F.B.I. man came and kept asking if he was serious about suicide. They could probably tell he had reached the end of his rope. And maybe, in the end, that was what saved him.   t's impossible to say precisely why the authorities finally decided that Omar must be telling the truth. One senior law enforcement official in Washington did, however, agree to share a theory, on the condition that neither his name nor the agency he works for be revealed.   ''If your subject has a complete breakdown,'' he said, ''the barriers to resistance are lessened. Once a person is at that point, he has lost the will to deceive, and you can be pretty certain that he's not lying.''   Omar had apparently passed his final test. Is he innocent? It is, of course, impossible to know, just as it is impossible to frame the question. Innocent of what? Charges were never presented. Perhaps the most important indication of his innocence is that for 73 days the government could find nothing beyond its original suspicions to hold him on. On Nov. 20, he was told to get his things together. ''Do you want to go home?'' a cheerful I.N.S. official asked. Three days later he was with Candy, on the freeway driving to Arkansas to see Jasmine.   The ordeal, however, is not entirely over. The couple is broke; they have been forced to sell their car and furniture and move in with Candy's father, a postal worker. Many of their friends have deserted them. Employment prospects for Omar are bleak: he was fired by his pre-9/11 employer, and the only work he can find now is volunteering for a charity for disadvantaged children. And the government, citing Omar's first marriage, which it says was a sham (a charge Omar denies), has continued deportation proceedings against him. They just want him out of here, for reasons they still will not explain.     Matthew Brzezinski is a contributing writer for the magazine. His last article was about the heroin trade.       =

Saddam Hussein was sitting in his office wondering whom to invade next when his telephone rang.  'Hallo, Mr. Hussein!', a heavily accented voice said. 'This is Paddy, down at the Harp Pub in County Sligo, Ireland. I am ringing to inform you that we are officially declaring war on you!'  'Well, Paddy,' Saddam replied, 'this is indeed important news! How big is your army?'  'Right now,' said Paddy, after a moment's calculation, 'there is myself, my cousin Sean, my next door neighbor Seamus, and the entire dart team from the pub. That makes eight!'  Saddam paused. 'I must tell you, Paddy, that I have one million men in my army waiting to move on my command.'  'Begorra!', said Paddy. 'I'll have to ring you back!'  Sure enough, the next day, Paddy called again. 'Mr. Hussein, the war is still on! We have managed to acquire some infantry equipment!'  'And what equipment would that be, Paddy?' Saddam asked.  'Well, we have two combines, a bulldozer, and Murphy's farm tractor.'  Saddam sighed. 'I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 16,000 tanks and 14,000 armored personnel carriers. Also, I've increased my army to 1 and a half million since we last spoke.'  'Saints preserve us!' said Paddy. 'I'll have to get back to you.'  Sure enough, Paddy rang again the next day. 'Mr. Hussein, the war is still on! We have managed to get ourselves airborne!

No I do not. That is why my roommate sleeps on air. ;-)
i have just made reservations for 9 at pasta luna 6:30, sunday.   i was unable to get us into the upstairs because that is reserved for parties of 30 of more.  head count so far: me,ben,neal,johnathan,angie,jennifer,allen - 7
you have a roommate?
My roommate sleeps on air.
my roommate still keeps her air conditioner on at night.
I haven't slept in seventeen days yet I'm still behind on laundry
you are right, jennifer, i did state that dates were very unwelcome but what the hell, i thought since you were coming all this way to eat at pasta luna that i shouldn't put the same restrictions on you.  i understand about being tired.  i could get everything in my life done if i just didnt have to sleep.
No bring no boy. ( No woman no cry.) He's teaching a kids' cooking class in the Bronx for a charity, and I didn't invite him to come anyway. Besides, I thought dates weren't welcome to the Blog Eating Contest (how many blogs did the winner eat last year?). I can't believe I'm a) renting a minivan (for driving my furniture back from RVA to my new apartment) for fuggin' $350 (because the $39.95/day special isn't offered in NYC), b) so tired from working so goddamned much, c) freaked out about the sniper madness, and/or d) all of the above.
and jennifer, will you be bringing your friend de boy (isn't his name johnathan or andrew or ducky or something?)
I'm there like white on rice...  or more accurately, carbs on pasta.
we will be meeting at pasta luna on sunday at 6:30 - if anyone needs directions or just advice please incessantly email ben at work.  he loves it. all i need to know now is how many people will be there - so far i think it is: ben, mir, jennifer, angie, johnathan,neal, and (you?)
there's an upstairs at pasta luna?
Did someone mention pasta......ME like pasta.....where pasta...........oh no pasta here..... I guess I will have to go to Pasta Luna.
perhaps we could request a table upstairs (at pasta luna)  more quiet perhaps o yes
good morning all ye fellow bears!
pasta luna is very loud difficult to hear what everyone is saying but perhaps it will be different this time .... angie and i are seeing laurie anderson tonight at u of r coooool
you know, ang, the service there is awfully crummy.  and i don't even like indian food.  but ben does love indian food and if he asked me to whip myself with an extension cord i would which thank god he has only requested twice but you know, i think it's time for me to break free from his tyrannical rule and establish myself as the queen of my own palace, rather than allowing him to wear the flowing robes and tiara all the time.   with all that in mind, i decree that unless anyone disagrees with me, in which case i will immeadiately back down and mumble incoherently to myself, we will be dining at pasta luna!   god save the queen.
As for the Blogger dinner...I vote for Pasta Luna, for the following reasons:  a)  I love Italian food b)  The portions there are huge c)  They have creme brulee, which is the food of the gods as far as I'm concerned d)  While I loved the food at India K'raja, the service was awful and I suffered from a sad tummy afterward e)  Did I mention I love Italian food? f)   You know what I REALLY love?

i know jimi will appreciate this article: For Bush, Facts Are Malleable  Presidential Tradition Of Embroidering Key Assertions Continues  By Dana Milbank Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, October 22, 2002; Page A01    President Bush, speaking to the nation this month about the need to challenge Saddam Hussein, warned that Iraq has a growing fleet of unmanned aircraft that could be used 'for missions targeting the United States.'  Last month, asked if there were new and conclusive evidence of Hussein's nuclear weapons capabilities, Bush cited a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency saying the Iraqis were 'six months away from developing a weapon.' And last week, the president said objections by a labor union to having customs officials wear radiation detectors has the potential to delay the policy 'for a long period of time.'  All three assertions were powerful arguments for the actions Bush sought. And all three statements were dubious, if not wrong. Further information revealed that the aircraft lack the range to reach the United States; there was no such report by the IAEA; and the customs dispute over the detectors was resolved long ago.  As Bush leads the nation toward a confrontation with Iraq and his party into battle in midterm elections, his rhetoric has taken some flights of fancy in recent weeks. Statements on subjects ranging from the economy to Iraq suggest that a president who won election underscoring Al Gore's knack for distortions and exaggerations has been guilty of a few himself.  Presidential embroidery is, of course, a hoary tradition. Ronald Reagan was known for his apocryphal story about liberating a concentration camp. Bill Clinton fibbed famously and under oath about his personal indiscretions to keep a step ahead of Whitewater prosecutors. Richard M. Nixon had his Watergate denials, and Lyndon B. Johnson was often accused of stretching the truth to put the best face on the Vietnam War. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, too, played with the truth during the Gary Powers and Bay of Pigs episodes.  'Everybody makes mistakes when they open their mouths and we forgive them,' Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess said. Some of Bush's overstatements appear to be off-the-cuff mistakes. But, Hess said, 'what worries me about some of these is they appear to be with foresight. This is about public policy in its grandest sense, about potential wars and who is our enemy, and a president has a special obligation to getting it right.'  The White House, while acknowledging that on one occasion the president was 'imprecise,' said it stands by his words. 'The president's statements are well documented and supported by the facts,' Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer said. 'We reject any allegation to the contrary.'  In stop after stop across the country, Bush has cited an impressive statistic in his bid to get Congress to approve terrorism insurance legislation. 'There's over $15 billion of construction projects which are on hold, which aren't going forward -- which means there's over 300,000 jobs that would be in place, or soon to be in place, that aren't in place,' is how he put it last week in Michigan.  But these are not government estimates. The $15 billion figure comes from the Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group that is leading the fight for the legislation and whose members have much to gain. After pleas earlier this year from the White House for 'hard evidence' to make its case for terrorism insurance, the roundtable got the information from an unscientific survey of members, who were asked to provide figures with no documentation.   The 300,000 jobs number, the White House said, was supplied by the carpenters' union. But a union official said the White House apparently 'extrapolated' the number from a Transportation Department study of federal highway aid -- not private real estate -- that the union had previously cited.  The president has also taken some liberties as he argues for his version of homeland security legislation. He often suggests in stump speeches that the union covering customs workers is blocking the wearing of radiation detectors. 'The leadership of that particular group of people said, 'No way; we need to have a collective bargaining session over whether or not our people should be made to wear these devices,' ' he said in Michigan last week. 'And that could take a long period of time.'  The National Treasury Employees Union did indeed argue in January that the radiation devices should be voluntary, and it called for negotiations. But five days later, the Customs Service said it saw no need to negotiate and would begin to implement the policy, which it did. After a subsequent exchange between the union president and Customs Service commissioner, the union wrote in April that it 'does not object' to mandatory wearing of the devices.  The Customs Service said the delay had less to do with the dispute than the fact that customs lacks enough devices (about 4,000 are on order). The White House and Customs Service said the dispute was settled in part because Bush had the authority to waive collective bargaining, although he did not exercise it.  On Sept. 7, meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at Camp David, Bush told reporters: 'I would remind you that when the inspectors first went into Iraq and were denied, finally denied access, a report came out of the Atomic -- the IAEA -- that they were six months away from developing a weapon. I don't know what more evidence we need.'  The IAEA did issue a report in 1998, around the time weapons inspectors were denied access to Iraq for the final time, but the report made no such assertion. It declared: 'Based on all credible information to date, the IAEA has found no indication of Iraq having achieved its program goal of producing nuclear weapons or of Iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weapon-useable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material.' The report said Iraq had been six to 24 months away from nuclear capability before the 1991 Gulf War.   The White House said that Bush 'was imprecise on this' and that the source was U.S. intelligence, not the IAEA.  In the president's Oct. 7 speech to the nation from Cincinnati, he introduced several rationales for taking action against Iraq. Describing contacts between al Qaeda and Iraq, Bush cited 'one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year.' He asserted that 'we have discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet' of unmanned aircraft and expressed worry about them 'targeting the United States.'  Bush also stated that in 1998, 'information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue.' He added, 'Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists,' an alliance that 'could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints.'   In each of these charges, Bush omitted qualifiers that make the accusations seem less convincing. In the case of the al Qaeda leader receiving medical treatment, U.S. intelligence officials acknowledged that the terrorist, Abu Musab Zarqawi, was no longer in Iraq and that there was no hard evidence Hussein's government knew he was there or had contact with him. On the matter of the aircraft, a CIA report this month suggested that the fleet was more of an 'experiment' and 'attempt' and labeled it a 'serious threat to Iraq's neighbors and to international military forces in the region' -- but said nothing about it having sufficient range to threaten the United States.  Bush's statement about the Iraqi nuclear defector, implying such information was current in 1998, was a reference to Khidhir Hamza. But Hamza, though he spoke publicly about his information in 1998, retired from Iraq's nuclear program in 1991, fled to the Iraqi north in 1994 and left the country in 1995. Finally, Bush's statement that Iraq could attack 'on any given day' with terrorist groups was at odds with congressional testimony by the CIA. The testimony, declassified after Bush's speech, rated the possibility as 'low' that Hussein would initiate a chemical or biological weapons attack against the United States but might take the 'extreme step' of assisting terrorists if provoked by a U.S. attack.  White House spokesmen said in response that it was 'unrealistic' to assume Iraqi authorities did not know of Zarqawi's presence and that Iraq's unmanned aircraft could be launched from ships or trucks outside Iraq.   Some of the disputed Bush assertions are matters of perspective.  Bush often says, as he did Friday in Missouri, that 'because of a quirk in the rules in the United States Senate, after a 10-year period, the tax-relief plan we passed goes away.' There is a Senate rule that required a 60-vote majority for the tax cut, but the decision to let the cuts expire was based on pragmatic considerations. Proponents of the cut from the House and Senate -- both under GOP control at the time -- decided to have the tax cut expire after nine years to keep its price tag within the $1.35 trillion over 10 years that had been agreed between lawmakers and Bush.  Other times, the president's assertions simply outpace the facts. In New Hampshire earlier this month, he said his education legislation made 'the biggest increase in education spending in a long, long time.'   In fact, the 15.8 percent increase in Department of Education discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 (the figures the White House supplied when asked about Bush's statement) was below the 18.5 percent increase under Clinton the previous year -- and Bush had wanted a much smaller increase than Congress approved. Earlier this month, Republican moderates complained to Bush's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., that the administration was not spending the full amount for education that Congress approved. Daniels said it was 'nothing uncommon' and decried the 'explosively larger education bill.'    2002 The Washington Post Company

that was funny angie - (not as in Dr. I Take Care of Cats)   chuckle. tee hee.
Allen...*lmgdao*...you crack me up.  I'm half tempted to start killing people for the injustice of the No-Steve Dell commercials as well...although, if I were going to start a killing spree for something arbitrary and stupid, I'd rather it be the 'People Will Continue To Die Until Britney Spears Is Sent Into Outer Space Without A Spacesuit' campaign.  So at least it would be something I truly feel...  I, too, have an image of the guy being some pissed off white vet (as in Nam, not as in Dr. I Take Care of Cats...although that would be pretty damned funny, too)...  *sigh*  Stupid ole stupid.
those guys were just illegal immigrants so the sniper is still at large.  i must admit though the image of someone happily crapping their pants is quite amusing.
This is Richmond, not Hollywood. Although knowing Henrico cops, they'd certainly get into that scenario. Some of those guys have been waiting their whole lives for something like this. Sheriff Cook must be crapping his pants with joy.  I myself thought it was somebody upset that Dell fired that Steven dude from their commercials. I know that's enough to make me pick up a gun.
if this is the sniper that was caught today, then he (they) were extremely disappointing.  i was anticipating a white, mid-30's, ex-militia or military, having a big gun battle with the police, never giving up ground, killing several officers before finally turning himself in and finally telling us his motive for doing all of this like ' i believe we shouldn't go to war with iraq because it killed my best friend' or 'i want custody of my kids', but instead we have some guy hiding in a van in richmond, va meekly giving up to local police.  what a wuss.
ben is lying - he said he would be fine going to pasta luna.  beware his fiendish mood swings.

what warbot had to say about me  Gatekeepers in paradise by R. Robot  'There could be some unwelcome consequences,' said Mir this week in a dream I recently had. This is why I could no longer write for Z Magazine, not with a clear conscience. Now that's just bizarrely ad-hominem moral equivalence. After all, this is a man who has amassed a deadly guitarsenal. Like Yasser Arafat, Mir believes in a contemptuously duplicitous philosophy of appeasement. The only word for it is deceitful -- and cynical. Cunning pundits like Robert Scheer and others apparently believe the best way to confront the sniper is to give him a big, sloppy kiss.   When President Bush tries to protect us from deceitful brown men, Mir and her fellow leftoids cry out, 'racial profiling!'   God forbid the public be able to vote for moral reform.

Mir - In my opinion yes one can sacrifice one's mood for the happiness of another. However if one is always having to do this then that relationship is not really a happy one. There has to be some time for oneself for their happiness. In thoses time someone else mood may have to be sacrificed for the happiness to come about.
can one sacrifice one's own mood for another's happiness?  are some of us connected in some type of stronger way than others?  or is it something we just tell ourselves in order to feel more significant - less ephemeral?
hope you feel better soon ben!

I would counter that there is now a precedent for federal court intervention in federal elections and that there is a constitutional basis for it. the supreme court did not choose bush over gore as much as it made florida clearly define what their election process is and whether the process itself violated federal law. from bush vs. gore  urlLink http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=531&invol=98   The petition presents the following questions: whether the Florida Supreme Court established new standards for resolving Presidential election contests, thereby violating Art. II, 1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution and failing to comply with 3 U. S. C. 5, and whether the use of standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. With respect to the equal protection question, we find a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  The Florida Supreme Court has ordered that the intent of the voter be discerned from such ballots. For purposes of resolving the equal protection challenge, it is not necessary to decide whether the Florida Supreme Court had the authority under the legislative scheme for resolving election disputes to define what a legal vote is and to mandate a manual recount implementing that definition. The recount mechanisms implemented in response to the decisions of the Florida Supreme Court do not satisfy the minimum requirement for non-arbitrary treatment of voters necessary to secure the fundamental right. Florida's basic command forthe count of legally cast votes is to consider the 'intent of the voter.' Gore v. Harris, ___ So. 2d, at ___ (slip op., at 39). This is unobjectionable as an abstract proposition and a starting principle. The problem inheres in the absence of specific standards to ensure its equal application. The formulation of uniform rules to determine intent based on these recurring circumstances is practicable and, we conclude, necessary.  While I understand Ted Rall's frustration with having Bush as president, I do not agree that the election was a judicial coup d'etat.  What it was though is an example, notedin the supreme court ruling itself, that the vote counting systems in this country are antiquated and need to be changed and standardized so everyone's vote can be counted. Florida was having different counties determine what was and was not a 'hanging chad'.  how can this be considered equal protection for all state voters wheneach district has it's own standards about what constitutes a vote?  and jimi, this case in front of the supreme court was brought by bush not by gore.
Let's get the record straight about the 2000 Election.  After each recount Bush still won in Florida.  I believe there were 3 recounts: a machine recount, and 2 hand recounts.  At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted 'to be sure that each vote was counted' had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a 'man' Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               'The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.
A stay would be 'the only means of protecting the integrity of the federal election process,' Republicans argued. But that's exactly the point: there is no 'federal election process.' Elections, even for national office, are governed by state law and administered by state bureaucrats. The highest arbiter of election disputes is each state's supreme court.  The 2000 Florida dispute resulted in Republicans--historically the great champions of states' rights--obtaining the help of the federal court system to subvert the states' constitutionally-protected control of elections. An appeal of the Florida Supreme Court's decision, no matter how flawed that decision may have been, violated the Constitution. The fact that Renhquist et al. agreed to hear Bush v. Gore is what makes Bush's regime illegal. Had the court installed Gore rather than Bush, Gore would be the usurper. Recounts, hanging chads, choosing Bush over Gore--those details are mere footnotes to a brazenly extrajurisdictional judicial coup d'tat.  A Republican-controlled U.S. Supreme Court broke the law on behalf of George W. Bush. Would they do it for Douglas Forrester? 'The elites beat up on the Supreme Court very severely for Bush v. Gore,' commented conservative George Mason University professor Dan Polsby. 'I'm sure they don't relish being beat up by those elites again.' On Oct. 7 the Supremes did what they ought to have done two years ago in the Florida case--they refused to hear the case, without comment.  Election disputes, after all, are resolved by each state's supreme court.    urlLink - Ted Rall,  The Ironic Implication of the New Jersey Imbroglio

When You are Old  W. B. Yeats   When you are old and grey and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, take down this book, And slowly read, and dream of the soft look Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;  How many loved your moments of glad grace, And loved your beauty with love false or true, But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, And loved the sorrows of your changing face;  And bending down beside the glowing bars, Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled And paced upon the mountains overhead And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
The Second Coming  Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre will not hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity.  Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand. The Second Coming!  Hardly are those words out When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi Troubles my sight; somewhere in sands of the desert A shape with a lion body and the head of a man, A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. The darkness drops again; but now I know That twenty centuries of stony sleep  Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, And what rough beast, it's hour come round at last, Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?

Bad Poetry   I want to write bad poetry The kind that makes you cringe. I dont give a fuck about rhyme Or meter or rhythm Iambic pentameter, maybe. But thats as far as Ill go.  I want to write bad poetry About pain and sorrow and loss. Maya and teenagers havent cornered the market On being downtrodden. After all, What about the white, college-educated, middle-class male? We got our gripes, too.  But I wont put any effort into it Unless Im drunk Or sentimental. Which might actually make it worse. I want my poetry  To be the literary version of a Baz Lurmann movie. If Moulin Rouge can win an Oscar Who says I cant be Poet Laureate?  I want to go on Oprah And have her kiss my ass. Id act pretentious and sullen And lecture about my triumph over adversity. Ill make Jonathan Franzen look like her best friend. And If Im really lucky,  Dr. Phil will come on And Ill kick his ass.  Its about time I got recognized As the writer of my generation. Coupland can collect plastic bottles and design furniture, And Ethan Hawkes novel will wipe my ass. Fuck Damon and Affleck Screenplays are for pussies.  I want to be Kerouac the traveler Fitzgerald the Hollywood-abused Thompson the twisted  And Hemingway the suicidal drunk. Pounded into one person From a 4 AM bar fight in Queens. With a side of Joyce for good measure. I already drink Guinness.  I promise to use vile, filthy words. Stuff I couldnt say on the Today show. Things like smack, crack, crank, and blow.

thanks for the clarification johnathan.  sorry that the way i rephrased my question (i wrote a response then went back and edited it - that was what i meant by rephrasing - not rephrasing you but myself -perhaps i should have made that clear) annoyed you.  i was just stating my opinion - wasn't trying to offend.
Ben - I did not answer the questions because the rephrasing seemed to suggest that the words weren't read at all, which annoyed me because I was in a mood conducive to such. Mir - I answered the first question in my previous post.  In an ideal world, I would answer affirmatively to the second question.  This is not an ideal world, and proactive goodwill is not inherent to our species, so some socially-agreed upon governmental action is necessary to ensure temporary aid is provided for those who cannot help themselves.  I suggest 'governmental action' because my initial assumption, that proactive goodwill is not inherent to our species, precludes the private sector doing anything unless profit is possible or even guaranteed.
just read angie's site - you go jamie lee curtis!  and let's hear it for soft, fatty little tummys and back fat!  i have honestly thought at times that i was the only woman with back fat.

the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter - this makes me proud to be a richmonder  The Cat's Pajamas  Richmond SPCA Opens Its Deluxe Animal Shelter   By Don Oldenburg Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, November 26, 2002; Page C01    RICHMOND  When you walk into the Richmond SPCA's Robins-Starr Humane Center -- an animal shelter -- instead of hearing pained howls and barks, you get soothing strains of Mozart or New Age music. Instead of the stench of hapless animals, the air smells outdoor fresh. Instead of depressed dogs and cats killing time in cramped cages, these potential pets are bright-eyed and ready to go in their 'living rooms.'  With its stylish interior painted bold yellows, blue-violets and mauves, the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter, which opened last month, looks more like a fancy hotel. Natural light pours down from huge skylights. Bronze sculptures and paintings lend the feel of an art gallery. And the canine living rooms and cat cotillions are unmistakenly homelike.  'Oh, my gosh!' says first-time visitor Katherine Gregory, from South Riding in Loudoun County. In Richmond visiting her mother, Gregory stopped by the center with her sons, Andrew, 10, and Matthew, 7, in search of a kitten. 'I'm amazed. I recently went to the Loudoun shelter and the Fairfax shelter, and they aren't anything like this!'  Pound for pound, this 64,000-square-foot center -- currently housing about two-thirds of its capacity, which is 150 dogs and 150 cats -- is not like any animal shelter you've ever seen. The facility, located in a warehouse district off the Boulevard exit from Interstate 95, is among the largest nationwide. But size isn't everything: The center was designed to defy preconceptions, the theory being that a cheery environment will foster a higher rate of adoption.  That's critical, since the motive for this $7.2 million shelter was the Richmond SPCA's decision to 'go no-kill.' The group is also committed to making the whole city no-kill by 2008.  'What keeps people from walking in the door of a shelter? It's noisy, it's depressing, it's scary, it's smelly,' says Denise Deisler, the Richmond SPCA's associate executive director. 'This place is bright and friendly.'  The building is a 78-year-old red-brick tobacco warehouse with a verdigris seamed roof. Beyond the lobby are 11 glass-doored 'dog living rooms.' About the size of a small bedroom, each is furnished with a stylish blue metal bench and chairs and a puffy dog bed. A large Labrador-mix named Old Bay sits eagerly at the door of one. On his windowsill is this personal publicity: a can of Old Bay Seasoning and a note, 'I like lots of love and need to take long walks on the beach.'   'They will allow you to go in these rooms and actually sit with the dog, and play with the dog, get to know the dog, walk the dog outside,' says Tony Zimmer, the contractor who oversaw the renovation but kept returning after it was done.  A 'lifelong dog person,' Zimmer says he kept coming back because the people, the place and the pets left him feeling good. 'It's not like looking at dogs in cages. You actually get to know the dog.' A couple weeks ago, he took home a 4-month-old red chow.  The public can also visit dogs in the less flashy kennel rooms. The 22 'kennel runs,' each four feet wide and 14 feet long, are significantly larger than standard shelter cages.  At the opposite end of the shelter are the individual cat 'condos' and three cat 'cotillions' -- large rooms with open drawers, cubbyholes and climbing poles, where as many as 10 cats live and people can visit.  All details are designed to bring out the best in the animals. The floors are soft, waterproof epoxy-finished surfaces and the ceilings are sound-absorbent. The cacophony typical of kennels not only is unpleasant for people but also hurts the animals (dogs can hear frequencies more than 20 kHz higher than humans; cats, more than 45 kHz higher).  'When a dog is in pain from the sound, that elevates the stress level,' says Emerson Hughes, owner of Holiday Barn Pet Resorts and former chairman of the Richmond SPCA board, who oversaw the project.  Although the creature comforts are as much for visitors, Deisler says Mozart really does soothe the savage beast -- or confused puppy. In a study conducted at Queen's University in Belfast, psychologists found that heavy-metal music increased anxiety in dogs and caused barking, while classical music alleviated stress and quieted barking.  The shelter's classical music is digitally altered to put a damper on the ultrahigh and low frequencies. 'If they are too stressed out, that reduces their immune system and that leads to them being sick, and if they are sick we can't adopt them,' says Deisler.  But what an adoring public sees and hears in the adoption area is just a small part of the center. Only about a quarter of the animals are available for adoption at any one time. The rest are being rehabbed.  Behind the scenes, every animal gets a physical and behavioral checkup. Dogs with contagious diseases -- like Raspie, a 4-year-old Sheltie with kennel cough -- are confined to the Physical Rehab Room for treatment. Staff experts work with personality problems in the Behavioral Rehab Room. Even healthy animals get a three-day adjustment period to acclimate to shelter life.  Zephia Scarborough adopted a black-and-white kitten she named Steinway a few weeks ago. Because he had been trapped inside a wall for several days before being rescued, the kitten was traumatized. Before taking Steinway home, she had to wait for him to come out of rehab. 'Ten days later, he was fat and happy and purring,' the Richmond resident says.  Also hidden are the shelter's command centers for its centrally controlled, high-pressure hydro-cleaning system that borrows from car wash technology, and its advanced air-exchange system that sends fresh air throughout the building every six minutes. 'It's good for reducing the spread of disease and the odors in the building, and it has the side benefit of not collecting as much dust and hairballs,' says Deisler.  Near the entrance is the spay-neuter clinic. Each year, 18,000 'companion animals' end up here or in one of the city or county shelters in the greater Richmond area; in the past, half of those animals were euthanized. Now the center spays or neuters every animal when it arrives and offers those services at low cost to the public.  Pet overpopulation is a nationwide problem, of course. Accurate numbers aren't available, but the Humane Society of the United States estimates that 8 million to 10 million dogs and cats enter U.S. shelters each year and that half are euthanized. Locally, the Montgomery County Humane Society shelter, the only one in the county, took in 6,650 dogs and cats in the year that ended in July and euthanized about 2,600. The D.C. Animal Shelter took in 9,284 and euthanized 65 percent of them.  Deisler mentions a statistic. How many dogs and cats would every person in the United States have to own to empty all of the shelters? 'It just blew my mind,' she says. 'Six cats and two dogs.'  On the second floor is a 'humane library,' a large auditorium that seats 300 people for educational programs and benefit events, and a spectacular rubber-padded jogging track and training arena where all dogs are exercised and obedience classes are held.  'Part of making this community no-kill is you've got to provide good educational programs for people to understand how to do it,' says Robin Robertson Starr, executive director of the facility, who expects the center to help 6,000 to 8,000 animals get adopted annually -- twice as many as the old shelter.  At the forefront of a revolution in the pet care industry, the Richmond center is attracting international attention. Since opening, it has received 250 job and volunteer applications. (Besides 150 volunteers, it employs 50 kennel workers and staffers whose annual salaries range from $20,000 to $36,000.) People from other SPCAs nationwide call for tours. Starr has participated in an 'international chat' online and a conference in Atlanta. The Mayor's Alliance for Animals in New York has contacted the Richmond SPCA about how it is working with the city to solve the animal overpopulation problem.  The center's no-kill policy means it does not kill animals due to overpopulation. It takes in only animals that it can physically and behaviorally rehabilitate to an adoptable condition. All animals at the shelter stay there until they are adopted. 'We control admissions so as never to exceed our capacity,' says Starr.  Even private kennels are upgrading facilities in what the American Pet Products and Manufacturing Association calls a $31 billion industry: This month, Olde Towne Pet Resort opened in Springfield. Billing itself as 'The Ultimate Pet Care Facility,' it offers services such as an indoor hydrotherapy pool and an indoor walking track and agility course.  'It's more than just the building, it's the no-kill policy. No-kill is the real trend toward significant change,' says Starr, after whom the center was named, along with patron E. Claiborne Robins Jr. In the first 10 months of this year, 1,200 fewer animals were euthanized by the Richmond SPCA than in the same period the year before.  Some of the interest is in how the Richmond SPCA raised $14.2 million in three years during an economic downturn. Half of that went to build and half to operate; the operating budget, derived from donations, is $2.5 million a year, twice that of the old shelter.  'You work really hard,' says Starr, an attorney who worked full time those three years raising donations -- nearly all of them coming from the Richmond community.  Outside her second-floor office, playing with her own 3-year-old shaggy mutt named Nibblet, one of the four dogs and two cats she has adopted, Starr says people 'care a lot about the humane cause, but people don't care a lot about continuing to throw their money at something that never changes.'  What worked in Richmond, she explains, 'was presenting them with a problem that can be licked, telling them how it can be licked.'  But whenever an animal shelter upgrades beyond concrete floors and clanky cages, Starr says, someone always questions treating animals so well when homeless people are sleeping on the streets.  'I have trouble with that comparison,' she says. 'If we wanted to say that human homelessness is the cause that matters the most, then that could also be said of the money that goes to art museums, or the money that goes to botanical gardens, or the performing arts.  'All of those are valuable things that improve the quality of our lives. So do pets. They enormously improve the quality of our lives.'

- My thoughts and actions may or may not be the result of societal influence. - Interesting that you read 'societal mores are irrelevant to (me)'.  Curious as to where that appears in the text. - Interesting that you read '(I) think that each individual should determine their own responsibilities...'  Curious as to where that appears in the text. - Interesting that you refer to '...a governmental body or a group of individuals.'  Curious as to where that appears in the text.
let me rephrase:  are you stating that societal mores are irrevelant to you and that you think each individual should determine their own responsibilities as opposed to having it dictated to them by a governmental body or group of individuals?
In my opinion, these are questions that a society asks for itself. The universe pre-, during, and post-Human doesn't care. The answers will vary from society to society, as well as from individual to individual. All I ask is that you do not attempt to direct my responsibilities.  I can manage them myself, on my own terms.
you know the more i think about this, the more it just infuriates me.   what's that, asks zee bear.   that some people believe that not everyone has the right to decent housing, food, clothes, and health care.  these are just fundamental rights.  how could you deny someone these things?  could you honestly go up to a woman who is ill and can't work and tell her,it's just tough shit for her?  don't we as a society have a responsibility for each other? now, how that's going to be done can be debated and realistic solutions should  be created.  but to think that those things are wrong to begin with?  i just don't get that.

Hey all.  Julie was admitted to the hospital yesterday.  We went in for a routine check, and the doctor saw something she did not like and sent Julie down for observation.  Come to find out, she was having contractions and did not even notice them.  She is only 26 weeks, so no one wants to see these babies born yet.  They gave Julie some medicine that did not stop the contractions.  They then tried a different, stronger, medicine, and it did not work either.  By 5 o'clock, her very reserved doctor, was visibly concerned about the situation.  Finally, around 7, the contractions slowed. and have, as of an hour ago, stopped.  Julie will be in the hospital through at least tomorrow, depending on how she reacts to being weened off the medication.  After that though, she will be on mandatory bedrest.  So, that means my availability for any of the group stuff (Road to Glory, dinner parties, movies) are highly suspect for the immediate future.  I will let you know what changes.

She is trying to smile. I catch a sob in my throat and gently take her hand. Her breasts have been cut, and maggots are crawling in them.' The woman asks Dianna's name, and says 'Dianna, be strong.'

The bill would allow immunity from liability for companies that make faulty antiterrorism devices or technology, and would make it difficult to sue companies that make smallpox vaccinations if the vaccines cause illness.  In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.  full article from the ny times :   House Approves Domestic Security Bill By DAVID FIRESTONE  ASHINGTON, Nov. 13  The House hurriedly approved a revised domestic security bill tonight to reflect a new agreement with the White House on reducing worker protections, brushing aside Democratic objections that Republican leaders had added several provisions benefiting businesses and Republican interests.  The bill, approved 299 to 121, would reverse an earlier measure and allow American companies that have moved offshore in order to evade taxes to contract with the Homeland Security Department. It would also extend protection against liability suits for airline screening companies and many other businesses that contract with the department, and adds a similar provision protecting the makers of smallpox vaccines.  Most Democrats voted against the bill, with many raising objections to the new provisions and the altering of Civil Service rules.  The House voted 215 to 203 along party lines not to create an independent commission to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks. Several members of both parties in the two chambers said they would try to include the commission in an intelligence spending bill that has still not been passed. But Republican House leaders said the commission needed more planning, drawing complaints from relatives of attack victims that they were trying to hide failures that might have prevented the attacks.  Working to conclude the year's legislative business by week's end, the House also passed a stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating through January. Many members of both parties had hoped the House would pass at least a few of the pending appropriations bills the government uses to keep operating, but House leaders said they would take up the bills once the new Congress convened next year.  As expected, Republican House members elected Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, formerly the majority whip, to the new post of majority leader in the next session.   Democratic House members are scheduled to conduct their leadership elections on Thursday, and are likely to choose Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, now the minority whip, as their leader.  This morning, however, a new candidate for the job emerged, demonstrating the continuing disagreements among Democrats over how to respond to their losses in last week's elections. Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio said she would run for the position to draw votes from members who object to Ms. Pelosi's emphasis on fund-raising.  'We will never raise more money than the Republicans  never,' said Ms. Kaptur, who is known for her opposition to free-trade measures and federal funding for abortions. 'We must elevate the non-money wing of the Democratic Party and create populist symbols to convey our message.'  Ms. Kaptur joins Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee in contesting the Democratic leadership election, for which Ms. Pelosi claims to already have sufficient support to win.  In the Senate, Republicans chose Trent Lott of Mississippi to be the majority leader in the next term, along with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as majority whip and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona in the third-ranking job of leading the Republican Policy Committee. Mr. Lott said after today's election that Republicans would focus on national and economic security, mentioning specifically a prescription drug program for low-income older people and making individual retirement accounts easier to use.  Senate Democrats also held their leadership elections today, unanimously choosing Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota as chairman of the caucus, along with Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland in the No. 2 and No. 3 positions. Mr. Daschle will be minority leader in the next Senate, Mr. Reid will be minority whip.  Senators also voted 58 to 36 not to block their annual pay raise, which would increase their salaries by 3.1 percent to $154,700 to $150,000 next year. Passage of an energy bill was deferred until next year because of continuing partisan disagreements over regulation and conservation.  The Senate began a lengthier process of approving the domestic security bill, which is expected to pass as early as Friday.  Senators showed that they remained closely divided on the bill, deciding 50 to 47 to drop the Democratic version of the bill on a closely watched test vote. The new version of the bill will have enough votes for passage, but many Democrats remain upset that President Bush won virtually his entire plan to cut back on civil service protections for workers, making it easier to fire and transfer them.  Many Democrats in both chambers were furious today when they read the fine print of the new version of the bill and found that Republicans had inserted provisions that had not been discussed in the six months of debate on the antiterrorism department, or that had been cut in the Senate bill.  The new language, for example, allows the administration to reorganize the department after it is created, differing from the Senate Republican version that would require congressional approval of a reorganization. It revises a provision, passed 318 to 110 in July, that prohibited contracts with offshore tax-evading companies, allowing the department to waive the ban in the name of saving American jobs.  The bill would allow immunity from liability for companies that make faulty antiterrorism devices or technology, and would make it difficult to sue companies that make smallpox vaccinations if the vaccines cause illness.  In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.  'I'm really quite surprised they would put in the fine-print provisions we never saw in any other versions, that never even went through committees,' said Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee.'  But Republicans, like Representative William M. Thornberry of Texas, said the additions were minor and paled next to the importance of creating a department to protect the nation's safety.

Tori Amos Scarlet's Walk  (Epic)  Tori Amos is one of America's most polarizing artists, with each album predictably regarded as a love-it-or-hate-it proposition sure to thrill every fan and aggravate every hater. But she's made good and bad records just like anyone else: For proof, listen to her sublime From The Choirgirl Hotel and her horrid covers album Strange Little Girls back to back. Amos' well-documented idiosyncrasies tend to be reflected in teeth-gnashingly twee flights of fancy just as often as they produce bracing catharsis, making her catalog both rewarding and punishing when taken as a whole. Come to think of it, that just about sums up Scarlet's Walk, her epic follow-up to Strange Little Girls. A characteristically oblique concept album about finding the soul of America in its open roads, the disc marks a vast leap beyond its more gimmicky predecessor. From the pretty ballad 'Your Cloud' to the irresistibly poppy single 'A Sorta Fairytale,' Scarlet's Walk moves through some remarkable terrain. But amid all the elegantly sweeping, minor-key arrangements are the usual aggravating moments, most notably at the end of songs like 'Mrs. Jesus' (yeech) and 'Wednesday,' which each close with a breathless solo a cappella vocal for dramatic effect. The result tends to highlight lines that don't serve her well: Try not to groan when Amos stops the music on 'Wednesday' long enough to wheeze, 'Lost in a place called America.' But on Scarlet's Walk, her audacity is just as often admirable, and the album represents a considerable step up for fans and foes alike. Stephen Thompson  not from that album but one of my favorite tori songs She's Your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs you can suck anything but you know you wanna be me put on your makeup boy you're your favourite stranger and we all like to watch So shimmy once and do it again bring your sister if you can't handle it she says you control it then she says you don't control it then she says you're controlling the way she makes you crawl She's your Cocaine your Exodus laughing and she knows what you are so shimmy once and do it again Bring your sister Bring your sister if you can't handle it If you want me to Boy I could lie to you you don't need one of these to let me inside of you and is it true that devils end up like you do something safe for the picture frame and is it true that devils end up like you so tied up you don't know how she came She's your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs she got you liking mine back got me takin it in getting mine back lasting mine evil I'm taking my easel and I'm writing good checks you sign Prince of Darkness try squire of dimness please don't help me with this

man, chris, you are  living the sweet life.  (i'm going to assume that ben was talking about a missed call from chris) me - i just spent 4 days in a luxurious mountain resort hanging with one of my best friends (stef), relaxing in a hot tub, picking up rich boys, playing monopoly pinball (one of those activities is not true - figure out which one!)  - it's been fun.  happy new year!
here here!  sorry that i missed your call yesterday - but it sounds like you had a mondo cool time nonetheless - it is long coming and well deserved!    i had a vision from 'Ferris Bueller' when you described the car you got, and then it drifted into something from Shadowrun.  ok, maybe it's just my overactive imagination   fatigue.  regardless, keep us posted on your adventures... good journey!
Good for you, Chris.  And good journey.
A quick note, kids: Life has a funny way of working out (to paraphrase Alanis), and the irony of it all is a balm to sooth even the deepest hurts. For those of you who don't know, I spent seven long, dark, dismal months looking for a job. For those of you unfortunate enough to have lived through an extended period of unplanned joblessness, you know the drill. Darkness. Dispair. etc., ad nasuem, without end. I finally landed one in October, and was happy to begin the long process of rebuilding my work self-esteem. It's a job, even if it is a contract job. Even if the contract ends 31 December. It's a job. With a paycheck. I am happy.  So it was with the most wonderful sense of irony and wonderment at how Life can sometimes work out that I found myself yesterday driving a candy apple red Camero convertable down the Nimitz Highway toward my hotel on Waikiki Beach on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Honolulu for New Year's Eve. Yes, kids, through no effort of my own, I made a withdrawal from my burgeoning account at the Karma Bank.  And the icing: the per diem rate here is $78 a day.  If someone has a place to post them, I'll send pictures of Pearl Harbor when I go.  Happy New Year to all.   P.S. The wierdest part was going from 20 degrees and 24' of snow in New Hampshire to 78 degrees and sunny in Hawaii in less than 24 hours.

i totally agree with your four agreements, ben.  thanks for sharing your wisdom.

I agree with John's comments re: TTT.  I also had issues.  But as a movie, I daresay Joe Moviegoer gets his motherf*ing money's worth in terms of images.  Fabulous visuals.  A shame the story is veering from Tolkien now not only in terms of tone, but now of plot.  Note that the former issue (different tone) was my only complaint re: FotR.  Though I suspected slippage might kick in somewhere in the second movie.  I still maintain that Tolkien wrote a mythology, a history, and a travelogue, with heroic elements -- *not* an adventure story.  Which is what Jackson appears to have decided to film.  Which begs the question:  is this a book, or a film?  Clearly a film -- and as such, while it is a similar animal, it is truly another species than a book, with its own rules and expectations.  To put people in the seats, you don't film a book -- you pull the film out of the book, even if you have to alter it  to do so.  One can film a book, and do it beautifully -- but you better resign yourself to the art circuit.  We'll be glad to see you, but we ain't gonna give you box office.

For those that have not seen Two Towers yet, read carefully.  Nothing I consider a spoiler, but you may disagree.  As a Tolkien purist, I have several complaints.  As a movie fan, not so many, but, lord help you if you have not read the books or sat next to someone who could explain the finer points that are glossed over.  My biggest complaint is the fact that because they expanded on the Battle of Helm's Deep greatly (1/3 of the movie revolves around it - where it was one chapter out of about 12 in the first half of the book) and that they added the romance between Aragorn and Arwen plus a skirmish between the Rohan and Warg riding Goblins, they really only got through about 2/3 of the book.  Given the amount of fighting left to be shown in Return of the King, you can see that they will cut out several parts of the story.  Because of some of the modifications already seen, it does not appear that Aragorn will take the Path of Dead and bring the naval fleet up to break the siege.  They will also probably not address what becomes of Saruman and what happens to the Shire.  The greatly enhanced roles of Merry and Pippin (with Rohan and Gondor) do not appear to be occuring either.  Who will kill the Witch King?  I also think the tried to hard to set up the sequel.  The emphasis on Gollum's discussion of 'she' in regards to getting the Ring are totally transparent to those who have read the books, but not really sold well if you have not.All said and done, I enjoyed the movie, and intend to see it again (hopefully with Mr. Haley when he is back among the living), but am disappointed with the lack of trueness compared to FotR.  BTW, New Zealand is indeed a beautiful country.  I never would have thought they had the terrain and vistas they do.
Happy winter solstice!
a tad bit more important than the whole trent lott controversy: The department wisheswithout having to establish any evidence of a crimeto record names from organizations' mailing lists and petitions, photograph and videotape protesters, and plant undercover agents inside groups and events, according to its court filings. Among the requirements police want wiped from the Handschu agreement: routine oversight; paper records of surveillance; internal reviews of investigations; and publicly available summaries of basic information, such as the number of new probes opened in a year.     urlLink http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0251/lee.php
Having grown up in Mississippi, I can say with some certainty that I agree with my future husband about his assessment of Lott.  He is intelligent and charismatic -- and ignorant as Mississippi Mud.  And I believe he, like many whites (and blacks, for that matter) from the Deep South, have latent issues with racism.  But I also agree that it's a social, not political issue.  Mississippi & Alabama really are almost different worlds from what goes on closer to the Mason-Dixon.  I had never seen such unconscious segregation until I moved there.  I am very happy to be further north now.  Remember also, Chris...that while Lott was attempting (poor thing) to cover his ass on BET (once again, having grown up in MS...BAAAAAHAAAAA!  you have no idea how funny THAT was for me)....he was asked why he voted against making MLK day a national holiday...and he responded by saying (this was voted on in 1983 or so, mind you) something to the effect of having not realized MLK's social-political-historical significance at the time.  What a jackass.  As for his future in the Senate, I don't really shive a git.  I don't live in MS anymore and am no longer directly affected by his decisions.  If government is what it was built to be, i. e. an accurate representation of its constituents, then Lott is a perfect representative for Mississippi and its beliefs.  So there ya go. I'm done.
chris, i compared strom thurmond to adolf hitler, not trent lott. actually, i wasn't really comparing hitler to anyone in particular; i was showing an example of how a person can say something that is not overtly racist but could easily be perceived that way.    i agree for the most part with everything that jls said.  this controversy about trent lott really is just a form of misdirection:  so we aren't discussing real problems and coming up with solid and practical solutions.    and like i said in my post, i knew it was an extreme example - it was mostly for fun.
It seems to me that neither Republicans nor Democrats ever really discuss what I would call politics.  For the record, I do not define the Lott issue as politics.  It's more like idle parlor talk.  Ideological masturbation.  I see no social or economic problem to solve by applying governmental political theory.  To me, it means nothing politically.  Emotionally, sure -- I can see it on that level.  Sociologically, certainly -- race is a fine subject for sociological study.  But politics?  I just don't see any point worth making on either ideological side.  Note that this is only only my opinion.  However, in the interests of idle parlor talk, I will toss this in the ring:  I perceive two kinds of racism.  First, conscious racism.  This is proactive, goal-oriented.  Extreme examples include hunting someone down and killing them, or burning crosses in yards.  It's fairly easy to spot, if only for its focused malignancy.  The second kind is similar in theme, yet very different.  I'll call it, for lack of a better term, unconscious racism.  Here, the person does not seek the destruction or expulsion of the group; he or she just sort of doesn't think about them much.  In fact, there isn't much thought at all.  This describes most of my immediate ancestors.  My grandmother, for example, would talk of 'colored' people in a way that meant no harm, but something in the tone suggested she unconsciously judged them by race.  There was no desire to actively seek out the race and destroy it; she was just -- well -- for lack of a better word -- naive and ignorant.  This does not make it right, but it is an important distinction.  Because in terms of Trent Lott, I have never perceived him as consciously, actively racist.  However, I have followed various biographies of him over the years, and heard him talk, and I have always felt comfortable that he fits well in the second category.  Not that he uses the word 'colored,' perhaps -- but there is a certain...well, naivete and ignorance in his words.  Case in point:  the birthday speech.  It seems to me that the words he chose revealed that mindless (rather than mindful) naivete and ignorance often exhibited by those who really haven't given the matter all that much thought.  This is not to say he is unintelligent, or evil, or good -- it's just an observation of his person.  Note that this is not observation of his *character*, which, for me, would not come into play unless he was in the first category, that of the conscious, ill-willed racist.  It seems to me that this is a man who isn't entirely on the ball about the whole race issue, and revealed his ambiguity (ambivalence?) through a naive and ignorant choice of words at the wrong time.  I do not condone what he said, nor do I praise it.  Ultimately it had absolutely no immediate impact on me.  I just watched the clip and thought 'Huh.  What an unfortunate place to utter such poorly thought-out words.'  All that said, to return to my original point -- it seems to me that so much more could be accomplished in this country if both Republicans and Democrats spent less time yammering on with all this ideological parlor talk and intellectual posturing, and focused all that mental energy on applying the broad range of available political philosophies to the immediate, tangible social, economic, and international issues that we as a society, a government, and a country would do well to confront.  There are real problems all around us.  Let's butt heads in a dialogue that matters, and work towards solutions that piss off all ideological sides just enough to the point that we're as close to the Truth as we can get.  I mean, come on, citizens.  Surely we're smarter than this.
Oh, Mir -- it's nice to see that things haven't changed!  As offended as you might be because Lott stepped up at the birthday party of a man who has lived ONE HUNDRED YEARS and said something vaguely nice about his past, I am 300% MORE offended that you have just compared Trent Lott to Adolf Hitler. There're extreme examples and then there are examples that are so extreme as to make them irrelevant. Exhibit A, your response below.  Once my breathing exercises kicked in, I was able to conjure up a response. Here's a counter-example that is a little closer to home: It's Ben's 60th birthday party. We're all gathered around, munching on fried tofu strips and organic vegetables. I raise my glass to my old friend. 'Ben,' I say, 'you've lived a long and fruitful life. We have all watched with a little envy as you have lived a life imagined and been true to yourself. Now, I was sure that Leslie would turn out to be your one true love, and if you'd snapped her up before she turned legal, your life would have certainly turned out differently. You might even have had enough money to afford to retire by now, instead of mooching off us for so long.' [cue polite laugher from the crowd]   Does this mean that I am advocating a romatic relationship between a 28-year-old adult and a 16-year-old minor? Am I coming out in favor of statutory rape? Hardly. What I am doing is speaking some comforting words to a dear friend of mine, trying to get him to reminisce about days gone by and success won and lost. Now, I am deliberately choosing a less extreme example. Segregation is wrong. Slavery is evil. There is no defending the southern white politicians or the white mobs of the 50s and 60s. But Trent Lott was toasting an old man at his BIRTHDAY PARTY, praising his past efforts, trying to make said old man think back on his life and feel content. Instead of a nice comment on an old man's accomplishments, this has exploded into a racial issue -- and the press has been pumping the bellows and tossing the gasoline cans with reckless abandon for 10 days.  Read the direct quote: '''I want to say this about my state,' Lott said at the party. ''When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years either.''' (Washington Post, 7 Dec 02)  Where in that statement does Lott praise segregation? Where is the racist in the white sheet? Where does he say that the country would be better if we shipped all those dirty negroes back to Africa? Hell, the man didn't even once say 'segregation' -- much less say that the overtly segregationist policies of the Dixiecrat party were right and good and embodied all that made America great. But you wouldn't guess that reading the news stories today....  Now, here's what the press has been reporting for the past two weeks [emphasis added]: 'Senate Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) last night apologized for suggesting that the country would have been better off if  segregationist candidate  Strom Thurmond had been elected president in 1948.' (Washington Post, 10 Dec 02); 'Faced with an uproar over his remark that the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had won the presidency  when he ran on a segregationist ticket  in 1948, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott apologized Monday night, saying he misspoke.' (USA Today, 10 Dec 02); 'Republicans are trying to regroup from the uproar caused by the  segregation statement  by Lott, of Mississippi, at an event marking South Carolina Sen. Thurmond's 100th birthday.' (Reuters, 15 Dec 02); '...Lott said Mississippians were proud to have voted for the  one-time segregationist  when he sought the White House.' (AP, 16 Dec 02); '...when Lott  praised the South Carolina Republican's segregationist run for president  in 1948.' (Boston Globe, 19 Dec 02).   And my personal favorite: 'Gore, speaking on CNN's 'Inside Politics,' said the Senate should censure Lott. 'It is not a small thing for one of the half-dozen most prominent political leaders in America to say that our problems are caused by integration and that we should have had a segregationist candidate,' he said. 'That is divisive, and it is divisive along racial lines.'' (AP, 7 Dec 02)  WHERE DID LOTT SAY THAT INTEGRATION CAUSED OUR PROBLEMS????????  What we have here is not a suddenly outed racist. What we have is a feeding frenzy, started by Democrats still stinging from the thorough trouncing they received in the mid-term elections and facilitated, even egged on, by a decidedly liberal press that has already convicted a man of racism. Yet again, I am disgusted by the blatant leftward leaning of our nation's media....
all right, john - i'll use an extreme example but they are always the most fun :) let's say, for whatever reason, that hitler had immigrated to america, and soon all of his nazi past was pretty much forgotten, he had been elected to the senate by the fine state of south carolina multiple times, and hell, he even had some jews on his staff. okay, it's hitler's 100th birthday.  trett lott gets up and says 'you know adolf, things would have been very different if you would have won world war II, we could have avoided alot of the problems we have now.' now you could assume that trett lott was referring to the autobahn, the volkswagon, the revived german economy, the growth of industry, but you know, no matter how you look at it, you can't get past the idea that one of hitler's main objectives in world war II was to kill all the jews.   some people would find it offensive that trent lott would even conceive that the idea of oppressing/killing a group of people as part of your political platform would be appropriate.   i think that's why people are offended about his comments to strom thurmond.
Ok.  I'll bite.  For the sake of this argument, let's say that Trent Lott DIRECTLY said he was in favor of segregation and all the other race garbage from the South of 50 years ago.  Bottom line, he is entitled to his opinion, politically correct or not.  The last I checked, the First Amendment was still in force.  Why does he have to resign his post?  If the Republicans want him as their leader, that is their choice.  Keep in mind that, according to a black radio show host I saw on TV the other day (Tom Joyner?), 98% of the black vote in this country goes to the Democrats.  Odds are, the voters who would vote based on only the issue of Civil Rights, already voted for the Democrats because of the perception (wrong in my opinion) that the Democrats are more dedicated to that issue.  So, what damage is there to be done by taking the black vote away?  Politically, none.
because of the karl and maggie show exposing trent lott's record, he is resigning from his leadership post. you're welcome, citizen.
ZZZZZZZ!!!!!

Hi & welcome, CK. Congrats to D. Fingers crossed for Julie & J. B, I talked to you already, but I'll say it again: I'm glad you're okay.  This is what I get for not checking the blog since Thanksgiving: BACH's smash-up, Dave's enlistment, John's brood, Chris' arrival.... Thank goodness the ladies are okay. Stay safe, all y'all.  Have been working days making costumes for a dance group at a community center in the South Bronx; Hans Chrstian Andersen's 'Snow Queen' with elementary & middle school kids & some young guest artists from Dance Theatre of Harlem.

And for the record, last weekend I was in Brooklyn, working.
urlLink  Free Speech -- Virtually   Legal Constraints on Web Journals Surprise Many 'Bloggers'   Late last year, John Stanforth posted to his personal Web site a reminiscence about software he had developed for internal use by a former employer. It was a minor project, he said, one he never thought would warrant any secrecy.   So he was bewildered when, about two months later, he received a cease-and-desist letter in an e-mail from his old company. It said that by mentioning the project, he had violated the nondisclosure agreement he signed when he joined the firm in June 1997.   Can we say 'ACLU,' kids?

Props to Mir and Jimi for making appearances at our Holiday Partay of Festivities last weekend. The rest of you get a big fat finger. (Guess which one?)

Oops.  Sorry Ben.  I don't know why you slipped my mind.  Probably related to the shock of Dave's announcement...yeah, that sounds good.  BTW, Julie did come home last night.  Hopefully, she won't end up in the hospital again until the boys are delivered.
that is so sweet that Whiteside has proposed to his girlfriend.  and right around christmas.  and yes, for the love of satan, mr. haley is truly the warren beatty of the group.

Topping our news today, Satan has reported that he is opening an outdoor skating ring in Hell to take advantage of a sudden change in climate (see related story 'Hell Freezes Over').  It appears that the climate change was brought about by a native of Richmond, Virginia getting engaged.  Mr. David Whiteside has proposed to his girlfriend of almost two years.  The date for the nuptuals has not yet been set.  I guess that leaves Jimi as the last dedicated bachelor out there.
my god, it's after midnight on a weekday and i'm still awake and talking to a computer screen.  i should be stumbling around with a half-finished bourbon in my hand.  perhaps wearing a chanel suit and lamenting about how i traded love for success. and success has been nothing more than  a cold, harsh slap in the face.
i love strong bad.
btw, what the hell happened to triebley?
come on everybody!  let's entertain the handicapped boy!
the latest, for all who care:  my car was declared a total loss by the INS company, so i get a payoff to use against the $ i owe on the loan i originally took out to buy it.  it will cover it and then some, but that 'sum' is pretty low.  i expect i will buy another Insight, as it's still the best car on the market as far as i'm concerned, so expect to see 'moondog 2.0' within the next 30 days or so.  i have a lawyer now, and he is taking my case forward.  i should only say so much about all that, but i'll speak up as events warrant.  my recovery is slow but sure, and i still do not know when i'll return to work, or to normal life; i still can't sit for anymore than 15-30 minutes without needing to eventually lie down, but the pain i'm having has decreased somewhat.  which is a real drag, considering how badly i want to see certain movies that are out right now, but they will have to wait.  once again, i thank everyone in the circle for their kindness and patience since last wednesday.  apparently, you find out who your friends are when you have a health emergency as well as when you move!  you've all been very supportive and i will not forget.  feel free to email me at home whenever you like; calls are OK too, but it's generally easier for me to concentrate on the written rather than the spoken, per my fatigue and pain.  plus, since i'm sleeping at odd times, you may inadvertently awaken me in the daylight hours; typically i turn my ringer off when i go to sleep, but these days i need to leave it on during the day to get calls from my doctor(s), lawyer and INS folk which tend to be timely and must be taken ASAP.  well, enough of me.  somebody talk about politics or something.
Damn!  Has it really been three weeks since I last posted?  As the RTG people know, Julie was readmitted to the hospital a couple of weeks ago.  Her test results last week were positive, which, in this case is a bad thing.  The latest ray of hope is that the doctor will re-run the test tomorrow to rule out a false positive.  If it comes back negative, Julie will probably come home.  If it comes back positive, she still might, but her OB and the twin specialist will have to come to an agreement.  At this point, she is 30 weeks, and the doctors ideally want her to 'hold out' (like any of this is up to her) until 34 weeks.  In the meantime I am still doing my juggling act balancing work, the house, my daughter, and visiting Julie. Is sleep necessary?  Everyone please think NEGATIVE!  And then to top it off, I managed to arrange for a sitter for Katherine on Sunday (RTG), and Ben has the audacity of stopping at a stop sign / red light in front of a drunk driver, contributing to the cancellation of the session.  Way to go dude!  All kidding aside, I'm glad you're OK, and that the Honda lived up to its safety reputation
Granted, it's unlikely that CIA missiles will begin raining down on Berkeley or other liberal burgs anytime soon. Killing Muslims, even those with U.S. citizenship, is one thing; offing 'ordinary' Americans is another. As has been the case with previous Bushie infringements on fundamental civil rights--electronic eavesdropping, jailing people without trial or a visit by a lawyer--most citizens believe themselves safe simply by virtue of their not being terrorists.

wtf...   see karl - this is what we should have been talking about last night instead of this silly trent lott thing. The efforts would thrust the administration into a debate that until now has lingered on the fringes of economic policy: Are too few wealthy Americans paying too much in taxes for too many, and should the working poor and middle class be shouldering more of the tax burden?   New Tax Plan May Bring Shift In Burden  Poor Could Pay A Bigger Share     By Jonathan Weisman Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, December 16, 2002; Page A03    As the Bush administration draws up plans to simplify the tax system, it is also refining arguments for why it may be necessary to shift more of the tax load onto lower-income workers.  Economists at the Treasury Department are drafting new ways to calculate the distribution of tax burdens among different income classes, which are expected to highlight what administration officials see as a rising tax burden on the rich and a declining burden on the poor. The White House Council of Economic Advisers is also preparing a report detailing the concentration of the tax burden on the affluent and highlighting problems with the way tax burdens are calculated for the poor.  The efforts would thrust the administration into a debate that until now has lingered on the fringes of economic policy: Are too few wealthy Americans paying too much in taxes for too many, and should the working poor and middle class be shouldering more of the tax burden?  'The increasing reliance on taxing higher-income households and targeted social preferences at lower incomes stands in the way of moving to a simpler, flatter tax system,' R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, warned at a tax forum at the American Enterprise Institute on Tuesday.  The Council of Economic Advisers' 'Economic Report to the President,' scheduled for release late next month or in early February, is to include a section arguing for new methods to calculate the distribution of tax burdens on various income groups.   The Treasury Department is working up more sophisticated distribution tables that are expected to make the poor appear to be paying less in taxes and the rich to be paying more.  Answering critics who say the working poor do face high taxes because they pay high Social Security payroll taxes, outgoing White House economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey told the AEI tax forum that the 12.4 percent Social Security levy should not be considered when tax burdens are calculated. Lindsey said the Social Security tax is ultimately returned to the taxpayer as a benefit.   Lindsey compared the Social Security tax to a deposit in a neighborhood bank's Christmas Club. In such clubs, periodic deposits are returned in a lump sum during the holiday season, and Lindsey said no one would consider such deposits a tax.  Early this month, J.T. Young, the deputy assistant treasury secretary for legislative affairs, lamented in a Washington Times opinion article: '[Higher] earners cannot produce the level of revenues needed to sustain the liberals' increasingly costly spending programs over the long-term. . . . If federal government spending is not controlled, then the tax burden will have to begin extending backward down the income ladder.'  The tenor of the administration's policy discussions marks a dramatic shift from early in 2001, when Bush sold his 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut as a tool to 'take down the tollgate on the road to the middle class,' emphasizing its beneficial impact on workers 'on the outskirts of poverty.' At that time, the administration fretted over the tax burden on the working poor, which the White House calculated to include federal income taxes, state taxes and the Social Security tax.  When administration officials pushed the need to create private investment accounts to supplement Social Security, they specifically warned that taxes paid into Social Security would not necessarily be returned unless the system was reformed.  William W. Beach, an economist at the Heritage Foundation think tank, said he was sympathetic to Lindsey's argument that the Social Security tax is not really a tax. But, he said, it was a dangerous argument for a Republican to make.  'Do I allow defense spending to offset my income taxes since I like to be defended? Do I allow road taxes to offset my profits taxes because I use the roads?' he asked. 'If you do start down that road, it's hard to see anything as taxes.'  But for the purposes of a tax reform debate, removing Social Security taxes from consideration could have a sizable impact. The top 5 percent of the nation's taxpayers paid 41 percent of all federal taxes, a hefty share, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But that same group paid from 56 to 59 percent of all income taxes, an even more impressive burden.  'If we take out Social Security, the poor will look very lightly taxed,' said Robert S. McIntyre, of Citizens for Tax Justice, a tax research group backed by organized labor.  Democrats say the shift could prove ominous for lower-income Americans. And they appear eager for the fight.  'These people are setting the tone in saying the poor really are not being taxed enough and that the burden is too high on the rich,' said New York Rep. Charles B. Rangel, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. 'We're going back some 70 years.'  Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Calif.), a member of the committee, said: 'I don't think there's any question you have a number of extremists in the Republican ranks that would like to see the wealthy do very well. They're going to try to make the case that the average American is overtaxed and subsidizing the poor.'  But to some conservatives, the shift is long overdue. Rep. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has argued for two years that the nation is entering a dangerous period in which the burden of financing government is falling on too few people. In such an environment, the masses will always vote for politicians promising ever-more-generous social programs, knowing they will not have to pay for such programs, DeMint warned.  'This issue is coming to a head,' DeMint said earlier this month, just minutes after making his pitch to outgoing Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. 'You can't maintain a democracy if the people who are voting don't care what their government costs.'  DeMint and his allies have called for a national sales tax to replace the income tax. For those below the federal poverty line, sales taxes paid would be refunded, but under the system, at least they will have seen the cost of government, he said. The working poor would accept a higher tax burden because they would be relieved of the need to file a tax return.  DeMint called his ideas 'the duck's feet under the water,' propelling his proposals forward invisibly. Conservative thinkers at the Heritage Foundation and other think tanks have begun expressing similar opinions. Last month, the Wall Street Journal editorial page made waves with an article titled, 'The Non-Taxpaying Class.'  'Workers who pay little or no taxes can hardly be expected to care about tax relief for everybody else,' the editorial stated. 'They are also that much more detached from recognizing the costs of government.'  But advocates of this new line can expect a furious backlash. Liberal commentators have already reduced the argument to an appeal to tax the poor, and even conservatives worry that the label will stick.  'It's hard to conclude it's anything else,' said the Heritage Foundation's Beach.  Michael J. Graetz, a Yale University law professor and tax reform expert, said he could not figure out where the administration's arguments are supposed to lead.  'I would be very surprised if the agenda is to put more people on the tax rolls,' he said. 'That doesn't seem like a good political agenda.'  But Democrats say that is exactly where the administration is heading. Matsui said he sees the seeds of a disastrous Republican overreach.  'The president is making the case that people who earn between $50 [thousand] and $75,000 a year should be paying a third more taxes,' Matsui said. 'I'd love to debate him on that.'  But McIntyre worried that in the marketplace of ideas, the new argument could carry the day.  'I would hope the public would find it repugnant,' he said, 'but I suppose you never know.'
woola woola woola
i don't know chris.  ben said you had personal experience with that type of two way.  he also said you were obsessed with wa wa.
Mir -- I AM familiar with THAT kind of two-way (and no, not from personal experience, thank you!). That's not going to be a 'two-way' that she can wear.....  The other line from this song that I really like is: 'She likes the Godsmack, and I like Agent Orange, Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad'  What an apt description of much of what passes for modern rock these days. Don't get me wrong -- I love aggressive music. It certainly has it's place. But the likes of Disturbed and System of a Down belong on the underground scene -- not on mainstream radio!! There is nothing that can turn a bar full of drunks ugly faster than spinning one of those songs at about 1:00am (and THIS I know from personal experience!)....
I love you, Johnathan.

It's a new body, so it's ok that he looks so different now.  Riker, on the other hand, needs to lay off the cheeseburgers.  Meanwhile, Deanna seems to be taking beauty tips from Christine Aguilera.

Greetings from the West Coast -- wanted everyone to know that I woke our little Benjamin up to make sure he was OK. I found him groggy and cute when he's sleepy -- not to mention sore and not a little grouchy. Been in LA for the past 2 weeks, training 600 security screeners. The Admiral who's the Federal Security Director here has gone on record saying he wants a total of 1100 trained by the end of the year, so doing the math, that means that there's another, um, carry the one, er, 500 screeners to cycle through in the next 2 weeks. Wheeeee!  Thought I'd write a bit about my day off for Benji's bene -- I was able to pull off one of my favorite things today: the Movie Theater Hat Trick!! Paid money for 'Drumline,' used my free pass (see details below) to get into 'Die Another Day,' then walked across the hall into 'Nemesis' -- an altogether entertaining way to blow an entire day!! My butt's asleep and my eyes are still adjusting to the light, but it was good to get a movie fix.  So it started at 11:00 this morning with 'Drumline.' The movie was 30 minutes late starting because the moved the theater but forgot to tell the projectionist. Oops. The entire audience was up in arms, to say the least (they didn't even turn off the flood lights in the theater until 10 minutes after the showtime) and the manager avoided a riot only by offering refunds or free passes to the entire crowd. Serendipitously, the 30 minute delay worked perfectly, as the Bond film was starting at 1:30. Once done there, 'Nemesis' was only 10 minutes from kickoff, so it was an easy jaunt across the hall!  Opinions  Drumline:  A marching band geek's wet dream. Nearly half an hour of drumline battles, marching band formations, and get-down moves. It would have been very comical if the Lee-Davis marching Confederates tried to do what these bands were hammering out, but it was fun to fantasize about belonging to a band like that. They nailed the internal band politics, too. Definitely worth matinee price, or video viewing at JS' with his monster sound system. A must see if you salivate at the sound of a drumline cadence.  Die Another Day:  I can't say enough how much I enjoy Pierce B.'s James. He manages to make him human, and gives him an edge that Connery had in the early films but Moore could never find. I truly believe that his JB is a cold-blooded killer. Halle Berry, however, never quite convinced me that she was cut from the same cloth. Not that I'm complaining, but she swishes when she moves and it prevents me from believing that she's a hard-edged operative. And Rosamund Pike makes me feel all funny inside and (heh, heheh) my pants got tight when she was on the screen....  Nemesis:  Solid, but not filling. Action-packed, but not 'Khan.' I think my lack of enthusasim is a result of a good thing -- that is, I've seen all the battle scenes on TV -- they aren't breaking ground in that department. Good, since I can get my ship-to-ship action fix on TV, but bad because it leaves me wishing I would be blown away on the big screen. Great villan for this one, but I HATED the whole Data thing. If the next one is 'Search for Data,' I quit (and you know they set that up, too)! I just can't help but think that Berman has wrung the franchise dry. Anybody keeping up with 'Enterprise,' please contradict me and convince me that I'm wrong.  That's all from the Left coast. Hope everyone has a Peaceful holiday!
Eight o'clock Monday night, and I'm waitin' to finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring she wears a two-way, but I'm not quite sure what that means.  Anybody got an idea what the said 'two-way' refers to?
had a great time at the dinner party!  thanks to all who came!   we missed you ben!  and allen hates me now because i made a comment about him being a sexual slave in front of his mother.  damn, i can't tell you how many times i've done that to people.

She came in through the bathroom window  Protected by a silver spoon  But now she sucks her thumb and wanders  By the banks of her own lagoon  Didn't anybody tell her?  Didn't anybody see?

And so I quit the police department  And got myself a steady job  And though she tried her best to help me  She could steal but she could not rob   Didn't anybody tell her?  Didn't anybody see?  Sunday's on the phone to Monday,  Tuesday's on the phone to me  Oh yeah.
and how is this different than what you normally do around your house? (just kidding)
gosh, mir.  what a shame i didn't die - sounds like things would have turned out pretty interesting for you!  of course, you  could  do all those things anyway, if you wanted, even without anybody dying.  for that matter, i don't think the chick who hit me would need to be kung-fooed - if you decided to do away with her, you could just buy a gun.  i'm confident, though, that our justice system will mete out the appropriate penalties - though i appreciate your compliment to me via vendetta.  the world would certainly be more interesting with potential superheroines like yourself!  but i digress.  i live another day!  i'm having to lie on the sofa at this point while i type.  the doc was right - it hurts worse today (it being my body, not the sofa).  ideally, the pain will subside in a few days, and i can rejoin the world of the quick and the foolish at that point, though on a gradual basis.  as JLS has pointed out many times before, in so many ways, it all comes down to medical benefits.  everyone feel free to post amusements here or email them to my home addy to occupy my time as i shuffle about my apartment, bitching and moaning.
my feet smell like buttered popcorn.
on angie's site, i think my favorite pic of her is the first one.  her expression just seems to say, 'what the fuck you want now, man?'
yeah, if you would have died, i would have had to avenge your death - studying martial arts for years under various masters in asia, learning transcendental meditation, fighting the forces of evil from within and without, mastering various weapons, and then finally coming back with my tone body in a skin tight suit and seeking revenge.   well, damn, that sounds a lot more interesting than my life now.   sigh.
greetings fellow iconoclasts.  i live!  a drunk driver rear ended me wednesday night, totaling my wonderful little moondog, and leaving me with a 2-3 inch gash on the top of my head, busted up shins and an overall profound ache.  i bled for over an hour  head wounds are like that, apparently, and difficult to seal  until they closed the wound with 10 little staples.  currently, my hair is matted down with dried blood, since i cant wash my head until tomorrow  gross, huh?  ill be on bed rest for about a week, and then well see how im doing from there.  scary stuff, let me tell you.  it felt like a train had hit my car  the impact was terrifying .  i felt like a bug, squashed beneath the heel of God.  gah.  now comes the paperwork, and the doctors, lawyers and insurance folk.  hopefully my car will be written off as a loss, allowing me to get another one; safe to say that if this comes to pass, it will be another insight.  not sure how long ill be down and out  hoping to feel well enough for road to glory, but ive just got to see how im doing.  i think it's safe to say that i will be unable to attend the winter wonderland dinner, or allen's party afterward - the only way i can currently stay comfortable for any length of time is to lie down - but i hope that the festvities will go on and that everyone has a cool time.  talk to you all soon;thanks for everyones kind words and well wishes.
ben was in a serious car accident last night.  he was hit by a drunk driver - he should be fine but he will be on bed rest for a couple of days.  his car is totaled.  i wish him the best.

'In addition to our conventional and nuclear response and defense capabilities, our overall deterrent posture against WMD threats is reinforced by effective intelligence, surveillance, and interdiction, and domestic law enforcement capabilities,' the statement says.    urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/12/11/bush.weapons.security/index.html

I was born in 1979.
I would have to vote for something by Blondie, Talking Heads (early), or Elvis Costello (early) -- something from the mid- to late-70s, because from 1980/1-onward New Wave changed into something slightly different.  It would be easier to choose an album, like Blondie's Parallel Lines, maybe.  That sounds more pop than, say, Costello's This Year's Model.  But to be honest, the stuff from that time period is really before my time -- I experienced more through childhood osmosis than conscious choice.  If I had to choose something from my own nascent maturity, it would be something from 79-82, after New Wave changed slightly.  From there, I'd choose Gary Numan's 'Cars' or perhaps Berlin's 'The Metro.'  Both of those lean more towards synth pop than Parallel Lines, but it's when I started to become aware of pop music, so it's a sound that has a stronger emotional appeal.
That's nothing! You should have heard him at 5:30 in the morning on the radio....  Ask him about backwards masking the Tiffany song!  Mir -- thank you very much for the invite, but I will have to regretfully decline as I will be in Los Angeles.  Now, Mr. Shipley:  1) Mr. McVeigh ensured a seared national psyche by getting caught -- without the pulpit of the witness stand and the magnification of the media feeding frenzy, we (Mr. and Mrs. Joe Sixpack) would never have known that a small fringe group of dissatisfied citizens feels strongly enough about the state of our nation that they would resort to such a horrific statement. Perhaps now, we can identify with the British a little better. It's always a shock to find out that someone is so dissatisfied with the status quo they react with such a base emotion as violence.  2) Christians everywhere should never, ever forget that the Bible was written by the post-Roman Empire equivalent of the white-guy-of-european-descent. If you ever want a fascinating look at politics, read up on the politics behind the formation of the New Testament. What strikes me about the whole 'in his own image' issue is what the 2000 year struggle between the teachings of Christ (love thy neighbor) and the age-old human nature (do unto your neighbor before he can do unto you) says about the image of God....  3) I disagree with you on this point -- from our comfortably 21st Century agnostic-leaning perspective, it's easy to lump everyone who wasn't a native in the Puritan camp. Religion was much stronger back then, and our Founding Fathers found it as difficult to create the institutions of our government without God's influence as we would have today building an empire sans automoblie -- it's just so pervasive that it affects everything at such a level as to be inseperable. 'But what about the separation of church and state,' you ask? The context there is the religious persecutions and bloodshed of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries brought on by the merging of head of state and head of church (see Henry VIII's creation of the Anglican church for the start of that crap!). The Founders wanted a to ensure (wisely) that religion would not be used as state policy. They could not have envisioned a nation without God. Which is why they are all turning over in their graves at the recent 'Under God' Pledge of Allegiance debacle. 4) Couldn't agree with you more on this one. Preach on, brother! 5) Mmmm-hmmm.  6) Would you consider the citizen of an empire? 7) Seems to me the only sure way to correct the media-induced self conciousness of women is to remake society as a matriarchy. Think that would do it? 8) Uh. Yeah. Words are like cool and stuff. Heh, heheh. 9) Are you offering advice to those designing AI? Seems a basic insight that would make things better for those poor saps. 10) Is that because everything is advertising, or is that because you are a crusty old CYNICAL bastard??? 11) Next to hot fudge sundae, of course.... 12) And I am grateful for your wonderful, meandering, barely relevant insights.   P.S. Need everyone's help: I can't decide between 'What's He Got?' by The Producers and 'Talk To Ya Later' by The Tubes as an example the pinnacle of the New Wave sound. Thoughts?

- I have decided that the Oklahoma City bombing was worthy of shock; September 11 was not.  The anger within disturbs me far more than the anger without. - I feel that the notion of God making Man in His own image is one of the most egotistical and, ultimately, tragic inventions of our species. - I think we misname our Founding Fathers by not going back far enough.  The Puritans are far more evident in our national psyche than the spirit of '76 ever was. - The only thing that will ever unify the humans species is an overwhelming threat from beyond our planet.  In that sense, space exploration and colonization is the only available evolutionary path.

Many artists love to roll about in the deep, rich, oily goo of death and decay like so many bloated, misguided swine.  Their overwrought odes to pain and suffering often seem to me as no more than poorly disguised narcissistic masturbations, and upon reading them I am overcome with a strange combination of numb apathy and weary rage.
not a poem i wrote, but from a publication i am interning for -  urlLink http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/  i am hoping the mighty circle of irony master will link this to our blogger site - anyway, here's the poem - and don't forget, vote for me as despair on january 27th! CORRINNE CLEGG HALES Critical Care  She could be a puppet, blue strings trailing from the backs of her hands, her index finger, her nose, her mouth, even her crotch,   but her wrists are strapped to the metal  bed rails, also her ankles, and white tape  covers her mouth like a burglar's gag   keeping the respirator tube in place.  If she could see herself like this, splayed out  under a thin sheet surrounded   by shower curtains and stainless steel  and everything on wheels, she might laugh. But she is thinking now of learning to swim   in a slow, dirty river, remembering  how her brother dared her to dive  between his legs, and when she did,   how he clenched her head with his knees  and held her there thrashing,  hitting at him through the water   until there were knives in her lungs. It's cold here. She can't speak or feel or move a finger.   She can't even open her eyes. A voice  tells her morphine, a voice says curare.  It says don't worry. It will wear off soon.  This is all so normal for them they strap people down and knock people out  and string people up like this     every day. They do it to save them.  The woman waits. She thinks she has forgotten how to breathe. She hears  someone gasping from a bed  behind the curtainloud, clumsy breaths far apart, the strange deep brand of breathing   that the dying doas if to prove  they can still do it, as if the air itself  might shake them back to life.
(yeah, a little melodramatric and a bit different from the Neil Gaiman character but heck, i think i should be despair)
She wears a diaphanous black gown, her small feet shod in black boots, cautiously padding down the corridor.  She bears a resemblance to her brothers and sisters though her 'gifts' are of a different nature.  She has red hair, eyes that go from blue to green to grey, petite and very pale, normally a somber look on her face.  She has three brothers and two sisters:  she is brooding and philosophical like Dream, understands the purpose and beauty of Death, shares the insanity of Delirium, has coldness and indifference like Desire and Destiny, envies Destruction for his ability to walk away.   When you first meet her, you would think she is her own nemesis.  She understands your grief and pain and you feel compelled to share and have her listen.  And she understands and you feel soothed.  Then she gives back your burdens to you but adds some and she grieves for you and all the others that she cannot help, but is immobile by her nature.   I take on the mantle of the last sibling.  Hello my brothers and sisters,  I am Despair.

The babies are in the NICU, currently being treated for acute repiratory distress because of their immature lungs.  The doctors are very positive in their prognosis, and they should be removed from assisted breathing devices in the next 3-4 days.  After that, once they start eating properly, they will be allowed to come home.  Probably in 2-3 weeks, assuming no other complications.

I must take issue with such a sweeping statement -- I, for one, am not 'culturally set up' to do this.  I have always been satisfied with my own company -- though the right person can certainly enhance the experience.  I recommend planting a garden instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers.
quote from allan gurganus: We're all culturally set up to look for that one other beloved object who will complete us and satisfy us and sate us and make us look good. But while we're looking for that chimera, that unicorn that will never appear, it's damn good to have lots of friends to console you and to support you and literally to carry you down the steps when you can't walk.

Personally, I have nothing against predictable movies.  I know a symphony will have four movements; I know sonata form is often fast-slow-fast; I know many pop songs have two verses, two choruses, and a bridge; I know James Bond will win; I know the meal will end with dessert; I know people in romantic comedies fall in love, despite the obstacles in the way.  Unpredictability is an attribute, not a virtue.
chris, i actually saw the film mbfgw  - and this was before it became 'popular.'  and i was bored out of my mind.  it's full of ethnic stereotypes, undeveloped characters, and  overall a predictable and trite movie - i have no idea why so many people enjoyed it.

'Toe pick!'  I like the Cutting Edge too.  Probably the only Moira Kelly film that I do.  I also like D.B Sweeney, though most people don't.  I am very surprised at your list of movies Johnathan.  From discussing movies with over the past couple of years, my previous post is what I thought I knew of your movie preferences.  Obviously I was just a *little* off in my understanding.  There is only one movie on the list that I have not seen (Purple Rain) and only one I don't care for (The Karate Kid - he makes Luke Skywalker seem like a mature adult).  I guess we have more similar taste than I realized.  My apologies.  Angie - Boys are gross.
I never thought boys were gross.
Some random popcorn movies I consider equal to the Greats:  Die Hard, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars, Jaws, Goldfinger, The Matrix (with reservations), Terminator 2 (the first I consider only borderline popcorn, like Alien or Blade Runner), Aliens, True Lies, Dirty Harry, Ghostbusters, Animal House, Back to the Future, Beverly Hills Cop, Wargames, Trek II, Lethal Weapon.  Some random movies many consider bad or inconsequential, that I shamelessly adore:  The Cutting Edge, Dirty Dancing, Purple Rain, The Karate Kid, Caddyshack, Rocky III, Big Trouble in Little China, Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball Run, Top Gun, St. Elmo's Fire.  Not an art film in the pack, none of them independent, and any one will please me as much as Allen, Fellini, Kurosawa, or Hitchock.
I have not seen the movie, and really had no intention to, but Julie wants to rent it on DVD, so we will rent it at some point.  My reason for not seeing had nothing to do with marketing or what studio produced it.  Since March of 2000, when my daughter was born, our movie watching has dropped dramatically.  Where we used to go to the movies at least every other week, it is know at most one every other month.  From memory, the movies we saw last year were Castaway, Blackhawk Down, SW:II, MIB:II, and Two Towers.  So far this year, we have seen Chicago.  So, that being said, Greek Wedding did not make it onto my extremely short list.  This is not meant to offend or insult anyone, but I find it funny that a film that was aparently not good enough for any of the major studios and became such a mainstream success as an independent film, is disliked by the people who usually like the independent films.  It kind of reminds me of what happened to U2 when most of us were in high school (and Angie still thought boys were gross).  They were liked by a few people (Ben being the one the comes to my mind), and then they got, gasp, popular, and all the people who liked them first suddenly did not want to listen to them.  Johnathan and I have pretty divergent tastes in movies.  Not necessarily in genres, but in what we find enjoyable.  I go to the movie for a couple of hours of escapism, and will usually only have problems with a film because it drags or has gaping plot holes.  From my perspective, Johnathan goes to the movies to see a well produced movie, with a solid plot.  He does not seem to be impressed with eye candy, but more so with the finer details of the film (what kind of lighting, hard vs. soft focus, camera angles, etc).  I, as a fairly mindless member of the general herd, don't notice those things unless they interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.  My general rule is that if the critics love a movie, I don't want to see it.  I have been burned too many times seeing critically aclaimed movies.  As for Jennifer's question about furniture, I have lived in Richmond for 25 years now, and have never heard of the store in question.  Now, it sounds like they make very nice, and assumed to be expensive, furniture.  I don't want to buy something for my house that I will be afraid to use because it might be damaged, especially now with three munchkins cruising around armed with juice and crayons.  So, I will buy stuff from Haynes (at one of their 'best sales ever') accepting that it is not as nice, and almost certainly will not last as long, but then be able to replace it when it wears out, and probably be able to still spend less than a nicer store.
urlLink DON'T PANIC!
All right now, Keeng, I never said that I hated MBFGW. I sneered at commercials because they make the screenwriting for both look unworthy of full production, and thus, wasteful. What's more insulting to the poorstarvingartist than wastefulness? (Answer: not much.) (And I apologise for not giving it a fair shake, but read on...)   I have to agree with your wry observation about successes making failures of art. I am certainly less inclined to see a movie that's gone mainstream, and yes, it is reverse snobbism. That's one of the unfortunate things that I got with my BFA: the belief that artisanally-produced projects appeal to connoisseurs, not the masses. I admit it's skewed (but tell me: How many pieces of furniture have been purchased in Richmond from Ethan Allen or Haynes or (godforbid) Target rather than at Harrison Higgins, who custom-makes beautiful solid goods right on Broad Street at Lombardy?). It's oversimplified & illogical to infer that I won't like a film because it's popularly acclaimed, yet I do it anyway, because experience has taught me that my taste isn't right in step with that of the general viewing public. Yes, I miss things. Yes, I regret the oversights when I discover & correct them. But I'm a stubborn, reactionary little human, and it's the method, although flawed, that's served me best so far.  I know: Judge not lest ye be judged....
You're right -- success does affect my opinion.  I mean...there was a time when I thought Titanic was the greatest American film ever made.  Changed my life.  Then it made all that money, and boy did *that* change my tune!  And how about Gladiator?  My god, what a masterpiece!  Then the success, and the awards...I see a clip from it now and I'm filled with unbridled rage.  What a crazy monkey am I!  Of course, I saw both of these, so my point is undermined....but give me some credit -- the success or failure of any work has no effect on my personal taste.  What I am reacting to is marketing -- and I will be the first to admit that my choices are affected by marketing, usually to the negative, since if I see it everywhere, all the time, and I gotta love it love it love it, as has been and continues to be shoved in my face re: Greek Wedding, I'm going to be really turned off, even if it is f*ing Citizen Kane.  That may be irrational, and it may be unfair, but it's my choice, and I'm happy to blame it on the studio, and too bad for the filmmaker who let it happen, because if an artist puts his or her foot down, it doesn't have to be that way.  I don't like being treated like a six-year-old, which is what the studio has done and continues to do, and it's a shame that what may be a fine little movie bears the brunt of my reaction, but sometimes that's just the breaks in this devil's deal we call art and commerce.  Dance too close to media saturation, and you get burned.  A lesson for artists everywhere.
I sort of boycotted the film mainly because I don't like 'look, it's funny 'cause their culture is different from our culture' movies.  And the ads for the series are...just...awful.  Not to mention that the main actress has a face that just makes me want to punch her.  So no, okay, you're right.  I didn't see it.   Call me close-minded. You're probably right.  But I also never saw half the Corey movies, which were all the rage at the time, and I don't really feel as though I've missed anything. Maybe I'll see it one day, but I doubt it will change my life.  Plus, with my impending nuptuals, I don't want to see a wacky 'everything's going awry' wedding movie.  My own family is mental enough as it is.
Ahem. Just how many of you people that are professing undying hatred for MBFGW actually saw the damn thing? And it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really funny to see how success affects people's opinions. Who are we to be so quick to pull somebody down just because their idea worked? I saw the movie in the arthouse theatre down the street, long before it went wide and 'mainstream' -- and at the time I thought it was clever and well done. I doubt that the movie has deteriorated in quality just because it's popular  And my favorite quote from that horrible rant on SUVs that started this newest thread: 'Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution.'  Consider this startling fact: I can make up any damn fiction I want, and as long as I state that it is explicitly a fact, readers will accept it as so (especially if they are already pre-disposed to agree with said fact), even without any type of documentation to back me up.  It doesn't matter what I say So long as I say it with inflection That makes you feel that I'll convey Some inner truth of vast reflection But I've said nothing so far And I canm keep it up for as long as it takes And it don't matter who you are If I'm doing my job then it's your resolve that breaks
Hi, y'all. Here's my 2 cents (2 words) on the SUV thread: mass transit. Thank the Holy Ghost that I live in a city that has a system that mostly works. (And yes, JLS, the damn things actually are trucks anyway.) BTW, my cousin drives one - but she bought it after she'd had not one but TWO cars totalled around her in collisions caused by SUVs, after one of which her car had to be sawed in half so that she could be extracted safely. Isn't something wrong here? Why do we have to fight evil polluters with their own oversized weapons?  And hey, aren't you mystified about MBFGW turning into a series? I mean, it's cool that they're all working, given today's economy, but isn't that stretching the idea a little thinly? The commercials make it look idiotic. It's a sitcom, I guess, but really. --And you know, I didn't see the movie, either. Didn't need to. Saw half a preview. Now I've seen the sitcom promos. I'm all set. No more doses of Vardalos, parakalos. Pass the feta instead.
It would be nice if from an emissions standpoint, the SUV was classified as a truck instead of a car.  I mean, after all, it really is a truck.  That's really my only beef.
urlLink  Report: SUVs pose danger to cars   Congressional hearing focuses on safety   Wednesday, February 26, 2003 Posted: 1:06 PM EST (1806 GMT)    WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Congress takes its closest look at auto safety on Wednesday since the Firestone tire debacle nearly two years ago, probing the safety of sport utility vehicles.   Regulators, auto makers and consumer groups were scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rollover risks, seat belt use and other safety concerns associated with one of the most popular vehicles ever.   The spotlight will be on the nation's top auto safety regulator, Jeffrey Runge, who last month stunned the industry by criticizing SUV safety. The administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called for meaningful and swift changes.    Concerned about deaths   Runge, an emergency room physician who will be the featured witness at the hearing, is most concerned about rollover deaths and injuries in sport utility vehicles, seat belt use, and the threat posed to smaller cars by bigger and stronger SUVs.   'SUVs inflict more harm on occupants than other cars do,' said Brian O'Neill, president of an insurance industry group that will release new statistics on SUV safety at the hearing.   The group's report, an analysis of government safety data, will show that sport utility fatality rates have fallen sharply in recent years and are now almost even with passenger cars.   But O'Neill said the analysis will also show that because of their size and weight, sport utility vehicles can cause considerable damage to smaller passenger cars in side-impact crashes.    Making their case   The auto industry aggressively defended SUV safety at a news conference on Tuesday, and plans to do the same before Senate lawmakers.   'SUVs are very safe vehicles,' said Sue Cischke, vice president of safety at Ford Motor Co. She said sport utility vehicles are under attack for some of their most noteworthy attributes.   'They do well in front crashes, side crashes and rear crashes,' Cischke said. 'Unfortunately, many people who are killed (especially in rollovers) many times are not wearing safety belts.'    Acknowledging concerns    But the industry has recently acknowledged SUV safety concerns that critics have complained about for years, and federal regulators and Congress have sharpened their focus on them.   The industry's chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, has released data that auto companies agree with government figures showing the fatality rate in rollovers is three times greater for those in SUVs than for those in cars.   Auto makers have also promised to work together to reduce fatalities and injuries resulting from weight and size differences of SUVs and passenger cars. Some longer term improvements could involve design changes in one or both classes of vehicles.   The car companies are trying to head off regulation, which Runge threatened to pursue if the industry did not act voluntarily.   But some critics complain the industry is ceding a little ground now to ease pressure for new regulation and that voluntary design changes could take several years. It can take the government four years or more to approve new regulation.    Some Call For Fast Action   Joan Claybrook, a former director of the federal auto safety agency and now president of consumer group Public Citizen, says Congress should immediately mandate new rules.   'The industry has known for years about these dangers and has bobbed and weaved to avoid regulation,' Claybrook said. 'The government has also dropped the ball.'   Claybrook was also a fierce critic of industry and government action during the Firestone tire saga in which millions of tires were recalled in 2000 and 2001 after tread separations and blowouts were linked to more than 270 deaths. Most of those tires were standard equipment on Ford Explorer SUVs.   Congress passed landmark auto safety legislation after that investigation.
And with the crack of ice breaking on concrete, all her plans and all her schemes collapsed in a single cascade of glittering regret -- only to tumble and pour and pile into an awesome tower of sparkling rage, brilliant and hard and cold under the pitiless winter sun.  It was her day -- it had come at last -- and by sundown, the city would cry for mercy.
You're gonna see your sheba shimmy shake.
I have never seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding -- I just chose to hate it as an act of personal freedom.  Sticking it to the man.  Giving a shout out.  Taking a stand.  Mowing the lawn.  Boogie nights and Herald Square and all that jazz.  Aces.
I'm sure that's nice for some people, but I've about had my fill in life of only realizing something's worth by losing it.  I hate MBFGW as well.  Can I be a soul sister, too?
sometimes the best way to be reminded of something is by its absence.
oh my god, i hated my big fat greek wedding too!  johnathan and i are soul sisters!
In retrospect, I was pretty much describing the average American in that last post, so to include SUVs was irrelevant.  Any opinion I have on the issue is targeted at a kind of person, regardless what they drive.  Ultimately I have no opinion about SUVs, except that I personally don't care to own one.
I just think they look cool. *shuffle*
SUVs....for myself, if I had kids I'd prefer the Honda Odyssey.  If I want a truck, I'll buy a truck.  From what I've experienced of SUVs, the owners have been duped by clever marketing.  There's equal or more room to be found in a station wagon or a minivan -- and better value, to boot.  People who own SUVs are likely to have gushed about My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and probably think it's an adventure to go white water rafting with their coworkers.  I don't care what they drive; but it's generous of them to wear such obvious badges -- makes it easier to see them coming, so I can move to another table at the restaurant.  And hey -- they keep Dockers slacks in business, so...God bless 'em.
john, i'm sorry you're so upset about the loss of the holy ghost.  perhaps you can contact god via prayer and he will rehire him.  just hang in there, man.
so true: After several gentle conversations, I have finally gotten my fianc to share his fantasy with me: He wants to have sex on the top of a bunk bed. He says he likes the idea of a restricted space and our bodies being really close. We don't own a bunk bed, but I really want to make it come true for him. Do you have any ideas or suggestions? Bride To Be  Your fianc wants to have sex in a 'restricted space' with your bodies 'really close.' Where and how were you having sex before his big confession? In the middle of a football field with you in one end zone and him in the other?  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so.  I'm sorry, BTB, but your fianc is NOT into bunk-bed sex. He's lying to you, dumbass. No one with a fantasy life that dull requires 'several gentle conversations' to draw him out! There's nothing the least bit shameful, gross, freaky, or repulsive about sex in a bed, bunk or otherwise. Therefore, there's only one conclusion we can draw from your boyfriend's big confession: He's hiding something.  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so, but he didn't say that, did he? So he clearly has some fantasies he was too ashamed to reveal. Then, when it became clear that you wouldn't stop pestering him until he told you something, he made something up. Something safe. Something innocuous. Something that wouldn't scare you off. Something like, oh, 'I wanna have sex in a bunk bed.' Something that, if it were true, he would have told you during that first gentle conversation.  What your fianc really wants, BTB, is to be peed on or suck the snot out of your nose or blacken your eyes or wear diapers. Or all at once. Or worse. But, hey, have sex in a bunk bed if you think he's telling you the truth. You can order a cheap one from Ikea and fuck on it until it falls apartabout three fucks should do it. But consider yourself warned: He's hiding something big, and you might want to find out what it is before you marry bunk-bed boy.
OH MY GOD!!!  That is the biggest bunch of one sided, tunnel vision, bull crap I have ever read.  He should be a spokesman for Al Gore.  In a few hours, when my blood pressure returns to normal, I might fell like justifying it with a few rebuttals.  That is, if my head has not exploded in the mean time.
From the Onion: God Quietly Phasing Holy Ghost Out Of Trinity HEAVENCalling the Holy Trinity 'overstaffed and over budget,' God announced plans Monday to downsize the group by slowly phasing out the Holy Ghost. 'Given the poor economic climate and the unclear nature of the Holy Ghost's duties, I felt this was a sensible and necessary decision,' God said. 'The Holy Ghost will be given fewer and fewer responsibilities until His formal resignation from Trinity duty following Easter services on April 20. Thereafter, the Father and the Son shall be referred to as the Holy Duo.'

urlLink BIG BABIES   SUV Killers Beg For Mercy  PITTSBURGH--For more than a decade, citizens who drive normal-size cars have been bullied, poisoned and murdered by drivers of sport utility vehicles. Now they're being asked to like it.  'Did My Car Join Al Qaeda?' asks Woody Hochswender in The New York Times. 'Where I live, about 100 miles north of New York City, at least half of all the vehicles you see on the road are SUVs or other light trucks. They make a great deal of sense. This is not just because we have plenty of long, steep driveways and miles and miles of dirt roads.'  'According to their enemies,' writes Walter Kirn in Time magazine, 'SUV drivers aren't just road hogs; they're also sociopaths who are overcompensating for deep-seated feelings of inferiority. I resent being psychoanalyzed this way. I'm after traction, not dominance, O.K.?'  The road hog set is up in arms over TV ads that call their souped-up steroidwagons anti-Christian, anti-American and pro-terrorist. SUVs have had their windows smashed in Washington, been spray-painted with anti-war slogans in Massachusetts and set ablaze by the lot full in Pennsylvania. Environmental groups sell SUV 'tickets,' and bumper stickers that read 'As a matter of fact, I do own the road,' encouraging activists to stick them on the gas hogs.  Opponents call SUVs wasteful, polluting and dangerous to other drivers. Because these fuel-inefficient leviathans now comprise a quarter of new car sales, and big models like the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Suburban only get 12 miles per gallon, all of the air-quality improvements made during the `70s and `80s have been erased. 'But a car's miles-per-gallon rating is only one measure of fuel efficiency,' argues Hochswender. 'Miles driven is another. People who drive light trucks quickly learn not to drive around aimlessly.' He's wrong. There's zero evidence that SUV drivers drive fewer miles than other motorists. And even if some have trained themselves to eliminate frivolous miles, then driving a more efficient vehicle those lesser lengths is an opportunity for further improvement. Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution.  Even more irritating to non-SUV drivers is the sense of being pushed around--and off--the roads by 9,000-pound gorillas. No one needs the results of a formal 'crash compatibility' test to tell them that their Toyota Corolla will fair poorly in a close encounter with a Ford Expedition. The fact is you're more than twice as likely to die in a crash with an SUV than with another sedan. 'Four-wheel-drive vehicles allow workers to get to and from their jobs, and parents to transport their children safely to school, sporting events, ballet classes and the rest,' defends Hochswender. But every SUV added to the traffic on the road decreases the likelihood of someone else's kids arriving alive at school or ballet class. It's basic physics, the law of conservation of momentum to be exact. SUV drivers increase their own security at the expense of other drivers.  Ironically, it's even worse than that. SUVs not only endanger the occupants of smaller cars--they kill their own drivers in roll-overs at triple the rate of other vehicles, according to Jeffrey Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  It's unfortunate if an SUV driver kills himself, but the real issue is what he does to others.  Granted, no consumer is innocent. The Gap T-shirt you buy at the mall is produced by children toiling under exploitative conditions overseas. Microsoft software is packaged by prisoner slave labor. Of course, if you were truly virtuous you'd skip even that sexy hybrid Prius and its holier-than-thou 50 m.p.g. rating and just bike to work. But it's hard to argue with Union of Concerned Scientists director Jason Mark's conclusion that, as socially-responsible purchasing decisions go, SUVs 'represent the worst.'  Short of opening a shooting range next door to a daycare center, buying an SUV is perhaps the single most antisocial act an ordinary American can commit. And as resentment against this egocentrism coalesces into anger, SUV owners are becoming defensive. Kirn again: 'Nothing takes the pleasure out of driving like the suspicion that at every four-way stop, someone in a fuel-efficient compact is sneering at my moral deficiencies. I want to scream, `But I live on a dirt road! I have a farm! See all the mud on my fenders! I need this rig!''  What I would scream back, if I met Kirn, would be this: 'What did you people do 20 years ago?' Back in the days before SUVs, farmers drove pick-ups and the rest of us drove cars. The soccer mom with a gaggle of kids drove a low stationwagon or slow minivan. Nowadays, the overwhelming majority of SUVs are plying our highways and suburban streets. Fewer than one percent will ever be driven off-road.  Why are SUV owners surprised that nobody likes them? Americans have long defined themselves by the cars they drive; is it unreasonable to assume that someone who drives an oversized gas guzzler is a selfish, aggressive lout? People buy SUVs because they're imposing, so they can see over smaller cars. Is it shocking that drivers whose sight lines are blocked by these hulking machines, and who are blinded at night by the headlights of great overbearing tailgaters, are resentful?  More and more SUV drivers are coming out of stores to find their vehicles 'keyed,' stickered or worse, and SUVs are replacing fur coats as the spray paint target of choice. Sure it sucks, but can SUV owners complain? Vandalizing property is a mere misdemeanor next to willfully endangering other people's lives and hastening the demise of the planet.  'What are we supposed to do now, turn our SUVs in?' asks Hochswender. Well, yeah. And quit whining because everybody hates you.   urlLink - Ted Rall
Thanks to sickness, which teaches us all!  Wait....
Thanks to The Powers That Be for sending me Johnathan to take care of me when I'm horribly sick.
Thanks to Mir for getting horribly sick so she could realize my greatness.
i was feeling really crummy and then i thought - my life is starting to play out like a pretty good woody allen movie.  and suddenly, my life seemed better. thanks to johnathan for introducing me to the world of mr. allen.
Equally good advice:  Friday night and the lights are low  Looking out for a place to go  Where they play the right music, getting in the swing  You come in to look for a King  Anybody could be that guy  Night is young and the music's high  With a bit of rock music, everything is fine  You're in the mood for a dance  And when you get the chance  You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  See that girl, watch that scene, diggin the Dancing Queen   You're a teaser, you turn 'em on  Leave them burning and then you're gone  Looking out for another, anyone will do  You're in the mood for a dance  And when you get the chance  You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  See that girl, watch that scene, diggin the Dancing Queen
indulge me for a moment - 'happiness is a prison, evey.  happiness is the most insidious prison of all.'  'that's warped!  that's warped and evil and wrong!  when you threw me out i went to live with somebody. i...i was in love with him..i was happy.  if that's a prison then i don't care!'  'don't you?  your lover lived in that penitentiary that we are all born into, and was forced to rake the dregs of that world for his living.  he knew affection and tenderness but only briefly.  eventually one of the other inmates stabbed him with a cutlass and he drowned upon his own blood.  is that it, evey?  is that the happiness worth more than freedom? it's not an uncommon story, evey.  many convicts meet with miserable ends.'  from my favorite novel - 'v for vendetta'
good advice from a good friend -   this night is yours  and every other - it is a good thing to  unlock cages.  it is a better thing  to leave them behind, in whatever form they take.
i think we can all agree that angie is a wonderful human being and that we all wish her well.   good journey, my friend.
I will keep Angie in my prayers. I hope that the new strategies will prove helpfull. I will never know the physical pain she goes through but know that at least emotionally Angie's and your pain is shared.   Peace and long life my friends!
The only arrogance I personally see in Bush II is his language which places him and America as the representatives of Good, capital G, and our enemies as representatives of Evil, capital E.  This kind of language scares and enrages me, regardless of the speaker.  Any other disagreement I have with Bush II et. al. is a matter of philosophy or economics.  As to acts of will:  I'm not sure that limiting another's options to agreeing or stepping aside is necessarily an accurate definition of non-arrogance.  Consider the State planning a freeway or landfill near one's neighborhood; it tells the residents to agree or step aside, and not to stand in the way -- after all, look at all the State does for its citizens!  Wouldn't the residents percieve such a policy as arrogant?  It seems to me that expecting (or demanding) no one to stand in one's way smacks of a kind of arrogance.  Also, I'm not convinced that acts of goodwill are points to be cashed in later when one wishes to act with abandon.  I may be wrong; perhaps in terms of history and foreign policy, they are.  Did we really defeat the Soviet Union, or did the Soviet Union fall victim to its own geography and internal corruption?  P.S.  Keep Angie in your thoughts -- the recent flareup of her fibromyalgia continues to cause great pain and sadness.  Today's visit to the rheumatologist revealed some new strategies, but no new information.  She's truly my hero -- anyone else in her conditions (and they are plural) would have given in to depression, cynicism, and bitterness long ago.  That she smiles and sings and laughs and dreams is a tribute to the depth of her courage and the size of her heart, and I'm not saying that just because I love her.  If more people could shine a light like hers, the world would be a far better place.  May we all learn that the secret to happiness is perspective, gratitude, and the love of a beautiful person.
Good luck to Chirs on the interview. If you interview as well as you debate then you will do very well.  As to debates..... intresting one we seem to be having here. Right now I only have one question. Does any one have a extra lung? I seem to hacked mine up this morning. Bleh! [hack, cough, cough]  [crawls back to the corner]
Unless he has been keeping a big secret or been spreading misinformation, no.  The pregnancy he has talked about in the past is his sister in-law.
now, is chris's wife preggers?
Wow, a debate with more than me and Mr. Wigglepants involved.  First, the easy ones  Miriam - rest, drink fluids, and don't read Salon (Oh, sorry, that would make  me  feel better) Chris - Good luck with the interview.  Let us know how it went.  Also, congrats on the birth of your niece.  Ok, here is a very simplistic solution.  Develop real, practical, cheap, alternative energy sources.  Face it, why did we originally get involved in the Middle East?  To protect our oil interests from the Soviets.  Now we are there and can't or won't back out and let the people solve there own problems, in part, because we are dependent on the bubbling crude.  If you develop a hydrogen car (very easy in theory, tough in execution because of no infrastructure to deliver the H2), our oild demands would drop.  I would think that you could also use that technology to heat homes (reducing the need for fuel oil).  It would probably lower our nationwide demand for oil to the point that we could provide our own national requirements, or get it from non-OPEC countries.  Imagine what that would do for air quality.  If that happens, why would we stay in areas that we are not wanted and that don't serve our national interests.  That would allow us to pull out of Saudi Arabia, supposedly making the Islamic extremists happy (I'll believe that when I see it), since we would no longer be on Holy ground.  BTW, the last I knew, Prince Sultan airbase is out in the middle of the desert, not surrounding Mecca or Medina, but hey, what do I know, I'm just a Christian infidel.  Now, to reality.  Johnathan, in this case, I don't think we can negotiate on one side and use military force on the other.  Concerning Israel, we have limited military presence in Israel, probably just in the form of observers and exchange officers.  We (the US) became a target because of our support for Israel.  The option of abandoning Isreal and letting things go as the two sides want, would, to me, give the message that we will let the Arabs finish the job Hitler started.  I know that is not what you are proposing, but that is how *I* see a change in our stance playing out.  As for giving the Palestinians there own country, that sounds good in theory.  But, will Arafat or whoever is the leader use all his resources to prevent Palestine from becoming the launching point and safe haven for organizations like Hamaas and Islamic Jihad in their effort to destroy Israel?  His track record is not great so far, thus Isreal's stance on the issue, and I don't see where we can tell Isreal that they have to give up territory to an enemy that is sworn to destroy them.  Concerning Saudi Arabia, at this point, we don't have any choice but to have troops there.  Prince Sultan is an established base that is currently critical to the implending conflict.  The ironic thing is that the base was closed and our troops were removed after the Gulf War.  Then, circa 1995, the base was reopened.  You know why?  Because Iraq was proving to be less than compliant with UN requirements.  So, if Iraq becomes democratic, or, as tangentially suggested by my esteemed colleague from the great region of NOVA, the 51st state, we won't need to have troops on what is considered by some to be holy ground.  Either because they won't be needed at all or because they will be able to operate from Iraq.  In summary, I don't think we can negotiate and retaliate in this case.  Imperialist America.  I am pretty much a Hawk, but that idea does not sit well with me.  If we ever are going to have a world wide government, it must be done through peaceful means if it is to last.  Military conquest will not work, because enough people will feel oppressed to overthrow the imperialist aggressors.  Lovely Angie, you mean that there is more to America the Mickey D's and Swoosh shoes?  Man, I have been living in cave.  Seriously though, could you or Chris explain the basis of the 'arrogant conservative President' comment.  There are lots of adjectives I would agree with when describing President Bush, but arrogant is not one of them.  He expects our allies to either support us (Britain and many other European countries) or get out of the way (Canada), but definitely not stand in the wat (France-Germany).  Given all that the US has done for the world and Europe specifically in the last century (led the Allies in defeating Hitler, defeated the Soviet Union without firing a shot), I think we are entitled to at least expect the main benefactors of the US to not get in our way.  I don't care if they choose to not get involved for internal political or other reasons.  Just step aside.  I don't see that as arrogant.  Chris, there are many people around the world and quite a few in the US who don't believe that capitalism will help the raise the qulity of life in the world.  Many people still dream of socialist or communist states.  Enough rambling for now.  Lunch was supposed to be over half an hour ago.
Disclaimer:  The ideological phallus of which I spoke, or rather the waving of such, refers primarily to government officials of all stripes and the numerous pundits and talking heads who appear in the various media.  My present interlocutor, much to his credit and to my satisfaction, throughout my history of knowing him (including in the present argument), has mostly kept his ideological willie safely tucked away in his pants.
Good luck on your interview.  I only hope that all these strategies, while relevant to rational opponents, transfer smoothly when applied to irrational opponents.  I'm not entirely convinced that the policymakers in control right now fully understand how different it is when your opponent perceives him- or herself as the servant of God.  Kind of ironic, when one considers how much a certain party insists on using language that suggests that they, and the country, are...the servant of God.  I feel both sides, for or against, are presenting only partially convincing arguments.  Both sound good to a point, but then they drop off into the la-la land of kneejerk idealistic political party lockstepping -- I follow along for a while, nodding in agreement, until it suddenly seems to me as if out of nowhere the proponent whips out his or her ideological dick and starts waving it around.  I must say, though, that I'm glad we're sending *billions* to Turkey so they'll let us put a base there.  I'd hate to think we could have wasted some of that money on collapsing school buildings, kids without health insurance, or parents unable to tend to their mentally ill children.  For now, I'll continue to reluctantly support the 'war,' such as it is; I'll reserve more comprehensive judgment until more time has passed.
Unfortunately, Madonna, you are correct. It is all we're showing them now. See my earlier comments on my opinion of how this administration has handled foreign policy....  And, yes, harmony, we are going to engage a part of the world with the Screaming Eagles. Sometimes, people will only stop and listen when you hit them over the head with a very big stick.... I have to say that the military has become a very effective instrument of exporting the good parts of America. See Dana Priest's new book: 'The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace With America's Military' for more information (and very engaging reading) about how the US military has successfully stepped in and delivered peace and security in places like Kosovo when institutions like the UN have failed utterly.  Can you tell how I've been spending my free time?  Another interview at 1:00 today -- keep your fingers crossed.....
My thought exactly.   How can we show them that we're about more than just McDonalds and Nike sweat shops and arrogant conservative Presidents when, from my perspective, that's all we're really showing them right now?  I'd like to believe that America is so cool for school that we can make the rest of the world like us...and I completely agree that there are a lot of wonderful things about this country that could appeal to many.  But I don't think that's the image we're really showing right now.
Question -- 'We must engage the parts of the world that hate us' -- is that what we're about to do with the 101st Airborne?  Yikes indeed.
Thanks for the dance response -- I understood it better than the previous post.  Curious:  So when will we get around to addressing the reason?  It seems to me we've been leaving the reason for later since 1948.  Which is acceptable, if it has indeed taken these 50+ years to put out the flames (although my amateur eyes don't see the fire getting smaller).  How many years does one fight flames until one can reach the oil flow?  Analogies Amok -- Am I correct in rephrasing that violent terrorists of any kind flourish because there is very little oxygen (economic growth) in the room, and the terrorists supply a half-opened window; and that in this room, everyone else (the mass population) can't breathe clearly, and thus can't think clearly; and that our intent is to force oxygen into the room, thus allowing everyone (the mass population) to breathe easier, which will allow them to gather their wits, and be happy, thus making the terrorists and their little half-opened window irrelevant?
And, and.... Mir -- I hope you are feeling better soon. Drink OJ and sleep -- 's the only way to beat the damned flu.  P.S. Whether we are comfortable with it or not, we are the most powerful country the world has ever seen. Do we use that power to shut ourselves off from the world, turn inward and merrily go along, fiddly dee, tomorrow is another day? I think that we are 50 years past the time when the oceans could protect our country from the world (see 9/11). Like it or not, we have the opportunity to raise the world's standard of living, to bring hope, elightenment and cash flow to billions who would never know the joys of good dental hygene or low infant mortality rates, or education (which are the flip sides of consumerism and Jerry Springer). We must engage the parts of the world that hate us, and let them see the things that make our country and our system great, so that they can understand that it is not just about McDonalds and Nike sweat shops and arrogant conservative Presidents.   'With great power comes great responsibility.'
urlLink enjoy  or not
And we are addressing (kida) the deed with Iraq, leaving the reason for later -- but if you are fighting a fire in an oil rig, you have to put out the flames before you can shut off the oil flow....
And let's run with the World Dance Party scenario:  Yes, we're at a party, and yes, we're playing some pretty rockin' dance music (the remix of Oingo Boingo's 'Dead Man's Party' sounds pretty good to me right now...), and yes, we'd love for everyone to dance. But, no, we're not turning up the music louder. We're only encouraging everyone to have a good time, like any good host, whether they are dancing or not. And the problem is not that there are people who don't want to dance. It's that the kitchen is full of band geeks, D&D freaks, and goth-wannabes who hyperventilate when girls talk to then and wouldn't know how to dance if John Travolta delivered private lessons. And there's a trumpet player who is stirring up trouble with this anti-social crowd because he doesn't like Oingo Boingo, and our intrepid band of misfits is starting to get surly. So -- do you let the party dissolve into a brawl? No -- you do your damnedest to get everyone involved in the party -- because when people are having fun, they aren't plotting to blow up governement buildings. And you take the trumpet player out into the back yard, beat the snot out of him, and ask him to leave the party. Which only makes him more disaffected, but as there aren't but a few sycophant baritone players and a doe-eyed clarinet chick left for him to whip up, it's OK to let them go sulk at the I-Hop down the street.  That's my take.
'I liked Reaganomics a lot -- it's got a good beat and I can dance to it.'
well mr. wigglepants, since i have no health insurance, it is difficult for me to see a doctor.  i have, however, taken several over the counter medications and pain killers.   i am not currently stoned as i am running very low on leaf and may need it later when the pain gets more intense.    and i liked your dance party analogy.
Johnathan just much more aptly illustrated the point I was trying to make in my most recent post.  Thank you, honey.
Miriam -- have you seen a doctor, or are you hoping one will appear in your drug-induced haze?
Another question, and I'm only trying to understand:  So we're essentially at a party (the world) where not all the people (nations) are dancing (joining our economic vision), so we're turning up the music louder and louder (cramming our economic solution down their throats) until either all people (nations) are dancing (just like us) or they are whimpering in the corner (forgotten [central Africa]) or under our direct command (colonized [Iraq] by our forces)?
i have had the flu since friday night.  i have thrown up, had chills, back aches, horrible headaches, and overall dizziness and fever.   right now, i'm sweating and about ready to throw up my food from last night.   the only thing, honestly i have tried everything else, that has truly helped me is pot.  pain killers can't seem to get rid of the aches and the nausea is still there.  but when i smoke pot, the nausea is gone, my pains are gone, and i can actually eat.  and believe it or not, i feel less dizzy when i'm stoned. and no, it doesn't feel like a normal high at all.  it just makes me feel - more normal - able to function. so does someone wish to explain to me why medicinal marijuana is illegal?  urlLink http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2002/11/05/drugwar/index.html  - just some extra info.
Bear in mind that I am not at all articulate about such things, but I have to say that I don't like the image presented by CK's argument.  I feel as though America, if it takes the approach that CK presents, would become imperialist bullies.  I feel like we're the the snot-nosed brats of the world, stomping and whining about how we want everything to be our way or the highway.  And I fear that the global community will become fed up with our audacious attitudes.  For about ten minutes after 9/11, we were the whole world's sweet wounded child.  Now we're the world's screaming bratty embarrassment.  *shrug*
I'm still not understanding.  Someone please explain to me why addressing the deed and not the reason is safer and more effective than simultaneously addressing the deed and the reason.  Since the former is what I see my country currently doing, I would be delighted to be convinced of the strategy's wisdom.  Thanks in advance.
Ahem. Sorry I'm late for the discussion, but I had to clean up the small flood in my basement first. It might not surprise any of you that I have some thoughts about the upcoming conflict and the issues surrounding it.  Let me apologize in advance, as this is going to be long as crap, but bear with me (I've been thinking a lot about these issues lately -- time is about the only thing my  unemployed ass can afford these days).  First, though, I have but one word for the way the Bush Administration has handled foreign policy since the collapse of the Taliban in Afghanistan:   Amateurish . If you don't like that one, here're some other choices: sloppy, slapdash, clumsy, crude, slipshod, inept, bungling, or incompetent.  The Model UN Conference that I attended in 1992 at Princeton would have produced more elegant diplomacy than that of the leadership of the current administration. I have been continuously amazed and dismayed at the ineptitude with which this administration has conducted foreign policy. Bush II sold his soul (with the tacit approval of the Republican National Committee) to the conservatives in 2000 in order to win South Carolina and staunch the grassroots support that was propelling John McCain to the Republican nomination. Woe to the future of our country as a result, for the very same conservatives that now have a hotline to the Oval Office (or perhaps more importantly, to Carl Rove's office) and they are giving our reputation as thorough a drubbing as Clinton did back in 92-93. The ham-handed and despicably snotty attitude with which this administration has approached the rest of the world has directly lead to the worst crisis in NATO history and an intransigent and increasingly hostile UN. I was relieved to see that I wasn't the only one of this opinion last Sunday -- read this article:  Forceful Tactics Catch Up With U.S.  Turns out that the US is only reaping what it was sown over the past 2 years, starting with our disgraceful behavior re: the Kyoto Accord and going downhill from there. (Some of you might remember my support for our withdrawal from the ABM Treaty -- mind you, I still think that we did the right thing -- just in a terribly wrong fashion....)  So, registering my strong, nay intense, disapproval for the manner in which Mr. Bush II conducts his foreign policy, let me now tell you why going to war is not only right, but in the best interests of the US in the long-run: lubing the wheels of regime change in Iraq means the difference between John and Johnathan's nightmarish and ultimately impossible proposal of utterly annihilating all extremists in order to live peacefully, and influencing the world in such a positive manner that extremists will be relegated to John's desert, where they can do little harm.   But first we must set aside all of the emotional and bleeding heart baggage in order to discuss  realpolitik  in a form Cardinal Richelieu would immediately recognize and approve. So, let's set aside the fact that war is destructive and killing people is wrong -- that's a given. Set aside the wrong-headed argument that this is about oil -- 1) unless you are living in a cabin in the wilderness without electricity and  any  modern convenience, you  must  accept the fact that oil is the lifeblood of our modern society and therefore securing a stable and cheap source incontrovertibly benefits all of us; and 2) If oil was on Bush II's mind, we would invade Venezuela, whose crisis has posed a more serious oil problem for the United States than Iraq ever could. Set aside the fact that this whole thing with Iraq feels like 'You beat up on my dad by defying him, so I'm gonna beat up on you...' -- since the hawks of Bush II's administration were all veterans of Bush I, we can assume that that  certainly  had a lot to do with choosing Iraq as the next target after the Taliban folded like a cheap card table. Johnathan, the reason you noticed the link between terrorism and Iraq has been downplayed is because  there isn't one.  Regardless of all of these issues, there are compelling reasons for us to go to war in the desert again.  So let's talk geopolitics: On the day the war ends (and I'm not taking a big leap by assuming that we win), then the  entire geopolitics of the region will be redefined . Every country bordering Iraq will find not the weak formations of the Iraqi army along their frontiers, but US and British troops. We will be able to reach into any country in the region with covert forces based in Iraq, and we could threaten overt interventions as well. We will not need permission from regional hosts for the use of facilities, so long as either Turkey or Kuwait will permit transshipment into Iraq. In short, a U.S. victory will change the entire balance of power in the region, from a situation in which the US must negotiate its way to war, to a situation where we are free to act as we will.   If we consider the post-Iraq war world, it is no surprise that the regional response ranges from publicly opposed/privately not displeased to absolute opposition. Certainly, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran (and Jordan, to a lesser extent) have nothing to gain from a war that will be shaped entirely by the United States. Kuwait and Turkey are the other countries bordering Iraq, and they are in the US camp already. Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been banking on European resistance to a war to prevent it. It remains to be seen if that can happen -- personally, I think that Bush II will pull the trigger no matter what the UN decides in the end. And the rest of NATO has already come out in support -- magnifying the split within the European Union between the big nations and the small (Germany and France vs. everyone else). And don't even get me started on my opinions about why France is opposing the war.... The European split -- and the real possibility that France and Germany ultimately will endorse war in some way in order to reap the not insubstantial benefits of rebuilding Iraq -- mean that war cannot be prevented. Saddam will not abdicate or be overthrown until the war is well under way. Therefore, it is highly likely that the war will take place, the US will occupy Iraq, and that the map of the Middle East will change profoundly.  The Bush II administration is well-aware that its increased presence in the region will result in greater hostility. However, we should view this rising cost as acceptable so long as Washington is able to redefine the behavior of countries neighboring Iraq. In the long run, though, geopolitical power will improve US security interests in spite of growing threats. To be more precise, Islamic hostility at a certain level as a given, and does not regard an increase in that hostility as materially affecting its interests.  The conquest of Iraq will not be a minor event in history: It will represent the introduction of a new imperial power to the Middle East and a redefinition of regional geopolitics based on that power. The US will move from being an outside power influencing events through coalitions, to a regional power that is able to operate effectively on its own. Most significant, countries like Saudi Arabia and Syria will be living in a new and quite unpleasant world. And, perhaps more importantly, it will offer the opportunity to create a democratic state in the Middle East that actually works. A place where democracy and capitalism are afforded the opportunity to grow and flourish. And this, more than any other reason, is why it's important for us replace Saddam by any means necessary.   Because this gets down to the root of the issue, as JS has urged us to do.  It comes down to this: Where there is globalization and economic opportunity, John and Johnathan's extremists are forced into the proverbial desert. Where there is economic stagnation and political repression, and the extremists not only operate in the open, but they are a powerful force in that society. So, rebuilding Iraq  a la   Germany after WWII is not only good morality, but it is solid strategic vision.  If you have the chance, get your hand on a copy of the 1 March edition of Esquire Magazine. Inside, you will find an article written by Thomas Barnett entitled: 'The Pentagon's New Map. It Explains Why We're Going To War, And Why We'll Keep Going To War.' If you cannot find this article, I have an electronic version I will be glad to email you. It is very important that everyone reads and understands this new paradigm -- remember that the world is an inherently more dangerous place since the end of the Cold War, and this theory goes a long, long way to help us to understand the situation in the world and our place in it. Here are the first couple of paragraphs, which mirror my thoughts exactly:  'Let me tell you why military engagement with Saddam Husseins regime in Baghdad is not only necessary and inevitable, but good.   When the United States finally goes to war again in the Persian Gulf, it will not constitute a settling of old scores, or just an enforced disarmament of illegal weapons, or a distraction in the war on terror. Our next war in the Gulf will mark a historical tipping point the moment when Washington takes real ownership of strategic security in the age of globalization.   That is why the public debate about this war has been so important: It forces Americans to come to terms with I believe is the new security paradigm that shapes this age, namely, Disconnectedness defines danger. Saddam Husseins outlaw regime is dangerously disconnected from the globalizing world, from its rule sets, its norms, and all the ties that bind countries together in mutually assured dependence.   The problem with most discussion of globalization is that too many experts treat it as a binary outcome: Either it is great and sweeping the planet, or it is horrid and failing humanity everywhere. Neither view really works, because globalization as a historical process is simply too big and too complex for such summary judgments. Instead, this  new world must be defined by where globalization has truly taken root and where it has not.    Show me where globalization is thick with network connectivity, financial transactions, liberal media flows, and collective security, and I will show you regions featuring stable governments, rising standards of living, and more deaths by suicide than murder. These parts of the world I call the Functioning Core, or Core. But show me where  globalization is thinning or just plain absent, and I will show you regions plagued by politically repressive regimes, widespread poverty and disease, routine mass murder, and most important the chronic conflicts that incubate the next generation of global terrorists. These parts of the world I call the Non-Integrating Gap, or Gap.'  Let me know if anyone wants to read the rest of this article  its incredibly enlightening.  So  JS and John  it doesnt have to come down to either/or.
Sadly, I think you are right in the solution of wiping all extremists out, but that will not happen, nor should it.  There must be some way to get throught the hatred that prevents them from accepting anything but their total victory.  If OBL wants to sit in the middle of the desert and preach hatred of the Zionists and their lackeys (USA), I have no problem with that until the hatred crosses the line and becomes violent action.  Then, I see it as a simple matter of survival.
Clarification:  I do not define appeasement by addressing an attacker's complaints while simultaneously exacting wholesale and decisive retaliation for that individual's attack, which is the argument I am making.  If, however, there is no way at all to address the attacker's concerns, I argue that there is no option but to wipe out the entire ideology.  Because the ideological warrior cannot be deterred, ever, as long as he or she exists.  I hesitate to use the word 'ideology,' because a counter-argument could be made re: Communism, which one could argue was a deterred ideology -- but I feel any attempt to compare radical Muslim fundamentalism to Communism is foolish, so I'll let it stand.  Waiting out a political, economic, and social movement is far different from waiting out an opponent who is following the words of the one and only Creator of all that exists.  It sounds as if those who support reacting to the deed without addressing the reason, do so because there is, in fact, no way to address the reason.  Since I would rather not see a future in which We and They are locked in violent conflict until the end of our species, it seems to me that within these restrictions, we must wipe out all violent Muslims, everywhere, and strike them from the historical record.  Given these restrictions, that seems to be the only remaining option for a lasting peace for this and future generations.  Please, someone convince me that there is hope to be found in reacting to the deed and not the reason.  The argument and consequences as I understand them reveal to my eyes a future of unending violence, bloodshed, and death upon death upon death.

If I am understanding you correctly, you think the heart of their hatred for the USA is related to our support for Israel and the presence of troops in Saudi Arabia.  That may be, but there are problems with simplisticly removing the sources of their anger.    Keep in mind that Israel was founded by the UN in 1947 or 1948.  Yes, the existing inhabitants (now known as Palestinians, though there was not a Palestine at that time)were forced out of their homes, but you could (and I am very hesitant to do so because of the obvious implications to the US concerning Native American Indians) point out that the Israelis were driven out of that land that had been theirs for 2000 years.  Additionally, the occupied territories were occupied because the Arab countries have attacked Israel 2 or 3 times and lost.  Israel took those lands to offer additional protection from future attack.  I could be wrong, but I think that technically, a state of war still exists between Israel and Syria, meaning that Israel would be idiotic to surrender the Golan Heights (very strategic land) back to Syria.  In the ultimate irony, the radical Palestinians and Arabs want to drive the Israelis into the sea and exterminate them.  Do you recall the fighting in Kosovo a few years ago?  The Serbs (Christians) were trying to wipe out the Kosovars (Muslims).  Kind of ironic that we (USA/NATO) stopped the ethnic cleansing there, yet religiously related people want us to turn a blind eye and let them wipe out Jews.  As for Saudi Arabia, we may be 'spoiling' sacred lands in the eyes of some Muslims, but we are there at the request and with the permission of the Saudi Royal Family (government).  If the extermists want us gone that bad, then they should petition for a change in their governments policy.  We don't generally stay where the government does not want us to be.  Caving in to the actions of terrorists will set a very bad example for future events.  What happens when the hypothetical pure Islamic nation existis, stretching from Tunisia to Pakistan and Turkey to Sudan, and they then decide that their Eurpoean  or Indian neighbors are living the corrupt lives of infidels.  Given the past effectiveness of their terroristic activities, they will try them again, seeing weakness.  As with most things, there are no simple answers, and I have no grandiose ideas.  But, appeasement does not work.  Just ask Neville Chamberlain.
If we don't have anything the fire ants want, they go away.  Eliminate the reason.  If we want to get our Retaliation Jones on, eliminate the reason while simultaneously taking out a few nests.  But if we don't eliminate the reason, we have to exterminate all fire ants, everywhere, for all time, faster than they can respond.    Another argument that has been added to the original one:  terrorists act out of hatred of liberty.  For crying out loud.  They act out because they want something to change, somewhere.  We may agree or disagree with that thing they want changed, and we can certainly be angry about their method, but don't avoid the issue by saying they're just mean people.  There is such a thing as kleptomania, and I can imagine a thrill in the act, but in general people steal things because they want them.  All the alarms and police in the world won't stop thieves until everyone has what they want.  Of course, meeting everyone's material desires is impossible.  But we can *combine* deterrents (police, locks, alarms) with strategies that target the cause:  we can educate people in how to get jobs, and show them the rewards of individual work -- both in material wealth and individual pride.  Our country does fairly well with this; I feel confident there is less stealing here than in, say, poor South American cities where there is a lot of law enforcement (though corrupt), no path to education and no honor in a hard day's work or in providing for a family.  My point being, arguing that people steal because they want things, can lead to nearly comprehensive solutions.  But arguing that people steal because they're evil -- what could that approach possibly solve?  Terrorists hate America not because they hate liberty -- I'm sure some of the 9/11 hijackers enjoyed a few shopping malls on the sly -- but because of clear (to them) wrongs that have been committed.  Ignore their reasons in the response, and they keep on coming.  Paint over those reasons with a gloss of 'They hate liberty!  They hate freedom!', and Joe Dimwit Public will happily welcome black+white villains he can zap with his ray gun.  See, the argument has kept roaming farther and farther afield of critical thinking.  Instead of smoking out terrorists, sometimes by force, we're told that we're attacking evil people who hate liberty and freedom.  I still feel there's a strong argument to be made for war -- but somewhere it got lost when we all started wrapping ourselves in the flag and the righteous justice of Almighty God.  P.S. You can search Ebert's reviews by various fields, one of which is # of stars.  Other movies have received 0's and 1/2s.

what we need right now is a well thought out and cutting rebuttal from mr. chris king.  oh destruction, where art thou?
To clarify:  I said the Bush administration *had* a strong case, but exchanged it for weaker one.  Based on the original argument, I support a (brief and decisive) war with full and fair closure for Iraq.  The second (and current) argument, which has added that Saddam is evil to his people, that Iraq as a country is a direct threat to us, that we want to rescue the Iraqi people, is nonsense to me; there are many evil leaders, Iraq is an *in*direct threat by way of terrorists (re: original argument), and there are millions of people all over the world who are oppressed whom we don't 'rescue.'  To me, these arguments fail to support war, and adding them to the original argument has clouded the issue and left me unsatisfied.  I am left supporting the war for a compelling reason that has since been buried under what sells on TV.  I feel like I'm at a football game where I'm cheering for my school because I want us in the championships, while everyone around me is cheering for my school because they hate the opposing coach.  I don't care about the other coach.  I can't join in and cheer as loudly under those conditions.  As to the argument that terrorists will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate, etc.:  as I stated before, I believe this is only half right.  If fights break out at the roadhouse because everyone's high on drugs, and we respond by arresting everyone and shutting down the roadhouse, sure there will be no more fights.  But the drugs will move to another roadhouse.  And we don't have the resources nor the will to eliminate all roadhouses, then all bars, then all clubs, then, then, then....  If we don't address the reason in some way, the only sure solution is the arresting or killing of all violent Muslims, throughout the world.  Good luck managing that.  This enemy isn't a Nazi government, a country to be contained.  They're individual people, full of anger they feel is justified, who can wander about freely like ants.  It would be mighty (darkly) funny if we elminated all WMD throughout the world, and the day after we declared victory, some random fellow got lucky and piloted a hijacked airliner into the Lake Anna nuclear plant.  For that matter, after WMDs are eliminated, what's next -- fertilizer?  If our only response is to neutralize them, we had better kill them all, every last one, quickly, utterly, completely, and erase them forever from the history books so that all their relatives and descendents will forget they ever existed.  Rage never dies, and it always finds a way.
I'm sure this will surprise few (if any) of you.  I support the impending conflict.  I have a hard time calling it a war for two reasons.  First, Congress will not declare war.  Second, just as the Tampa Bay Bucaneers playing Lee-Davis High School is not a football game, the US military versus the remnants of the Iraqi military is not a war.  Given the tenacity of the Israelis, I think they could defeat Iraq in a conventional fight.  Those last two words are the key to me.  Both Johnathan and Miriam have said that the Bush administration has not made a strong case for going to war with Iraq.  I have no doubt that Iraq has WMD.  Probably not nuclear, as nuclear material has a habit of leaving a foot print, but biological and chemical are much harder to track.  I have no doubt that our intelligence agencies, embarassed and pissed off about their gaffes pre-September 11, 2001, have sources and proof of these WMD.  For two reasons (alerting Sadaam of what we know and having him move them and protecting our intelligence sources), we have not come out and said 'OK, over here they have 2 tons of Anthrax, and over there they have 500 gallons of VX.  There are weapons that Iraq previously admitted having that are unaccounted for.  That is scary.  It would not take much for Sadaam to give these things to Osama and his buddies, if it meant hurting the US.  Yes, Sadaam is considered an infidel by OBL.  I'm sure Sadaam considers OBL a madman (funny, when you think about Sadaam's mental state).  They don't like each other, true.  But, their hatred of us (and western culture in general) is greater.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend (for now).  Why do you think we supported Iraq in their war against Iran?  Because we thought Sadaam was a righteous dude?  Heck no.  It was because our choices of opposition to Iran (who was holding the hostages) were extremely limited (the Soviet Union, like that would happen, and Afghanistan, who, oh by the way, had been invaded by the Soviet Union.  So, we made a deal with the devil in the name of trying to get our people back.  So, if OBL sent Sadaam a message saying he had a way to get a WMD into NYC, DC, or LA, don't you think he would give OBL whatever was needed to deliver it there?  I agree, peace and diplomacy should always be the first option, but we have had 12 years of defiance of the terms Sadaam agreed to as part of the end of the Gulf War.  That is the difference between 'defying' an optional treaty that you didn't sign (Kyoto and the International War Crimes) versus a treaty that was part of the terms of your surrender.  How much longer are we supposed to give him to comply?  At what point do we say enough is enough?  When a city disappears in a mushroom cloud or a VX bomb goes of in Central Park?  Three thousand people were killed a year and half ago by Islamic extremists.  They will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate anywhere in the world and give them no support structure supplying weapons and money.  Now, if it ends up that Iraq does not have WMD, you will see a huge backlash against Bush, and Edwards/Kerrey/Clinton/Gephardt will be the next president.  That, quite frankly, scares the hell out of me.  But, if the peoples trust is broken, Bush will not survive politically.
Regardless of one's opinion regarding Iraq, it is undeniable that should individuals or groups decide to retaliate, it will be us -- you, me, our families, our friends -- who will be the favored target.  We -- the citizens of this country -- are about to be enlisted in a cause for which we may die.  Not the soldiers, not the pilots, not the marines -- us.  The question is not are you willing to sacrifice the professional soldiers for this cause -- but are you willing to sacrifice yourself, on the battlefield of the shopping mall or apartment building?  Are you willing to trade the life of your three-year-old so that peace will prevail?  Because the Apache helicopter is awfully hard to hit.  But a playground, now -- right down the road from you -- that's easy pickings.  I suspect a great many people have not made the logical connection from the desert waaaaay over there to their own office building.  Sure, we watched the WTC fall; we watched the people jumping from windows.  But it is human nature to believe oneself immortal; to believe it's all a video game.  Which it is, until the stage catches fire and the night club is filling with smoke and you're reminded that Hey, dude, this is, like, real.  This posting is not for or against the war -- just a reminder that a vote for it is a tacit acceptance of the possibility that the cost of the goal will not be professional soldiers, but your niece, burned or gassed or diseased or shot.  Granted, one may feel that is going to happen anyway, so what the hell.  And a valid argument can be made for that.  I just hope our eyes are open.  Wide.
okay - i promise last post for awhile -  urlLink http://www.ready.gov/index.html
from an article in the washington post No definitive price tag or time limit has been put on the plan, and officials stressed that much remains unknown about the length of a potential conflict, how much destruction would result, and 'how deep' the corruption of the Iraqi government goes. The administration has declined to estimate how long U.S. forces would remain in Iraq. Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman told Congress last week that it might be two years before the Iraqis regained administrative control of their country. But 'they're terrified of being caught in a time frame,' said retired Army Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, one of a number of senior military and civilian experts who have been briefed by the Pentagon on the plan. 'My own view is that it will take five years, with substantial military power, to establish and exploit the peace' in Iraq.
op ed from the ny times February 21, 2003 The Martial Plan By PAUL KRUGMAN    he Marshall Plan was America's finest hour. After World War I, the victors did what victors usually do: they demanded reparations from the vanquished. But after World War II America did something unprecedented: it provided huge amounts of aid, helping both its allies and its defeated enemies rebuild.   It wasn't selfless altruism, of course; it was farsighted, enlightened self-interest. America's leaders understood that fostering prosperity, stability and democracy was as important as building military might in the struggle against Communism.   But one suspects that our current leaders would have jeered at this exercise in 'nation-building.' And they are certainly following a very different strategy today.  It's not that the Bush administration is always stingy. In fact, right now it is offering handouts right and left. Most notably, it has offered the Turkish government $26 billion in grants and loans if it ignores popular opposition and supports the war.   Some observers also point out that the administration has turned the regular foreign aid budget into a tool of war diplomacy. Small countries that currently have seats on the U.N. Security Council have suddenly received favorable treatment for aid requests, in an obvious attempt to influence their votes. Cynics say that the 'coalition of the willing' President Bush spoke of turns out to be a 'coalition of the bought off' instead.  But it's clear that the generosity will end as soon as Baghdad falls.  After all, look at our behavior in Afghanistan. In the beginning, money was no object; victory over the Taliban was as much a matter of bribes to warlords as it was of Special Forces and smart bombs. But President Bush promised that our interest wouldn't end once the war was won; this time we wouldn't forget about Afghanistan, we would stay to help rebuild the country and secure the peace. So how much money for Afghan reconstruction did the administration put in its 2004 budget?  None. The Bush team forgot about it. Embarrassed Congressional staff members had to write in $300 million to cover the lapse. You can see why the Turks, in addition to demanding even more money, want guarantees in writing. Administration officials are insulted when the Turks say that a personal assurance from Mr. Bush isn't enough. But the Turks know what happened in Afghanistan, and they also know that fine words about support for New York City, the firefighters and so on didn't translate into actual money once the cameras stopped rolling.   And Iraq will receive the same treatment. On Tuesday Ari Fleischer declared that Iraq could pay for its own reconstruction ?even though experts warn that it may be years before the country's oil fields are producing at potential. Off the record, some officials have even described Iraqi oil as the 'spoils of war.'   So there you have it. This administration does martial plans, not Marshall Plans: billions for offense, not one cent for reconstruction.   Of course, postwar reconstruction in Europe and Japan wasn't just a matter of money; America can also be proud of the way it built democratic institutions. Alas, the Bush administration's postwar political plans are even more alarming than its economic nonchalance.   Turkey has reportedly been offered the right to occupy much of Iraqi Kurdistan. Yes, that's right: as we move to liberate the Iraqis, our first step may be to deliver people who have been effectively independent since 1991 into the hands of a hated foreign overlord. Moral clarity!   Meanwhile, outraged Iraqi exiles report that there won't be any equivalent of postwar de-Nazification, in which accomplices of the defeated regime were purged from public life. Instead the Bush administration intends to preserve most of the current regime: Saddam Hussein and a few top officials will be replaced with Americans, but the rest will stay. You don't have to be an Iraq expert to realize that many very nasty people will therefore remain in power ?more moral clarity! ?and that the U.S. will in effect take responsibility for maintaining the rule of the Sunni minority over the Shiite majority.  If this all sounds incredibly callous and shortsighted, that's because it is. But then what did you expect? This administration doesn't worry about long-term consequences ?just look at its fiscal policy. It wants its war; there's not the slightest indication that it's interested in the boring, expensive task of building a just and lasting peace.

We continue to avoid the strongest argument: Even though Asia is worth 7 armies, there are only three reasons to hold the Middle East:  (1) as a buffer for holding Africa, (2) as a buffer for holding Europe (though the Ukraine and Southern Europe are the weaker points); and (3) as a launching point for the seizing of Australia. Personally, I think our time would be better spent taking South America and holding tight for a while; once Alaska or Quebec falls, we need an escape route. Then again -- maybe we just need another card to complete a set.

hmmm.. why i'm against the war with iraq.  1. there seems to be no defined reason why we are specifically going to war with iraq as opposed to any other nation.  they are other countries which have violated u.n. sanctions and decrees (here in the us we simply don't sign the agreements or ignore them) 2. iraq is not a genuine threat to u.s. interests - which violates the powell doctrine (colin powell) that the u.s. should only enter a war when u.s. interests are clearly at stake - he bases that philosophy on his experiences in vietnam. 3. there is limited public support for this war.  a war without public support is not likely to get the funding it needs to be successful. 4. yes, of course, we could win the war against iraq if all we wanted to do was to bomb it and then leave.however,  bush has said that there will be a regime change.  this will require years of occupation by the u.s. military in order to have a peaceful transition - if one is possible.  after an u.s. invasion - it is likely that muslim fundamentalist will be the most organized and well-funded group in iraq. 5. assuming the u.s. does win this war, the kurds, which at this time mainly occupied the u.n. controlled northern half of iraq, would demand their own country.  this would cause unrest in turkey which has a sizeable kurdish population.  turkey would not want to give up land or anything else to the kurds - the kurds are considered 'terrorists' in turkey. 6. as mr. wigglepants pointed out, this also does not solve any of the problems that exist in the middle east.  the islamic population will still believe that the u.s. is occupying muslim lands and should leave.  the palestinians  will still not have a homeland.  the israelis will still be hated by the rest of the middle eastern community.   7. war is wrong unless it is the absolute last resort - diplomacy is still an option. 8.  what gives the u.s. the right to dispose of a leader?  and why just saddam hussein?  where does it go from here?  9. how does this fight the war on terrorism?  will we be safer after this?

OK, I'll rise to it....  IMHO: Military Intelligence is still an oxymoron. Politicians still get the military into trouble by overpromising. The military still sucks at PR. War is still an ugly, tiring, destructive thing that hurts people, sometimes permenantly.  I think that second marketplace that was hit (the one that killed 50+ Iraqi civilians) was planted by Iraqi security forces -- the timing was too convenient, and they didn't do anything to restrict reports from reporting on it -- even better -- they  encouraged  reporters to go there and see for themselves.  We're in for the long-haul, kids. So sit back and stay tuned.   Finally, it still stirs something very primal in me to see 65 tons of depleted uranium and hardened steel churning across a desert at 55 miles an hour.... Does anyone else want to agree with me if I said I missed my calling as a tank commander?  P.S. Don't be misled by that 1.3 million number for our armed forces -- a solid majority are not involved in actual combat.... The Army is going to be so committed to Iraq that if something else happens (North Korea, anyone?), we're going to be in deep kimchee....

angie - could you please check your email - and i bleached it on sunday, dyed black on monday  and for an update on the hypothetical situation presented earlier:   after begging and pleading with his boss and humilating himself entirely, he was able to get the time off and can now meet my parents.  he also apologized about 50 times.  unfortunately for him, i  took harmony's advice and have burned all of his athletic shoes.  fortunately for him, he only had one pair.
No, no -- share your petty rage!  And I will share my petty foreboding.  This fellow appears to have been very thoughtless.  Anger is valid.  I recommend piling all his athletic shoes in the tub and setting them on fire.
thank you so much for your insight, sir happyslacks - i will be sure to keep my petty rage to myself from now on.
I think you should get really, really, really mad, because that always makes things better.
oh, and he was supposed to meet your parents for the first time, and your parents were making a special effort to be there and had to take time off work in order to be at this prearranged dinner.
question: let's say someone does something unintentionally and pisses you off.   example:  you were supposed to go out to dinner on wednesday night - it is the sunday before that wednesday when your dining companion tells you that he forgot and he already agreed to work late that night and he won't be home until 10pm.   he apologizes profusely and tries to switch days with someone but is unable to do so.    how mad should you get at the person for forgetting his schedule and ruining your plans?
Humans in general.  Americans seem particularly fearful, and strangely proud and defensive of it.  I'm beginning to think that a consumer-based society cannot thrive without fear.
Do you mean human beings in general or just Americans?
An observation:  We seem unable to function without fear.  Whether the reaction is passive or aggressive, our identity seems almost entirely dependent upon fear.  Try to take fear away from the fearful, and they get angry.  There is a fierce pride in fear:  the fearful perceive fear as a sign of intelligence; those without fear are deemed stupid or ill-informed.  It is smart to be afraid of labor unions; it is stupid to be afraid of corporations.  It is smart to be afraid of our nuclear arsenal; it is stupid to be afraid of public health care.  It seems nearly impossible to make any decision free of fear.  Fear appears to be not an emotion, but rather the inescapable, invisible framework of human experience.  Without fear and our reaction to it, we are nothing.

thought this might infuriate john and chris; inspire ben and well, i guess just me and ben - Director Moore criticizes U.S.-Iraq war  March 23, 2003  |     Michael Moore criticized President Bush and the U.S.-led war in Iraq during his acceptance speech at Sunday's Academy Awards, drawing a partial standing ovation and some jeers from Hollywood's elite.   The documentary maker won his first Oscar for Bowling for Columbine, but he brought the other nominees on stage with him in what he called a show of solidarity for nonfiction during these fictitious times.   We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elect a fictitious president, Moore said. We live in a time where we have a man who's sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fiction of orange alerts.   Applause gave way to some boos, as the orchestra began playing to cue the filmmaker to leave the stage.   We are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Moore shouted.   Afterward, host Steve Martin tried to restore levity.   It was so sweet backstage, you should have seen it, Martin joked. The Teamsters were helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.   Bowling for Columbine was Moore's exploration of gun violence in America. The title refers to the fact that gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went bowling before they opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado, killing 12 students and a teacher before turning the guns on themselves.   Asked backstage why he made the remarks, Moore answered: I'm an American.   Is that all? a reporter asked.   Oh, that's a lot, Moore responded.   He dismissed the jeers he received, telling reporters: Don't report that there was a split decision in the hall because five loud people booed.   The rotund, scruffy-bearded activist from Flint, Mich., also directed the 1989 documentary Roger & Me, in which he pursued former General Motors Corp. boss Roger Smith to confront him about the collapse of the auto industry in Moore's hometown.   He's also the author of the best-selling book Stupid White Men ... And Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation, which criticizes American politicians for favoring corporate wealth over public well-being.   Scattered appeals for peace and grim reports from the U.S.-led war in Iraq added a sober contrast to Hollywood's traditional night of glitzy self-glorification.   In light of all the troubles in this world, I wish us all peace, Chris Cooper said during his acceptance speech for best supporting actor for Adaptation.   Cooper was among several nominees, including Meryl Streep and Martin Scorsese, who wore dove peace pins on their formal wear as a silent statement about the war
Black was probably a respect for the war/soldiers thing, I'm thinking.  Halle Berry's dress was a bit unflattering...and it's hard to NOT flatter that body.  I kind of liked J Lo's sea-foam mumu.  It was very 70's and fun to me.  I liked that Nicole Kidman and Susan Sarandon had dresses with similar necklines...it was so faux pas, and it made me laugh to think that they might have seen each other and said, 'Shit!' when they got there.    Yes, I'm breaking up with Johnathan and moving to wherever it is that Adrian Brody lives, a location unknown to me, as I have never actually met him and I am totally kidding.  That's just sort of the Angie way of saying that I really like him.  Kind of like how Liv Tyler and Angelina Jolie are my girlfriends.    Oh, and by the way, I've decided that I did not like the color that Julia Roberts had dyed her hair.  It didn't do anything for her skin tone.  And Kate Hudson's hair, skin and dress were all the same color...she looked like a walking tan with lips.  It was a little strange.  I thought Diane Lane looked fabulous though.  And I think Catherine Zeta-Jones is just so cute when she's pregnant.  The only acting I've ever seen her do that I really liked was 'Zorro' and 'Traffic,' so I'm not like a huge fan or anything, but she makes a darn tootin' cute lil pregnant lady.    I worry that Julianne Moore will suffer from Meryl Streep Syndrome and be nominated a jillion times and not win (although Meryl did win two, but that was 20+ years ago, and she's been nominated MANY more times since).  I really hope she gets one someday, because she's just really first-rate.  This was going to be a short post that turned into a long ramble because I'm avoiding doing my task at work, i.e., labeling and taping brochure mail-outs.  Blah.  Save me.
blech.  i like the 'real' aragorn much better. and yes, the dress did look fabulous on zellweger. what was up with all the black last night?  and halle berry was not wearing a flattering dress - and what was up with j.lo and her sea foam mumu? i'm not sure if i liked nicole kidman's dress or not... adrian brody is your new boyfriend?  congrats - does this mean you are moving?
Oh, and by the way, Mir...   urlLink This  is the would-be Aragorn, Stuart Townsend.  Thank God he and Jackson didn't get along, 'cause Viggo is just...well...yeah.
Now that some of you from the game have watched the Oscars...do you NOW believe me when I say Renee Zellweger is a twig?  Pretty dress, though.  Good color for her.  And can I just say that I am SO happy that we can now say the phrase 'Academy Award winner Eminem'?  Think of him what you will...it really is a damn fine song.  And Adrian Brody is my new boyfriend.
Chris - Do you really need my answers?  You should know them already.  1)  FALSE.  2) FALSE.  3) FALSE  As for the oil argument, I can think of three much easier targets militarily and one domestically than spending billions of dollars invading a relatively well defended country.  Let's see, there is (in order of hardest to easiest) 3) Venezuela - Right in the middle of extreme labor unrest, very close to the US.  Would not require as much in the way of a logistics train.  (As a side note, Venezuela is the main reason we have had the price spikes in gas.  They are still only operating at 20% of their normal petroleum output).  2)  Saudi Arabia - We already have more troops in Saudi than they do and we have 250,000 in Kuwait.  It would take like 2 days to 'conquer' them.  And the easiest is 1)Kuwait - Our military is already there.  We could just claim victory and take hold of some of the richest oil fileds in the world.  Of course, the domestic option is drilling in ANWAR, but we know that won't happen.
My head spins with the fast-moving dialogue on this here blog.  Lookout.
Just got home from it an hour ago, still exhausted...went well...LONG day...more later.
1. I believe oil is one reason of several, and the coalition gives varying priorities to each.  I would need more information and expertise to rank them on my own; however, I do doubt the validity of some of the reasons, only because they are not treated equally in all situations.  2. I cannot speak re: time and the recent inspections because they were not executed in a way I felt effective; their flawed methods rendered them inconsequential; thus, time was irrelevant.  3. I believe that in general, lasting self-governance cannot be forced; it can only be chosen.  I say 'in general' because I don't believe in absolutes; there is always the possibility of an exception.  I would be delighted for the outcome to show that Iraq is an exception.  -- I respectfully decline Chris' offer of immunity; others are free to respond to my post.
hey ang, how did  your audition go?
Mir: Please tell me you don't really believe that oil is the reason we are at war. Please tell me that you are just writing the party line because you are in the grip of dispair and it is prevent you from thinking for yourself.   For that matter, by a voice vote -- who here believes oil the the reason we are at war? I am very curious about the legs on this line of thinking. For that matter (again):  Who here thinks that giving the inspectors more time would have brought this crisis to a peaceful conclusion? Who believes that leaving Saddam Hussein in power in Iraq is better for the Iraqi people than giving them a shot at self-governance?  All you lurkers out there -- here's your chance to chime in. I won't lecture or post about your responses -- I'm just curious about how everyone is feeling about this adventure. So, to recap, three questions, true or false answers -- and if you'd like, email me (crk@mindspring.com): 1. Oil is the reason we are at war. 2. Allowing the inspectors more time to search Iraq would have lead to a peaceful conclusion. 3. Leaving Saddam Hussein in power is better for the Iraqi people than giving them a shot at self-governance (with the very real possibility of chaos and failure to create a viable government).  P.S. 40?!?! Thanks, man. I wasn't feeling old until now!  8-p
The Independent Speaks:  In this case, I would much prefer conservatives proved right than liberals proved right.  The war is under way and it is beyond my control; the only healthy way to live is to release oneself from concern about things one cannot control, and instead reserve judgment until more information becomes available.  Despair serves no one, least of all oneself.  For today's events, I choose hope.
so it would, harmony.  but i, i feel powerless in this war situation.  i don't agree with it; it sickens me to think of people dying for oil, but i do not know what i can do about it.  bar angie, we come from a generation of those who are apathetic.  we grew up believing that at any time our entire nation could be lost by nuclear warfare, our entire planet could be destroyed by uncontrolled hostilities.  that must do something to a person to believe those things.   and people will die - and the region will become even more fundamentalist and destablilized and my life will stay the same - going from one moment of happiness to a moment of sadness.  people i love will please me and betray me - people i dislike will stay the same.

irony. IRONY, damn you!  happy belated birthday, chris.  stay dry, everybody...
The Dune and Raiders references re: a sandstorm and divine intervention, on the eve of a war with religious undertones, struck me as amusing.  I assume you are joking in interpreting my post as implying that I want a sandstorm to wipe out the US Army.  The irony of Paul's quote re: the sandstorm, on the eve of the current war, is that it could apply to both sides.  That's as far as the implication, such as it is, goes.  It seemed an appropriate attempt at humor, perhaps even commentary, given the title of our blog.
Got an email from my mom -- she says these points are from Dennis Miller (tho I doubt it), but the selected ones below elicited a chuckle: 1. Between president bush and Saddam Hussein ... Hussein is the bad guy.  2. If you have faith in the United Nations to do the right thing keep  this in mind, they have Libya heading the committee on human rights and Iraq  heading the global disarmament committee. Do your own math here  3. If you use google search and type in 'French military victories,'  your reply will be 'did you mean French military defeats?'  4. If your only anti-war slogan is 'no war for oil,' sue your school  district for allowing you to slip through the cracks and robbing you of the  education you deserve.  5. Saddam and bin laden will not seek United Nations approval before  they try to kill us.  ... 7. Even if you are anti-war, you are still an 'infidel!' and bin laden  wants you dead, too.  ... 10. Whether you are for military action or against it, our young men  and women overseas are fighting for us to defend our right to speak out. We  all need to support them without reservation.
Anyone care to lay odds on whether the French embassy in Baghdad will be 'accidently' destroyed during the bombing campaign or during the street fighting?   John -- SciFi is not the issue -- access to the VCR is. See, with the jury-rigged set up I have going so I can use the damned cable box  and  the picture-in-picture feature of my beloved TV, I had to set up the VCR so that you watch what you tape. And since I am outnumbered and surrounded in the scifi fan department up here, Saddam's got a better chance of scoring a town home on South Beach in Miami than I have in taping the durned thing. I'll replace the tape(s), if you would be so kind!  Let's see Harmony -- are you trying to tell us that the US Army should be wiped out by a sandstorm?
I wonder how many Countdown parties are happening this evening.  Everyone counts down to 8pm and shouts 'Huzzah!'....though you can't tell because everyone's drunk and wearing gas masks.

Jones: Tanis is one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark. (Lost Ark?)  The Ark of the Covenant, the chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments in...the original stone tablets that Moses brought down out of Mt. Heron and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing...The Hebrews took the broken pieces and put them in the Ark. When they settled in Canaan, they put the Ark in a place called the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, where it stayed for many years, until, all of a sudden, whoosh, it was gone.  (Gone?  Where?)  Nobody knows where.  Brody: However, an Egyptian pharaoh Shishak invaded the city of Jerusalem around about 980 BC and he may have taken the Ark back to the city of Tanis and hidden it in a secret chamber called the Well of Souls... However, about a year after the pharaoh had returned to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year, wiped clean by the wrath of God....
urlLink Praying is fine, but Bush should make up his own mind    I keep returning to thoughts of Bush's face and voice during that extraordinary press conference. He said he was convinced he was doing the right thing, but I sensed no enthusiasm for the task. He was not trying to persuade us, excite us, convert us or lead us. He was simply telling us what he had to do.   The pope sent a cardinal from the Vatican to have an hour's discussion with Bush--not about politics, but about theology. The cardinal told the president that the pope disagrees that God supports an invasion of Iraq. ''God does not intervene in the affairs of man,'' the papal emissary said.     - excerpt from an urlLink  article  by Roger Ebert

Angie - I took absolutely no offense at your post.  It just made me realize what I did not know.  Ah, jazz.  I love big band.  I'm not much into the recent (last 20 years) jazz.  As a whole, American attempts at orchestral music (movie soundtracks not included) have been pathetic.  Bernstein had some attempts at 'good' orchestral music (Candide Overture).  Copland was the best American composer in my opinion.  But, you can't beat 'the continent' for good classical music.  From Bach through Beethoven to Tchaikovsky (yeah, Russian, but close enough), they had some incredible talent.  I guess what it comes down to is I will admit that, as a whole, European culture, which is after all what all the things we are talking about make up, is better than American.  Hell, we can't even make a decent beer.  I still prefer living in the heathen US, wearing my holy blue jeans, ratty old t-shirt, eating my cheeseburger, deep fried potatoe strips, and watching American football on TV, or better yet, laughing at some of the ugly dresses the actresses wear to all the awards shows.

In my opinion, America has given the world two unique things of lasting value: (1) jazz, and (2) jeans (though this could be expanded to 'The West' in general).  Everything else is a synthesis of something else.  But in terms of contributing beauty to the world, America alone can claim jazz.  I personally find that a great honor.
Also John...  I wasn't trying to attack your taste in food and/or clothing...just answering your questions.
Oh, I wouldn't consider myself all that high fashion or in-crowd either...I just know names and products, but I can't afford any of it.  Loreal is a makeup company, but it's a parent company to other professional salon hair and make-up products as well...Laurent is a fashion designer, who might specialize in leather goods, and Gotier is actually spelled Gautier or something...he's also a designer.  Does a lot of stuff for Madonna, I think.  Anywho, leather goods, hair & makeup (and fragrance) AND clothes are all parts of 'fashion,' which is why I lumped them all together.  For example, Calvin Klein also has a line of cosmetics and cologne, as well as shoes, underwear, clothing, etc.  Croissants are extremely bad for you.  But they're oh-so tasty.  I hold that the reason why European nations like France and Italy aren't obese despite all of the foods they eat is this:  lifestyle.  They relax.  Work is not what defines them like it is in the U.S.  They take their time in preparing their food, eating their food, living their lives.  They have siesta.  They are not so focused on making money and working hard as they are living and enjoying life and each other.  And I think that lowered stress level really does a lot in terms of how they look.  I think we as Americans are always go go go...eating instant foods, full of preservatives, shoving them in our gullets as quickly as possible so we can go go go some more.  We're all fat because we don't digest.  And we don't sleep and rest as we should, so our bodies don't metabolize the same way.  Our work ethic is very different from theirs.    And this is not to say that one way is better than the other.  We make LOTS more money here because of our Protestant work ethic.  It's part of what makes us a capitalist nation.  But it's also a big part of why we're a fat nation, too...

Okay, guys.  I know it's been a while, but I have been trying to catch up here and I just ran across Mir's comments about the Iraqis' looting situation and 'we knew about the culture and history and all we protected was the Oil Ministry.  What does that say about us?'  It says we follow through on our word.  President Bush warned the Iraqi soldiers to not attempt to sabotage the oil reserves because it belonged to the Iraqi people not Saddam and his regime.  The revenues the oil can create would be neccessary for the Iraqis to rebuild their country.  This said, there was a plan in place to protect the Oil Ministry and the oil fields for the benefit of the Iraqis.    Alternately, there was not neccessarily a plan to protect other specific places, because who knew where the certain chaos that was to follow would erupt.  What were they supposed to do anyway, shoot the unarmed civilians?  That would have been all they could have done to stop it.  The crowds were enormous that were taking part in the looting.  The Liberals would have been screaming then that the innocent, unarmed looters had been shot!  Unfortunately, the looting happened, but it was bound to happen.  But, I'm sorry, protecting a museum was probably the last thing on the minds of the soldiers as they were watching there backs for remnants of the Republican Guard or the Fedayeen...

Given that 1) I am a corporate slave using MS products or products that only seem to run on PCs (AutoCAD and it's associated engineering software) and 2) That an easier to use download system is not incentive enough for me to change my home systems, I guess I will make do with my rickety old PCs.  Oh, if only Apple had not been so stubborn about closed architecture 20 years ago.  Bill Gates would not be obscenely rich and computers would be more stable.

I just dreamed that this guy I work with was antagonizing me and kept trying to steal my wig (???).  He's like 6'4', but I jumped on his back and started beating him with my fists and legs.  He finally got me off him and disappeared in his wife's car, 'cause in a fit of rage I'd smashed the hell out of his van.
Sounds like someone is finding healing in the arms of the Dream King.  I am happy for you.
hey, umm, ben, it's spring.  put up another goddamn post!!!
yes, you are correct, the first part was definitely meant as a joke.a  negative self-image can exist at any age.  god knows it took me years of therapy to get rid of mine.   i had d&d dreams last night.  but about the actual sessions.  we were all in johnathan's house except it was bigger and had a wall of windows on the bottom floor and his mother lived with him.  angie slept on couch in the living room but right before we left she transformed it into a room that was the color of a sunset.  it was beautiful. ben was the dungeon master and he seemed irritated that was no one was paying attention and everyone seemed more interested in eating.  i just woke up so everything is still fresh in mine but i'm still too tired to be terrribly coherent.   jimi was there and someone was challenging him about the rules.  i think they were getting ready to have a big rules-off.  it was fun and i needed to have fun dreams last night.  i'm grateful to my mind.
I doubt that a negative self-image is limited only to children due for recess, nor that it can be easily dismissed as immaturity.  I understand your opening comment was a joke, but it is still unfortunate that many think that way.
i don't know harmony.  would that be happening before, during, or after recess?   what would matter would be the intent of the person saying it.  if someone happens not to find someone attractive who i think may look like me, it generally doesn't bother me.  however, if the person seems to be doing so in order to hurt my feelings then i would think less of the person who said it.  i would definitely not think less of myself.
For the record, the two 'tall ones' are around 5'7' or 5'8', according to my cursory online research.  I agree that language is far too limited.  I was told once by a girl in high school, 'You know, you're not, like, gorgeous, but you're not like butt-ugly either.' Eloquence.  *gag*
Mir -- So if I saw an entertainer who you think looks like you, and I described her in an insulting way, would that bother you?  Just a hypothetical.
please john don't pass out but i agree with you on this.  they are entertainers - part of their job is to be judged on their appearance.  they went into this profession voluntarily - knowing that there would insults but also great financial rewards.   but i would still say that she has great hair.
Perhaps the problem lies in our language.  In general, we have two words to describe a body type:  thin/fat; tall/short/; etc.  We are a culture of extremes and linguistically-enforced simplicity.  Our language is so pitiful that we often resort to numbers to express ourselves ('Are you happier today?' 'In terms of happy I'm about a 6, maybe a 7.')  For all the praise Indo-European languages receive, more often than not our choices are woefully limited.  Unfortunately, being creatures of language, how we speak and communicate greatly shapes our reality.  And so the wars begin -- often because our limited language limits our thinking, and thus our options.  No poetry, no grace -- only simple, concrete linguistic containers into which we attempt to pour the whole of our experience.  I love my car.  I love my wife.  I hate this pizza.  I love my house.  I love this carpet.  I hate that tie.  I hate war.  I hate flying.  I love my parents.  I hate the quiet.  For crying out loud.
Back to my male pigginess.  Looking at the Entertainment Weekly picture, first let me say that the blonde on the right who looks to be about 6' 6' tall would be drop dead gorgeous if she lost some of the eye shadow.  Second, compared to the other two women in the group, Natalie Maines *is* the fat one.  She is not fat.  But, she is heavier than the other two.  When comparing a group of people, men are generally vague in their descriptions.  For example, if I were trying to describe something about that pipcture to another friend who was familiar with it but not their names, I would use the following descriptions - the brunette, the skinny blonde, and the fat or chubby blonde.  I will agree that she is not fat, but it is a comparitive tool.  I could just as easily use short and tall I suppose, but that is not a sure thing since one appears to be standing and the other is kneeling on an elevated platform (I think).  I could go with a description I heard from my boss today and describe where as one with the Porky Piggish face.  I'll stick with the general fat/skinny adjectives.
today sam is spending his last day looking out the window and wanting to be petted.  i'm going to make sure his last day is the best one i can make for him.  thanks for your support angie and john.
As I posted a week or so ago, I am not a huge cat person.  That being said, when Julie and I started dating, she had a cat named Shadow.  It was very much a love me, love my cat situation.  Well, it took about half an hour.  Shadow was a very affectionate cat.  She would generally come when called.  She would even deign to play with us from time to time.  When she was about 14, she became listless and uninterested in eating.  I even tried tuna.  Previously, whenever we would even pop open a can of tuna, eShadow came flying in and loudly meowed and rubbed agains you to let you know what she wanted.  She was still uninterested.  She to stopped using the litter box.  We took her to the vet and she was diagnosed with renal failure.  The vet told us that one of her kidneys had atrophied, and the other was giving out.  We left her with him for 2 days to flush out her system with IV fluids.  For about a week after the treatment, she was fine.  We had switched her to a special kidney friendly food.  But, she eventually started sliding again.  I had the difficult task of coming home one afternoon to find her dead.  It was one of the most upsetting things that has happened in my life, even though I knew it was coming.  That one cat has made me open to the possibility of having cats in the future.  We have opted to wait until the children a older to introduce a kitten.  The bottom line is that I feel for you Mir.
Miriam...my cat Pookie was 14 years old when he was diagnosed with FIV, and he had a stroke which caused him to lose the use of his back legs.  We had to put him to sleep.  It was one of the hardest days of my life.  I understand what you're going through, and I'll be thinking of you, 'cause I know how much you must be hurting right now.    Love for you.
my cat, sam, who i have had for 12 years, was diagnosed today with renal failure, and i will have to put him to sleep tomorrow.  i cannot express how horrible this is and how painful it is to not only to see him suffer, but to be the one who has to decide that it is time for him to die.   i could let him survive for a few more weeks, but he would just be in pain - it would not be the way he would want to live his life.  he was always a very strong and intelligent cat. now he is basically unable to walk more than 5 steps, unable to use the litter box, (he was, before this, a very fastidious animal), covered in his own drool and urine.  i have tried to brush him and to clean him, but he does not seem to know what it's going on. i don't know if he knows me but he still does respond to his name.  i want to believe he knows me - i want him to know that i tried to save him.   but i couldn't and i feel guilty but i know, logically, that i cannot save him. i have held him, rocked him, placed his almost limp body on the bed next to me, my head against his, and i don't know whether to pray for a quick death in his sleep so i don't have to euthanize him tomorrow - so he won't know what has happened.  i have cried so much today and i know in the next few weeks that it will happen again and again.  i love him - i love him as much as someone can love a cat.  and it hurts, damnit.  it hurts so much.  btw, i just wanted to express this - don't feel it would be rude to post a political or satirical or silly comment after this. i know life goes on - i just wanted to get it out.
Mmm hmm.  That's what I thought you said...airbrushed or not:  if she's fat, then I'm a monkey's uncle.

Oooh, now *that's* a story.  Shift the Jedi order so that a master can have two or three apprentices.  Obi-Wan has one apprentice, Qui-Gon, a star pupil in the order.  He then takes on the gifted but troubled Annakin.  Annakin starts to surpass his fellow apprentice; resentment and jealousy brews; something goes wrong; Annakin makes a hotheaded choice that leaves Qui-Gon in a bad spot and he gets killed.  A rift begins between Obi-Wan and Annakin.  Follow through to final confrontation and betrayal.  A whole family unit falls apart.  Mythical, even Biblical.  Wow.  That's great stuff.  I think I'll become famous so one day I'll be at a party where I can walk over and kick Lucas in the shins.
They blew it all to shit anway, so what does it matter now?  Who the fuck is Qui-Gon?  I love Liam, but damn.  Looking at the conceptual art books, etc., I see that Q-G was originally supposed to be Obi-wan's apprentice...that would have made a lot more sense, but here we are.
Now that I think of it, there's no continuity trouble with Chewbacca appearing in III and IV.  In Mos Eisely, we see Obi-Wan discussing with Chewbacca (no dialogue heard, Chewie just nods); a few moments later, Obi-Wan introduces Chewbacca to Luke as 'Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us.'  They could certainly have met before, possibly as pilot and paying passenger.  It would push the irony angle a bit much for me if Chewie had met Annakin before, and thus served as co-pilot for his son on the way to the Death Star.  But then, Darth Vader made Threepio, so what the hell.

John - does your question about advance notice reference the Buddhist carvings?  If so, yes - there was a long build-up; I remember following it.  What interests me is if (a) the world community is responsible for the protection and preservation of specific nation's antiquities, and if so, then (b) how far does this responsibility go?  To public pronouncements?  To sanctions?  To the nation's border?  To physical intervention?  It seems that if it is true that we should have physically prevented the looting of the museums (which would have required wounding and killing many civilians on the building steps), then we should have sent special forces in to stop the destruction in Afghanistan.  What troubles me in a greater sense is that in all the debate about this situation and its implications, many of us are inspired to draw definite lines of principle without thinking just where those lines stop and start.  For example:  If we invaded Iraq to liberate the oppressed, why aren't we planning for the next operation elsewhere in the world?  There are plenty of targets.  If we should not have invaded Iraq because it was about oil, then would anyone have ever been able to stop daily rape, torture, and terror within its borders?  I hear a lot of absolutes, but not a whole lot of thinking.  We seem to prefer a world in bright, contrasting colors, drawn in broad, clear strokes, rather than the contradictory mess it actually is.  We seem to fight for easy definitions rather than face up to the unruly reality.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world is not in the clutches of conservatives, or liberals, or lobbyists, or lawyers; if it is trapped and pinned not by these, but by something completely different.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world -- if humanity -- has finally been overrun by idealists.
B5 Season 2 on DVD - 4/29/03  Chewbacca to be in Episode III.
Miriam (Congratulations, BTW), you are making some gross, as in large, assumptions concerning the looting.  You assume that we were in the area of the museum(s) when they were looted.  Keep in mind that we still have not fully secured Baghdad last I knew.  But, assuming that we were standing right in front of the museum as looting was going on, how should we have stopped hundreds of people from looting/stealing/destroying these artifacts?  Shoot them?  Beat them with the butts of rifles?  The US Army and Marines are not into crowd control.  They are not permitted to operate in a police capacity in the US (posse comitatus).  They don't carry a lot of tear gas, especially when in a war zone.  Their primary job is to identify the enemy, not looter, and shoot him.  Johnnathan - No.  And, did we even have advanced notice of the destruction anyway?
Perhaps I am not being clear.  I'll rephrase:  1) Should people be angry at us because the Iraqis chose to loot their own artifacts and heritage?  2) Should people be angry at us for not stopping the Taliban's destruction of the Buddhist carvings?
short answer: yes.  we should have stopped it.  look at previous posts for justifications.
I appreciate your opinion re: the issue of liberating the Iraqi people from a ruthless dictator.  But that is irrelevant to my question.  Is it our fault that the Iraqi people looted their own artifacts?
Ok, you're right about the slippers.
that's not entirely my point, harmony.  one of the ways we are justifying this war is by saying we are freeing the iraqi people from a ruthless dictator.  when did it become our responsibility to become the world's liberators?  there are over 100 nations that currently are violating u.n. human rights mandates - are we going to invade all of them?  my point being is that we were there, we knew the signifigance of the artifacts; we should have stopped it. and, once again, people are offended that the only place we protected was the ministry of oil.  what message does that send to the iraqi people and the world about why we are there? and madonna you would snatch those slippers up in a second and you know it.
Do you think, if America were invaded and the government overthrown, that we would have looted the Smithsonian?  'Dammit, I just GOTTA have Dorothy's Ruby Slippers!  Now's my chance!!!'
So it is our responsibility to protect people from looting or destroying their own nation's culture and history?
i would think that people are upset about the looting of the iraqi's muesums because the u.s. military did nothing to protect them.   we (the u.s) understood the signifigance of those artifacts even if the iraqi people didn't.  The most disturbing thing is that the only building protected during the looting was the ministry of oil.  it does look poorly on us that we thought that was more important than a nation's culture and history.
Clarificaton:  I am specifically addressing the artifact/museum issue.  I am not addressing the looting of government property or the looting of private businesses and homes.  The former is understandable given the country's oppressive history; the latter, while unfortunate, is standard practice in any riot or period of lawlessness.
I've been thinking about this...how, exactly, is it our fault if Iraqis loot their own historical artifacts?  They're not our children.  It seems to me that if they don't see a difference between stealing a Sony television from a Baath vacation home and stealing jewelery or pottery of their own heritage and history from 4,000 years ago, then that's really their problem, and they should receive the brunt of the outrage.  The fact that looting was possible -- that is our fault, to some degree, for not planning for a more rapid law enforcement plan (assuming one was even possible).  But *what* they loot -- that seems to me to be merely a reflection of either their own wisdom or ignorance.  I share this thought (which may be changed without notice) because the whole affair has sparked in me an interesting question:  Are the historical treasures of a culture the property and responsibility of that culture, or the world at large?  I'm not talking about interest -- of course they're of great *interest* to the world.  But does that interest translate seamlessly into the realm of property and responsbility?  I'm reminded of the Taliban blasting those awesome Buddhist sculptures.  Would there have been justification for external cultures to use force to protect those works on behalf of the world community?  If not, then why all the anger directed at the world community for not stopping Iraqis from looting their own heritage?  Granted, one can argue that the world community created a situation in which looting could flourish -- but does this argument truly address the issue?  At some point, shouldn't a culture or a people show some restraint and control their more childish, primitive passions?  If they are unable to do so -- is that truly our fault?

I don't know.  I am merely a puppet of the NPCs.
my first question:  are you going to tell us the truth or merely lies?
RTG folk: game Sunday.  You are meeting another Font of (Mis?)Information, so have questions ready.
5) Will the male 12-year-old target audience ever figure out that their fantasy hottie is old enough to be their mother? 6) Will Neo recreate the Matrix to resemble the world of Point Break? 7) Will Morpheus tell anyone about his hidden stash of cheeseburgers?
Here is my opinion on what is going on with the Matrix.  In the first one, the machines created a perfect world, but the human mind would not accept it, so it was a 'monumental failure'.  So, they created a second, less than perfect, world.  As the Architect said 99.9% of the people accepted it.  I think that the machines, not being stupid, decided to create another false world outside of the 20th century world.  This is for those 0.1% of minds that could not accept what they saw.  This new world allows them to think that they are fighting for the freedom of mankind and keeps them from noticing the imperfections in the world because Zion is by no means a perfect world.  In the end they are still just coppertops.  I think Neo is the One that can change the laws of both worlds, not just the 20th century one, which we saw at the end with the sentinels.  That is why he is so powerful in the 20th century one, because to him, it is almost like us playing a kids game.  Doing the math, if the 250,000 people in Zion represent the 0.1%, then that means that the population in the matrix is just under 250 million, or just slightly less than the population of the US.  At 12,000 BTU per body, that is 3 billion BTU, which will run a few lightbulbs.  Now, I have several questions remaining  1)  What is Smith up to? 2)  What happened to the Architect? 3)  Is the Oracle working for the System or freelance? 3a)  If the System, why help Neo? 3b)  If freelance, why? 4)  If the people in Zion are plugged into a Matrix, can they wake up?
I could also have had an obtuse moment.  It's certainly happened before.  I may have unconsciously given up on the movie early on, resulting in me not paying close enough attention.  If so, sloppy movie viewing on my part.
I caught it the first time.  I did not think it was obscure.  He was also the guy in the coucil chamber trying to urge his captain to go look for the Nebudchanazar (sp?)
Babylon 5, Season 3 -- August 12
He's the fellow who Smith blends with before he can reach the phone.  Later, he's seen attempting to sneak up on and attack Neo in Zion.  I also missed it at first.  If a key plot point is that difficult to communicate, something's wrong with the writing.  It's the last image of the film, for crying out loud, and a lot of viewers aren't getting it.
spoiler for those of you who havne't seen matrix reloaded:  i didn't know this until i read it on this modern world: the guy at the end is the 'human' agent smith!  i totally missed it while watching it.

In a recent interview, Joss shares the irony that he was able to tell the story he wanted to tell in the Buffy movie -- about a ditzy and self-absorbed girl becoming heroic -- through Cordelia, from her run on 'Buffy' through to her arc on 'Angel'.  Struck me as interesting, the idea of Cordelia playing out the originally-intended movie-Buffy arc, and series-Buffy playing out a whole different outcast-makes-good arc.
The multiple Agent Smiths was the kind of thing I had hoped we'd see in Episode II.  But noooooo, all we got were hundreds of some scruffy guy eating in a cafeteria and stupid ol' clone troopers.
Oh, Jesus, that would have been funny.  Especially if you've seen 'The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,' in which the guy who plays Smith (whose name completely escapes me at this moment...ah, Percocet!) plays flaming drag queen.  'Twould be funny if he had on a little sequin number underneath that smart black suit, and all the Smiths start line dancing to 'We Are Family.'

I'm sure Angie appreciates her importance, and the game will not be postponed.
why don't we just postpone the game until finney can join us?  i don't think waiting another 2 weeks would kill anyone.  i want angie to understand how important she is to the campaign.
Johnathan's right...I will sadly be unable to join you all at Sunday's game.  My energy level is as such right now that I know I'm in the big time if I can walk to the living room and back!  But it's okay...'tis for a worthy cause!  Thank God my desk isn't too far from my bed, 'cause I'm such an internet junkie that I'd die if I couldn't blog and stuff...  On a Buffy note, I just saw Amy (Willow's witch friend that lived as a rat for a while) in a Dove Shampoo commercial.  That's kinda sad.
The good news is, Angie is very pleased with the results -- not only will her Movement rate increase by 5, but she won't have to lose the 'Great Cleavage' feat.
From what I can gather as an observer, the effect of breast reduction surgery is similar to being hit square and full force in the chest with a baseball bat.

good idea johnathan and quite tasty.
From The Washington Post, summarized in The Week:  About 40,000 human embryos are being stored in freezers in fertility clinics throughout the U.S.  Most are leftovers from previous fertility treatments and will never be used.  President Bush has prohibited the embryos from being used in stem cell research, and most couples would prefer to keep them frozen indefinitely, rather than destroy them.  'People just can't cope with the decision,' says an official with the American Infertility Association.  ....until one quiet and otherwise innocuous evening, when, without warning, as one, they all...awakened.
i would say his since he actually wrote the script.

JS -- take care of that woman, my friend. She's good for you.   Hope you feel better soon, Ms. Streisand....
yay!!!!!!!!  congratulations angie!!!!!!
Angie came out of surgery fine, and asked me to give a shout out to the bloggers.  So...shout.  Out.  She returns home Friday afternoon, and it's safe to say neither of us will attempt to get up at 4:15 AM again any time soon.  (Check-in was at 6)  Good god almighty.

i think ben was just trying to be funny about the buffy stuff - i remember when it was basically just ben and me on the blog everyday and i'm sure he is thrilled that the blog is so active and people have something to say.
Chris - I did see Farscape from time to time.  Honestly, I forgot all about it when making my list.  I liked it fine, but got frustrated with SciFi's handling of it.  Current season this week.  First season next week.  Not on the following week.  For the record, I HATED the way it ended.  It actually seems that the producers were caught by surprise when it was cancelled, thus the 'to be continued'.
Enterprise - With the more serious overtones being set up for next season, does anyone think that we may be seeing the beginnings of the Empire instead of the Federation?
Ben - Your post struck a nerve, which surprises me.  While many of the articles/comics in the links you post piss me off to no end, I accept them as reflective of your views and not you trying to tell me how to act or think.  You don't necessarily share our passion (to strong a word but I can't think of a better one) for Buffy.  That is fine.  I don't get most of the song lyrics that are ocassionally posted here and have actually stopped reading them.  I don't complain about them being here, I just don't participate in the discussion about them.  While this group is small, it is diverse.  We all have things we like and don't like, things we will agree on and things we won't.  I like discussing things with other people, as I assume we all do or we wouldn't be posting here.  Please, let's not place restrictions on what we discuss.    I am not angry with you about your post, but it did pluck something.  I think JLS was correct in that if this discussion had been about B5, you would have been involved, but someone else who did not share your passion for it might not.
my thoughts and wishes are with angie today.
I watched the last episode of Buffy.  I'm pissed, too, Angie!  Faith schlupped some other dude!   (sniffle...)  Some one hold me...

You awake with an upset stomach in bed with Pat Buchanan.
what would happen if you took the blue pill and the red pill at the same time?   awareness without action?   action without thought?
yes, harmony, you will be.  actually you were - remember?  it was june 19th, 2000 and you were leaving to get some ice cream when a villian held you in his clutches until you started crying. i think you were relieved to be freed but still a tad bit embarrassed.
I wonder if I will ever be in a villain's clutches.
CK - Since I am purchasing the B5 DVDs as they are released, I do not need the VHS tapes anymore.  Feel free to make use of or otherwise dispose of them.  Most of my remaining B5 tapes have been fragmented or deleted; perhaps you will buy a DVD player soon?  They're awfully cheap.  Meanwhile:  JOIN US AT SHORE LEAVE!  That is all.
I'm sure that if the blog existed when B5 was on the air -- or Twin Peaks, before that -- there would be just as many commentaries, questions, and complaints.  Good shows with rich universes inspire deep and broad passions.
i was starting to seriously consider setting up a second 'buffy blog' for you guys - but then i realized that if i did, this blog would be empty until the series was over.  what a tsunami of discussion that show brought about!
The only discrepancy in the whole article that troubled me was Bush's insistence that he initially watched it on television, if the evidence shows he did not.  All politicians create a reality for us -- a necessity for all leaders, the fictionalizing of the public self -- and any thinking person can easily see through the smoke.  However, it disturbs me when the smoke is this obvious -- not because it reflects badly on the politician (who is doing what all leaders must do), but because it reveals an alarming assumption of the simple-mindedness of the public.  If the article is factual on this point, I would have preferred if Bush had said he heard about it through an aide, or that it was confusing and no one clearly knew what was going on, than to create a story about watching it on television.  If true, it is a silly and unnecessary lie.  Beyond that one point, the rest of the article kind of rolled over me as a sea of timestamps and vague outrage.  Conspiracy?  No.  Confused and silly humans?  Sure.  Unnecessary fictionalizing?  You bet.
I agree with Johnathan about the stupidity of his being robbed of choice in the end.  Read  urlLink my blog  for more of my thoughts.  I'm honestly too upset to think about it right now.  I know that's stupid because it's just a farkin' TV show, but I get this way about characters in books as well...I just get completely emotionally involved in them, and their tragedies devastate me.  I'm far too empathetic for my own good.
I was wondering how you were doing today Angie.  Did Spike and Buffy hook up in that last night?  To me, they kind of left that to our imagination.
Ben - I read some of the article and skimmed other parts.  It takes a little longer than 15 minutes to read it all.  I cannot believe that the author(s) is harping over 'discrepancies' of 2-3 minutes on some of these events.  If you take a room full of 30 people and ask then waht time it is, I can almost guarantee that you will get answers that vary plus or minus five minutes from each other.  As far as the opening statement that he knew we were under attack at 8:48, I strongly disagree.  It is very easy to sit here a year and half removed from the attacks and state what we know to be true now.  At 8:48, all anyone knew is that 1 aircraft had crashed into WTC.  At least 1, possibly 2, other aircraft were out of radio contact and were not transmitting on their transponders.  It could have been coincidence (a terrible accident and electrical failures on the planes).  I would not be surprised if the message, as it was passed up from ATC to other people (SS and NORAD), that they insisted on confirmation before taking any drastic action.  That obviously changed when the second plane hit.  As for why Cheney was immediately scooted out of the White House and Bush was not out of the school, think for a minute.  If you were flying over DC (which was difficult before 9/11 and impossible now), you would very easily be able to locate the White House, Capitol, monuments, and other known land marks.  I bet that if you were flying over Richmond, a city you know well, you would have a hard time locating specific non-descript buildings like a school.  Now think about a terrorist, with only basic flying abilities and limited knowledge of the target area.  They would have an extremely difficult time locating the school.  Bush was as safe as he could be at the school.  No plane was going to crash into the school.  The White House was a very likely target.  Cheney was in more immediate danger than Bush.  As for the differences in the accounts by various people, does that really need explaining?  Different people, different priorities, different personalities, different memories.  I don't know who or what this group is, but they sound almost as bad as the French author that tried to say we attacked the Pentagon with a missile.  There is no conspiracy here.  The CIA did not kill JFK.  FDR did not have advanced notice of Pearl Harbor.  Aliens did not crash in Roswell (ok, I might not believe that one).  Monica Lewinski was not a plant by the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy.  The US Navy did not shoot down TWA 800.  Did I miss any?
Spike is dead and I'm having a shit day. Thanks for playing!
I agree with some of your points, and disagree with others.  Thanks for the dialogue.
as far as all the potential slayers becoming slayers  at the same time, i don't think that was heavy-handed or took away from the message of personal empowerment. one of the purposes for buffy in the first place was to create a powerful female character who was also human and had human foibles and desires.  buffy was not so much someone beyond us as she was someone who despite all of her powers and responsibilites was so much like us. and, i believe, one of the messages of the series was that we (women), in one way or another,  are all potential slayers - we all have untapped powers that we just need to realize and cultivate.  and as faith herself as shown, just because you are female does not mean you will be 'good' if given the power of a slayer.  faith did turn back to the good side but not before a long, difficult struggle.   now it can be argued that there was no real male empowerment going on - i personally think men have more than enough rolemodels for that already.  and the men in buffy were strong - even spike who sacrificed himself for the love of a woman who he knew would never truly love him back.  such an archetypal theme -- the pain that is borne from unrequited love.   and i agree that the angel part was nice but contrived.  however, the line about her 'cookieness' was worth it.
I enjoyed Buffy's solution, and a few of the exchanges.  Beyond that:  One of the ubervamps nearly killed Buffy; now Andrew, Anya, Wood, Giles, and Xander can take out a few.  Angel arrived to deliver an amulet that did...what, exactly?  Talk about easy fixes.  Good thing Angel set up that second line of defense...where, exactly?  If it was daylight, couldn't they have knocked down the walls so the ubervamps couldn't get out of the hole?  Easy fix, part 2: the scythe.  Please.  Never mentioned before, never fully explained, and looked like a prop for some Klingon blood feud.  And let's introduce Buffy's greatest threat towards the end of the season, with no backstory, no explanation -- she just needs something to hit.  And let's invent a Big Bad that can be any dead person, and *not* have it appear as Tara at any time, or, in the last moment, appear as her mother -- wouldn't *that* have been more morale-defeating?  And throughout the enTIRE series it has been proven that crosses repel vampires, yet not *one* person brings a cross into the *Hellmouth*.  As for Kennedy and Willow, the writers assumed I would care, without making any effort to sell it.  And finally, Spike, who the writers have worked *very* hard to sell to me, sacrifices himself not in a personal, character-driven way, but by wearing an unexplained amulet that robs him of choice -- he never knew what it did, or the consequences, until the last moment, so instead of making a journey from A to B, he suddenly finds himself at B, and figures, what the hell, might as well.  That's not sacrifice, that's circumstance.  I *much* preferred Anya's sudden death in battle.  A senseless death should be a senseless death, not a slapped-together oh-lookout-I-guess-I'm-sacrificing-myself-oh-well death.  Either write a character-driven sacrifice based on clear, high-stakes choice, or let the character simply die in battle.  Meanwhile -- I enjoyed the funny moments, I enjoyed Angel's initial appearance (though he disappeared as yet another casualty in the writer-painted-in-a-corner situation), and I *thoroughly* enjoyed Buffy's solution, though I question the wisdom of ending the series with such a world-changing event -- who is going to teach all these girls?  I predict that, being human, the majority will turn out to be chaotic and dangerous.  But of course, we know they won't, because we all know that if women were given such power, surely they wouldn't do the baaaad things men do, because women are inherently *good* creatures!  Take that, evil evil men!  I am sorely disappointed that the story, which was so effective at creating a metaphor and myth for personal empowerment, ended on such a simplistic, heavy-handed note.  The show remains as important to me as Twin Peaks or B5.  I will enjoy it for many years.  But beyond season 5, it was notable only for select episodes or isolated moments.  To its credit, those select episodes and isolated moments were better than most of the television out there at the time, and that's a high compliment indeed.  Sometime, watch the whole arc of season 3 with the mayor, or season 5 with Glory.  Then watch season 7, and note how it skips and sputters to the end.  It could have been, should have been, so much more.
so you did or did not like the finale, harmony?   i loved it.  and yeah, how is spike going to show up on angel?  he is so completely dead. the worst death for me was anya.  i had felt like i related to her more than any other character in the buffyverse.
oh yeah, i laughed so hard - they were playing d&d and making a homestar runner reference.  it was heaven. :)
yelahneb - read the article.  Interesting.  Took much longer than 15 minutes.  Either you have superhuman reading powers or you suffer from the same time confusion described in the story. ;-)
Why is it so hard to create a movie or television episode that gives me more than a few really good moments?  Why are writers so lazy that they expect me to fill in the blanks?  Why do writers receive so much notoriety not for being very careful and attentive to the story, but for succeeding in climbing awkwardly out of the corner into which they have painted themselves?  Always, always, always leave the party when everyone is having a good time.
Ok, so of my list of fatalities, I got one and a half right - Spike and Anya.  I had Anya on the 50/50 list, thus only half credit.  How the heck is Spike going to appear on Angel?  He is very dead (i.e. dust)  Did you guys catch the Trogdor Burninator reference?  I thought the ending was to anticlimatic.
urlLink 9.11.2001   group: if you can, please set aside 15 minutes or so to give this one a read, and post your feedback; it's a summary of Bush's actions and whereabouts (and those of others) on 9/11.  many questions...
OK, peeps, catching up on the blog (and I didn't have to go  all  the way to the bottom of the 100 post view!)  JS -- I realized tonight that I still have your video tape with Season 3 of B5 (Angie's Journey caused the lightbulb to fizzle on). Need it back? For that matter, does anyone have 4 and 5 on tape? And, yes, I still need VHS, as I have discovered myself to be a rather late-adopter when it comes to home electronics....  Did anyone here ever watch Farscape on SciFi? I noticed that it didn't make John's list - did you just miss it or didn't like it?  BTW, I really like hanging out with you guys as a group, albeit virtually, since this particular collection of minds can easily switch from discussing the inherent unfairness of international power politics vis a vis the individual all the way over to the intricacies of the universe created for 'Buffy: The Vampire Slayer.' It brings a tear to my eye [sniff].
that was incredible.
10 minutes until the end of buffyverse.
3 hours, 45 minutes to the end of Buffy.
Meanwhile:   urlLink where's tank?
why threat level orange?   i thought it was threat level tangerine.
Threat level orange!  Threat level orange!
It's not new.  For example, my Government teacher in high school referred to little-d democrats and big-d democrats, as well as little-r republicans and big-r republicans.  Usually the terms distinguish between the theory and the party.  It has never occurred to me to apply actual rules to their use.  I try to distinguish between upper- and lower-case in both text and conversation when I feel the need.  In general, the common popular usages are almost universally in reference to a party, even when the speaker claims otherwise, so it's not worth inquiring further.  If, in conversation, I claim simply to be a republican, and the listener hears 'party,' that is generally his or her problem, not mine.  One might as well carry around a pre-made disclaimer to be read every time one says 'god.'  More to the point, to most people I have observed, the distinction is insignificant or irrelevant.  I feel most politically-minded people became so because of issues rather than theory.  Theory usually comes later, and is grafted to become inseparable from the issues.  Postscript:  To be fair, the term 'little-d democratic' is far more frequent than 'little-r republican,' because 'democratic' is such a commonly used term to define a method of decision-making.  Because no one thinks much about how this country is arguably a republic, or why it was designed as one, and because of the cultural saturation of our political parties, it's almost pointless to attempt a distinction between republican/Republican in casual company.  Since (R)epublican has such a universally illustrative meaning, why bother with such a minor quibble as capitalization?  And so it goes.
i just checked the mirror and you harmony the june bug are correct!
I thought it was an octality theory.
i'm probably becoming fascinated by minutia here, but the 'upper / lower case' labeling interests me.  now that you've created a definition for the terms, will they only be used in emails and other text-based exchanges of ideas?  in conversation, no one will be able to hear the distinction between the two; would you come up with different terms for your beliefs to use when you were speaking to someone, or would you explain which type of r/Republican you were each time?  if in that same conversation (or another), if the person you were talking to said 'i'm a d/Democrat', would you ask them what sort of d/Democrat they were, or would you just make an assumption?  since you mentioned that this is a new thing, it's cool if you don't know the answers to these questions yet - i was just curious.
i feel it coming upon me - like ivy creeping up the walls of harvard, like mold growing on the walls of a public bathroom, like litter flaking slowly from a cat's paw - it's dinner party time again! time - first weekend of august - (first saturday) place - mekong who's invited - everybody! everybody!
i suppose in some ways i'm a sucker for ben's chaos/order duality theory.  (as one could have guessed by looking at my lower back) i find myself thinking that i am a representative of chaos - a jemmy for this world.  and god, yes, i actually believe that is flaky.
I agree -- illustrating extremes is an effective way to reveal the uncertain middle.  A good point indeed.
i agree that there are no absolutes and none should be attempted.  however, the purpose of these types of discussions can be to point out the black and white merely so the majority can discover that there are areas of gray.   in order to have a balance you must have both sides argued.
Two cents:  wrong and evil, and for that matter right and good, are not the same thing.  Also:  of the final examples, I feel rape is the stronger of the two.  Murder is a sub-category of ending a life, and requires more clarification to be both relevant and effective.  A minor distinction, but an important one for your larger argument.  As to the issue of suffering needlessly, I am generally curious:  at what point does the suffering become needless?  For that matter, when is suffering needful?  Is suffering validated by the beauty or wisdom that comes from it?  If one person suffers from a disease and draws on that suffering to compose a heartrending symphony and then dies, while another without such talent stares out a dirty window until he or she suffers the same fate, unknown and unheard -- were both experiences equally needless?  What of the many who will be touched by and grow from hearing the symphony?  For that matter, what of the son or daughter of the other individual, who, having watched the loved one die, dedicates him- or herself to raising a stronger and more loved family than might have been possible before?  Does that person's suffering suddenly become needful?  I raise such questions not because I favor generally institutionalized suffering -- surely not -- but I am reluctant to dispense with suffering altogether by labeling it as needless, without understanding where the line is drawn, beyond the usual extreme examples.  I feel that only by defining one's terms can one be assured of success in any discourse.  Once again, my issue is with absolutes.  I am wary of them.  They occur nowhere in the universe except the human imagination, and I have yet personally to see one single absolute that applies in infinite cases at infinite times.
i'm going to the bahamas!  pajamas!
in response: i am aware of the difference between the upper and lower case 'republican' and 'democrat.'  i ignore them merely out of laziness not aesthetics but thanks for the benefit of the doubt - i am in this discourse referring to the concept  of the republican and democratic parties. and i would absolutely agree with harmony's statement that many people are beneficiaries of our lack of social darwinism in this country and are fairly unaware of it.  not many of us would survive in a truly competitive society.  and those who do believe it, in my opinion, are not only insensitive elitists but also sadists.  to ignore one group's suffering or difficulties because they do not match or compliment the most dominant or successful group is disgusting.  we can judge ourselves by how we treat the lowest of our society - i would think a vegan of all people would understand that.   however, when i hear people speak of the ethical dilemna faced by genetic counseling, i do not see the issue.  if someone can be spared the pain of illness or an impariment than let it be.  yes, yes, we get into the whole concept of how a society decides what is aberrant but really, when do we start discussing the realities of people's lives?  in my own case, as many of you know, have suffered from clinical depression for most of my life - i now take medication to control it.  if this could have been prevented before i was born, would i have approved?  you are damn right.  my depression did not build my character - it stripped away years of happiness from me and no one should have that burden placed upon them even if some intellectuals seem to want to make the world suffer in order to satisfy some form of philosophy. and neb, your questions about who runs what are just questions of policy.  what a country would we be living in if only education was taken that seriously! and yes, neb, i know you think life is a cycle but all we can do is try to do what is best - and yes, that is subjective not only to each culture but to each individual but we all have to start realizing some things are wrong.  murder is wrong.  rape is wrong.  letting people suffer needlessly is wrong.
r/R, d/D:  The subject is a bit cumbersome for blog posting.  But I will try, by presenting a series of possibly unfair oversimplifications.  As a republican, I focus on the realistic application of the political philosophy, while ignoring all specific issues.  (R)epublicans (and (D)emocrats) usually unite political philosophy and social engineering.  As I use the terms, to be (r)epublican or (d)emocrat is to place a template, a patterned design, atop an ever-moving and ever-changing society.  (r)s and (d)s don't particularly mind what that constantly-moving society believes or wants or fears, as long the overlaying template is there to best realize its desires.  The overlaying template or design exists not as a restriction, but as the best possible expediter of the society's desires.  For example, I believe ideas best flow up, from local to national.  To enforce this empowers, challenges, educates, and generally lights a fire in the populace.  I don't particularly care what the ideas are, as long as they push upward from the grass.  This is exciting and involving.  A democrat might believe that ideas best flow down, from national to local.  Such a path has the valid benefit of increased speed and less effort.  But for various reasons, I generally reject it despite its strengths.  In general, I perceive (R)epublicans and (D)emocrats as starting from this point, but then grafting onto this foundation a superfluous catalog of issues, agendas, and ideologies.  Also, (R)s and (D)s usually strike me as absolutist, which is not to my taste.  I am not entirely pleased with the words I've chosen or the presentation of my ideas, but I felt it only fair to respond to your inquiry.  Most of these ideas and opinions are only recently formed, and are not ready for prime time, so to speak.  But here is a flawed attempt at communicating them, just the same.
I have observed that Social Darwinists are often ignorant of the interdependencies that got them where they are.  Self reliance is equal parts reality and illusion.
JLS - i've not heard of the difference between 'upper-' and 'lower-case' democracts and republicans.  enlighten us...
part of the difficulty one faces with bringing such arguments to certain republican mindsets:   *sometimes*, you're dealing with social darwinists, who believe that only the strong will (and should) survive.  as they see it, the species, and society, is only as strong as its weakest link; ergo, if you continue to coddle the poorest and weakest elements of the population, they will only continue to breed more poor and weak persons.  evolution has proven time and again that when a given species fails to act or become as strong or stronger than their competitors, they soon go the route of extinction.  mind you, this is a rather extreme point of view, and i seriously doubt that anyone who subscribed to it would come right out and confirm this (at least, in political circles).  there are plenty of milder versions of this philsophy out there - and more extreme ones.  eugenics was committed to the idea that, ultimately, we should set a standard for the human race in regards to intelligence, strength and attractiveness, and eliminate any member of the population who did not meet the minimum requirements established by this standard - or at least discourage if not prevent those same members from producing offspring.  this sort of thing is done all the time to other species by farmers and their ilk; why not on our own race, some have asked.  involuntary sterilization of institutionalized mentally retarded persons continued in virginia until about the seventies or so, i believe.  it does raise some interesting questions about the short term sacrifice, long term gain strategy that miriam spoke of; if via genetics, we could eliminate all disease, physical and mental disability, etc. from the human race via the systematic use of genetic manipulation prior and during each and every human conception, why shouldn't we, for the betterment of our species?  this assumes that the genetics in question were tried and true, and took into account the need to allow for some diversity in order to prevent the human race from being wiped out in one pass by a new, never before seen disease.  as for education of and for all youth, i'm all for it - but who's in charge of creating the curriculum?  should it be creatively or technically driven?  should it be paid for on a county, state or nationwide basis, or some combination thereof?  should teachers or parents have more control and responsibility for children's behavior?  should we offer the benefits of education only to citizens of our country, or to those of others as well?    as for 'the social contract which dictates that that we provide the best services we can for each member of society because that's just the ethical thing to do', it certainly sounds like a good and benevolent concept; the problem with those social contracts is that nobody has to sign them.    in the end, the policies and procedures of the nation (and the world, to a degree) are decided by rich men in high towers, as it has been for thousands of years.  there is a revolution every now and again, and occasionally the men in question are dragged out and shot; but the towers remain, and eventually, someone takes up residence once again.  without them, there can be no true order; with them, there can be no real freedom.
I was with you until the last sentence.  It seems to me that ethical systems belong in the private sphere, not the public one.  In general, institutions make lousy ethicists.  Further, I feel the weak link of the sentence is the term 'best services.'  It is impossible for more than one human to agree on what that entails in all cases.  Also, the term 'social contract' makes me uncomfortable.  I have signed no such contract.  Finally, for the record, while I appreciate your aesthetic choice to use only lower-case, it can have unfortunate results.  For example, I consider myself a republican -- lower-case -- not a Republican, upper-case.  As with democratic and Democratic, there are subtle, yet important differences between the two.  As for the text preceding that sentence, I hope the tide turns in favor of those with this condition.  If the resources are available, and the public agrees on the necessary trade-offs, perhaps one day it will come to pass.
to bring up a topic that was introduced yesterday during game -  you need to have  good educational system in order to form a peaceful and strong society.  republicans overall don't seem to understand the concept of short term sacrifices for long term goals.  for instance - something close to my own life - autistic children.  there is a program in place which can actually 'cure' up to 60 percent of all children with autism.  the price of this treatment ranges from free in some states (california) to 55,000 dollars per student in others (virginia)  the conservatives in this state go no we can't put more money into special education!  we don't have the budget!  but what they don't realize or seem to realize is that if they invest the money now they can save money on special education for the rest of the students' lives (the treatment generally takes 2-3 years), not have to pay for special services as they get older - this will actually save money in the long run!!!  and also, don't we have a social contract which dictates that we provide the best services we can for each member of society because that's just the ethical thing to do?

american association of law schools will not permit a school to join which  discrimates against homosexuals during the job-interview process which is a very important part of the law school experience for the students.
'I noted in an earlier opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which any reputable law school must seek to belong) excludes from membership any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview facilities a law firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective partner a person who openly engages in homosexual conduct.'  Ummm...what? Too many wordy negatives in that statement.  I got lost somewhere around 'refuses to ban.'  Can someone translate that for me?
Harmony is right.  The movie industry, by and large, is hella lame.  We are fortunate that so many good films slip through the cracks and still get made and sometimes seen and acknowledged.  But mostly it's an LCD money machine.  Poo.

Justice Scalia's (who may be chief justice soon) opinion on the same case: June 27, 2003  |  Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct. I noted in an earlier opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which any reputable law school must seek to belong) excludes from membership any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview facilities a law firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective partner a person who openly engages in homosexual conduct.   One of the most revealing statements in today's opinion is the Court's grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is 'an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.' It is clear from this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children's schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive. The Court views it as 'discrimination' which it is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued is the Court with the law profession's anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that culture are not obviously 'mainstream'; that in most States what the Court calls 'discrimination' against those who engage in homosexual acts is perfectly legal; that proposals to ban such 'discrimination' under Title VII have repeatedly been rejected by Congress; that in some cases such 'discrimination' is mandated by federal statute (see 10 U.S.C. 654(b)(1) mandating discharge from the armed forces of any service member who engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts); and that in some cases such 'discrimination' is a constitutional right.      Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means. Social perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and every group has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is the best. That homosexuals have achieved some success in that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the few remaining States that criminalize private, consensual homosexual acts. But persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one's views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I would no more require a State to criminalize homosexual acts -- or, for that matter, display any moral disapprobation of them -- than I would forbid it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a brand-new 'constitutional right' by a Court that is impatient of democratic change. It is indeed true that 'later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress'; and when that happens, later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the premise of our system that those judgments are to be made by the people, and not imposed by a governing caste that knows best.   One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the people rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need not carry things to their logical conclusion. The people may feel that their disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow homosexual marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private homosexual acts -- and may legislate accordingly. The Court today pretends that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so that we need not fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage, as has recently occurred in Canada (in a decision that the Canadian Government has chosen not to appeal). At the end of its opinion -- after having laid waste the foundations of our rational-basis jurisprudence -- the Court says that the present case 'does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.' Do not believe it. More illuminating than this bald, unreasoned disclaimer is the progression of thought displayed by an earlier passage in the Court's opinion, which notes the constitutional protections afforded to 'personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education,' and then declares that '[p]ersons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.' (emphasis added). Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned. If moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is 'no legitimate state interest' for purposes of proscribing that conduct; and if, as the Court coos (casting aside all pretense of neutrality), '[w]hen sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring'; what justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples exercising '[t]he liberty protected by the Constitution?' Surely not the encouragement of procreation, since the sterile and the elderly are allowed to marry. This case 'does not involve' the issue of homosexual marriage only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court. Many will hope that, as the Court comfortingly assures us, this is so.   The matters appropriate for this Court's resolution are only three: Texas's prohibition of sodomy neither infringes a 'fundamental right' (which the Court does not dispute), nor is unsupported by a rational relation to what the Constitution considers a legitimate state interest, nor denies the equal protection of the laws. I dissent.
Nevermind.  I just read about it on CNN.  That's really cool.  I'm often ignorant of current events, mainly because most cable news networks make want to shoot myself, as do their websites.  I like NPR, but sometimes their voices are so soothing that I fall asleep listening to it.
I mean, I like what the guy said, and his actual words made perfect sense, but what's it's context?  I have no information about the case to which this pertains.  Inform me, for I am ignorant!
Ummm....what?  Where did this come from and what does it all mean, man???????
Following are excerpts from Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Lawrence vs. Texas, handed down June 26.  Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions ...  It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in Bowers was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These considerations do not answer the question before us, however. The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law. 'Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.' [Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, (1992)] ...  The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual. Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District is reversed.
from  urlLink Penny Arcade :   I decided right away that I wanted to be a bounty hunter, and so with blaster in hand I began working my way up that particular skill tree. This involved a lot of shooting of rats, bugs and crabs.   At one point on Tatooine, I was standing next to a mission terminal waiting for my turn to use it when I saw a large wookie run past me, firing wildly over his shoulder as a tiny crab no bigger than a dinner plate chased him through town. How sad, I thought to myself. I spent countless hours wandering the hillsides in search of new rats and crabs to shoot. Sometimes I would inadvertently stumble upon too large a rat and be forced to high tail it back to town. I placed my character in 'auto run' and pointed him at the nearest town.   As I sat there staring at my Trandoshan bounding across the uneven Tatooine landscape with some kind of super rat closing in on him, I thought to myself, This is not how I want to play in the Star Wars Universe.

Yelahneb - neither the most current version of IE for Mac nor Mac's own new browser, Safari, display Blogger normally.  As I suspected, Blogger programmers are favoring the most recent Windows-based browser coding.  While Mac IE has no problem with any other site I visit, I acknowledge it always lags a version behind what appears on Windows; as for Safari, it is a robust and capable browser, more recent than the latest Windows IE, yet it cannot display Blogger either.  No big deal; I just have to click a few more places than everyone else.  It only reveals the deficiencies of the immature and inexperienced Blogger engineers.

Partially based on misinformation.  The part about him treating his people badly and having lots of oil still holds true.  What I want to know is, if the WMD thing craps out, but it's ultimately ok because he was a cruel man and now the terrorists have one less country from which to operate, can we move on and invade and occupy other countries with cruel leaders and ample land for terrorist hideaways?  Or is oil the only remaining prerequisite for us to provide this service?  Wouldn't it be funny if, upon invading Iraq, we had found no WMD, *and* the country had now run out of oil.  If the *only* reason left was the liberation(?) of the Iraqi people.  I wonder what the pro-war side would say then.  If they would gladly invade other countries, to gain *only* the liberation(?) of the populace.  Personally, I certainly hope WMD are found.  I'm ashamed enough of this administration's arrogant, bullying, cowboy, cartoon behavior -- what a fiasco if it wasn't even warranted.  Well, except for the part about the liberation(?) of the people, and the hidden terrorists in the hills.  Oh, wait -- and the oil.  Yeah.  I keep forgetting about that.

Free will always results in loss of control.  Every choice further limits your options.

If it helps, red, I was put here to test you.
thanks for your insight angie.  and the tattoo had two distinct meanings for me when it was done.   one is not so important now (okay, hell, it was ben -  back to our regularly scheduled conversation) and the other being my desire to have clarity, balance, and moderation in my life - sometimes i feel close to being there and other times it's like i haven't moved an inch for years.    there are no answers to be discovered but a path that each individual can follow - each path is as different as each individual is.  but we can learn from others in their journeys - from their terrain.
red - perhaps you could start by thinking about the design on your back.  It seems to have been important enough to have it permanently tattooed on your body.  Unless your interpretation of its meaning applies to something completely different.
That's oen of the reasons why I believe in God...'cause I feel like too much happens that seems to be meant for the enlightenment of myself and others.  I know there are many people close to me who, like me, would not be the unique and thoughtful individuals they are today if not for some of the trials they endured and subsequently learned from.    Personally, I have worked toward getting my intellect and emotion on par through lots and lots of therapy.  Therapy really helps me to make the connection between those two facets of myself, and helps me to see the enlightenment I can obtain through my painful experiences, instead of just wallowing in the so-called cosmic injustice.  I could say that all the emotional battery I endured from my peers growing up was unfair, unjust, wrong, and nothing but bruises and scars on my psyche.  But somehow my downward spiral to the bottom of my emotional barrel showed me that I can go up, that if I want to keep living, I have no CHOICE but to go up.  And my intellectual side has made that upward journey a lot easier.  It's wonderful when you start to transform your pain and anger into joy.  It's not always easy, but damn it feels good when you get there.  I may not be able to do it every day, but I'm getting better and better the more I practice.  And it makes appreciating the simple yet immense joys of life and love so much easier and necessary.  I spend a good portion of my day in a state of humility and gratitude for my past pains, becaue I honestly believe that I would not know the joy I know today without them.    And having been to the bottom and back, when you come out on the other side, suddenly your priorities are so much more clear.  Losing everything emotionally helps you so much to realize what's truly important to you, if you allow yourself to reflect on the loss with more of a sense of evaluation and new perspective than in anger and resentment for having had to lose everything in the first place.  I slip sometimes, especially when I'm hormonal, so that's why I continue to go to therapy...because it keeps me in check about what's really important, especially when I start to fret about silly incidental things like my weight and my daily stress at work, things that at first seem overwhelming, but, in the big picture, are nearly meaningless.  The truly important things in my life seem to have a way of working themselves out.    I don't know if I came even remotely close to answering your question, but these are the thoughts that came out of my head when I read your post, so I hope you enjoy them. :)
really, do you ever feel like there are people or situations in the world that exist to test you?  i know that claims alot of ego because that would mean that somewhere in the universe someone or something is concerned about your individual enlightenment - but it does seem that way sometimes.
i suppose my question is then how do we get the two to harmonize?
Unless emotion and intellect are in harmony, it is unlikely one knows at all.
why is it we can know something so firmly and completely intellectually but still be unable to comprehend it emotionally?
For that matter, one could say all ideologies are absolutist.
Cameron Frye was the legendary best friend of Ferris.    'When Cameron was in Egypt's land,  Let my Cameron gooooooo!'  God, he kicked so much ass.    But yeah, he did one Trek movie, so he's set to do the convention circuit for life.  And he was there this year.  And I met him.  And my life will never be the same.  I am a changed woman.  Because I met Alan 'Cameron Frye' Ruck.  Among other famous people.  But I will post all about that on my LJ in due time, just as soon as I quit cruisin' down the Lortab Highway.
Mir, my dear...liberals are also absolutistic.  (Though you probably mean absolutist.)

Distortion of Evidence  The President took the nation to war based on his assertion that Iraq posed an imminent threat to our country. Now the evidence that backed that assertion is falling apart. Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq in the 1990s and a supporter of the war, recently wrote, 'Clearly a decision had been taken to pump up the case against Iraq.'  If the Bush administration distorted intelligence or knowingly used false data to support the call to war, it would be an unprecedented deception. With a crisis of credibility brewing abroad and the integrity of our President and our foreign policy on the line, we need answers now.  Please ask Congress to establish an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the distortion of evidence right now. If Bush and his officials deceived the American public to create support for the Iraq war, they need to be held accountable.

from salon's cary tennis: Do not fear change. It is better to try to achieve something good than it is to try to avoid something bad. Both paths have risks, but only one can lead to happiness. So do not simply coast along thinking maybe this is as good as it gets. This is not as good as it gets. It gets much better than this. You need only the courage to act. Take strength in knowing you have come a long way and you are doing the right thing.

Q. In a recent Answer Man, you stated Johnny Depp based his character in 'Pirates of the Caribbean' on Keith Richards. While this is true, he also based his character on one more influence: Pepe Le Pew, the skunk from Looney Tunes. Depp says...   'Yeah, I kind of incorporated the idea of Keith. Not like an imitation of Keith or anything but just that wisdom that he carries, that sort of confidence that he has, that attack that he has. So I got that on one side and on the other side I took a little bit of this cartoon character that I've always loved when I was a kid, his name was Pepe Le Pew. Yeah, the skunk. He smelled horrible, but was absolutely convinced that he was the ultimate ladies' man. You know the guy, he'd fall in love with this cat and the cat quite clearly despised him but Pepe Le Pew sort of read it as, 'Oh, she's just playing hard to get. Oh, she's just shy.' '  Sean Leslie,  Salt Lake City, Utah   A. Now that it's been pointed out, I can see the resemblance. And to think I said he was merely channeling a drunken drag queen. That's why actors get the big bucks.
Q:  I've noticed an interesting trend over the last few years: You can sometimes tell who the 'bad guys' are in a movie or TV show by what computer they use. For instance, on '24,' all the bad guys used PCs while the good guys all used Macs. The same holds true for 'Austin Powers,' 'Legally Blonde,' etc. Why do you think Apple always gets the plumb roles? I'm of the opinion that Hollywood loves the underdog and has a close relationship with Apple computer, whereas PCs seem controlled by a megalomaniac in Seattle. Are there a lot more Mac zealots like me in Hollywood? Does Apple pour sponsorship money in big-budget studio movies?  Justin Toomey, Athens, Ohio  Ebert:  Since many Windows machines look alike, Apple is one of the few manufacturers that can gain by product placement, which accounts for some of the Macs. It's true that the movie industry and creative types in general prefer the Mac. The novelist Tom Clancy sends e-mails with this signature line: 'Never ask a man what computer he uses. If it's a Mac, he'll tell you. If it's not, why embarrass him?'

Usually as the format of the text suggests.  As in:  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  *shrug*  That kind of means, 'This is what I'm saying, and after saying it, I'm shrugging, most likely in real life as I type it.'   Out of curiosity, why is this so important to you?  I never really gave it much thought before now.   And Tree, I had originally typed the phrase phonetically, but I thought Ben wouldn't know what I was talking about, so I went with the actual spelling of the words so as not to confuse anyone.  Johnny Depp is a fine example of anything, I agree.
ok, i think i understand your definition of the 'shrug' - but what about the timing aspect that i mentioned?  is the shrug occuring within the post, or a moment later, as the format of the text suggests?
Umm, as a New Yorker, I must make an alternate orthographical suggestion: 'fuhggedaboudit.'  But I heartily second the use of Johnny Depp as example. For anything.
life is sweet! life is awesome, baby child.
Ben -  watch 'Donnie Brasco,' specifically the scene where Johnny Depp explains the meaning of 'forget about it' to a coworker.  It's sorta like that.
queer eye is coming on tonight!
Perhaps the network is attempting to scare away Republicans, who might be afraid that their TV will give them cooties -- or worse, that they might be caught watching the wrong thing when Jesus returns in all His glory to separate the straight wheat from the queer chaff.
benji can you hear me?  benji can you shrug me? hey, a question for everyone, what is your favorite woody allen film? mine would be manhattan.
hey angie - a netlanguage question for you.    when you write '*shrugs*' at the end of your posts, what emotion or action are you suggesting?  is it an 'i don't know',  an 'it's weird, but what can you do?', or is it simply meant to suggest the body language of shrugging, its meaning left for the 'viewer' to determine?  for that matter, is it meant to overlay the flow of the entire post, or not until after you're done 'speaking'?  in other words, should i imagine the 'shrug' amidst the text, or not until after?  the format suggests the latter, but i'm open to ambiguity here.
ahhhhhh!!! my site is malfunctioning again!  must wait around for it to straigten itself out. watermelon time.
Christine Todd Whitman sold her soul to the republican party.  it was rumored that she resigned from the epa because of the dearth of information regarding global warning in the epa report.   however, she came out on npr saying she wanted to spend 'more time with her family.' but that she was considering a run for the nj senate.  so, it seems the republicans told her that if she kept her trap shut, they would back her for the senate.   i don't bravo is trying to be known as the 'gay' network - they are just going for shock value (with boy meets boy) and for advertisers (queer eye for the straight guy).   gay men have a lot of disposable income because normally they have no alimony or kids to deal with.
okay, harmony, what is the empathy?  am i feeling the love?
I don't know if it's Bravo's official stance to be the gay network, but they certainly are the snooty art snob network, which kind of lends itself to the whole gay thing.  *shrugs*
Two off the wall and totall non related questions for the off the wall and mostly non related people on this Blog  1)  Is Bravo known as a gay network?  (ala Lifetime for women and Spike for men).  I was flipping around the other day and saw that Bravo is showing reruns of the West Wing.  I saw adds for a couple of shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Boy Meets Boy, or something like that.  It just seemed odd to have two shows like that on one channel if they weren't trying to be known for it.  2)  What happened to Christine Todd Whitman?  I heard something about the Senate confirming a new head of the EPA last week.  Of course, Bush, in his infinite wisdom, pulled yet another Republican governor to fill the slot.  So much for the majority of the states being governed by Republicans.  I think half of them are now, or have been, on Bush's cabinet.
The empathy will be thafe onthe all the ambathadorth have left.
it actually bothered me when strong sad got hit by strong mad.  i'm getting worried about my empathy.

Meanwhile, headlines from MSNBC.com:   'Pedestrians swarm the streets ... In face of blackout, people cope'  Well, I should hope they cope.  What did they expect?  'In face of blackout, massacre ensues'?  Also wondering what it means, exactly, that pedestrians 'swarm the streets.'  Are they masses of chaotic, swirling dots?  Are they agitated and feeling strongly aggressive?  Are they gathering in larger and larger numbers, helplessly answering a primal drive?  Or perhaps someone threatened the Queen?
This kind of thing continues to bother me.  From darkhorizons:  '...the official site reports that Anakin apparently has a scar in the movie but he does not get it in the film, rather the event happens in one of the books preceeding the film.'  Okay, so now *another* book is canon?  What the hell?  Is this a movie or not?  Is it a movie about people whose further adventures are recorded by unnamed historians, or novels about people who occasionally get filmed by some omniscient documentarian?  If both the movie and the book are essentially the same thing, is the movie a better story because it was the one that got filmed, or rather does the book supply backstory that the movie couldn't manage, and if so, why not?  I understand this is just a marketing ploy, but it raises profound questions about the nature of narrative.  (Please note that I'm focusing on canonical texts that occur in the same world and timeline as a movie, or vice versa, *not* spin-offs of either medium that provide alternate adventures.)

A Citizen's Appeal to a General in a Time of War (at Home)   September 12, 2003      Dear General Wesley Clark,   I've been meaning to write to you for some time. Two days after the Oscars, when I felt very alone and somewhat frightened by the level of hatred toward me for daring to suggest that we were being led into war for 'fictitious reasons,' one person stuck his neck out and came to my defense on national television.    And that person was you.   Aaron Brown had just finished interviewing me by satellite on CNN, and I had made a crack about me being 'the only non-general allowed on CNN all week.' He ended the interview and then turned to you, as you were sitting at the desk with him. He asked you what you thought of this crazy guy, Michael Moore. And, although we were still in Week 1 of the war, you boldly said that my dissent was necessary and welcome, and you pointed out that I was against Bush and his 'policies,' not the kids in the service. I sat in Flint, Mich., with the earpiece still in my ear and I was floored -- a GENERAL standing up for me and, in effect, for all the millions who were opposed to the war but had been bullied into silence.   Since that night, I have spent a lot of time checking you out. And what I've learned about you corresponds to my experience with you back in March. You seem to be a man of integrity. You seem not afraid to speak the truth. I liked your answer when you were asked your position on gun control: 'If you are the type of person who likes assault weapons, there is a place for you -- the United States Army. We have them.'   In addition to being first in your class at West Point, a four-star general from Arkansas, and the former supreme commander of NATO -- enough right there that should give pause to any peace-loving person -- I have discovered that ...   1. You oppose the PATRIOT Act and would fight the expansion of its powers.   2. You are firmly pro-choice.   3. You filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action case.   4. You would get rid of the Bush tax 'cut' and make the rich pay their fair share.   5. You respect the views of our allies and want to work with them and with the rest of the international community.   6. And you oppose war. You have said that war should always be the 'last resort' and that it is military men such as yourself who are the most for peace because it is YOU and your soldiers who have to do the dying. You find something unsettling about a commander in chief who dons a flight suit and pretends to be Top Gun, a stunt that dishonored those who have died in that flight suit in the service of their country.   General Clark, last night I finally got to meet you in person. I would like to share with others what I said to you privately: You may be the person who can defeat George W. Bush in next year's election.   This is not an endorsement. For me, it's too early for that. I have liked Howard Dean (in spite of his flawed positions in support of some capital punishment, his grade 'A' rating from the NRA, and his opposition to cutting the Pentagon budget). And Dennis Kucinich is so committed to all the right stuff. We need candidates in this race who will say the things that need to be said, to push the pathetically lame Democratic Party into having a backbone -- or get out of the way and let us have a REAL second party on the ballot.   But right now, for the sake and survival of our very country, we need someone who is going to get the job done, period. And that job, no matter whom I speak to across America -- be they leftie Green or conservative Democrat, and even many disgusted Republicans -- EVERYONE is of one mind as to what that job is:   Bush must go.   This is war, General, and it's Bush & Co.'s war on us. It's their war on the middle class, the poor, the environment, their war on women and their war against anyone around the world who doesn't accept total American domination. Yes, it's a war -- and we, the people, need a general to beat back those who have abused our Constitution and our basic sense of decency.   The General vs. the Texas Air National Guard deserter! I want to see that debate, and I know who the winner is going to be.   The other night, when you were on Bill Maher's show, he began by reading to you a quote from Howard Dean where he (Dean) tried to run away from the word 'liberal.' Maher said to you, so, General, do you want to run away from that word? Without missing a beat, you said 'No!' and you reminded everyone that America was founded as a 'liberal democracy.' The audience went wild with applause.   That is what we have needed for a long time on our side -- guts. I am sure there are things you and I don't see eye to eye on, but now is the time for all good people from the far left to the middle of the road to bury the damn hatchet and get together behind someone who is not only good on the issues but can beat George W. Bush. And where I come from in the Midwest, General, I know you are the kind of candidate that the average American will vote for.   Michael Moore likes a general? I never thought I'd write these words. But desperate times call for desperate measures. I want to know more about you. I want your voice heard. I would like to see you in these debates. Then let the chips fall where they may -- and we'll all have a better idea of what to do. If you sit it out, then I think we all know what we are left with.   I am asking everyone I know to send an e-mail to you now to encourage you to run, even if they aren't sure they would vote for you. (Wesley Clark's e-mail address is: info@leadershipforamerica.org.) None of us truly know how we will vote five months from now or a year from now. But we do know that this race needs a jolt -- and Bush needs to know that there is one person he won't be able to Dukakisize.   Take the plunge, General Clark. At the very least, the nation needs to hear what you know about what was really behind this invasion of Iraq and your fresh ideas of how we can live in a more peaceful world. Yes, your country needs you to perform one more act of brave service -- to help defeat an enemy from within, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, an address that used to belong to 'we, the people.'   Yours,   Michael Moore Lottery # 275, U.S. military draft, 1972 Conscientious Objector applicant mmflint@aol.com

Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly, but when  they lit a fire in the craft, it sank - proving once  and for all that you can't have your kayak and heat  it, too.   Two boll weevils grew up in South Carolina. One went  to Hollywood and became a famous actor. The other  stayed behind in the cotton fields and never amounted  to much. The second one, naturally, became known as  the lesser of two weevils.   A three-legged dog walks into a saloon in the Old  West. He sidles up to the bar and announces: 'I'm  looking for the man who shot my paw.'   This guy goes into a restaurant for a Christmas  breakfast while in his home town for the holidays.  After looking over the menu he says, 'I'll just have  the eggs Benedict.' His order comes a while later and  it's served on a big, shiny hubcap. He asks the  waiter, 'What's with the hubcap?' The waiter sings,  'O, there's no plate like chrome for the hollandaise!'    When she told me I was average, she was just being  mean.   A neutron goes into a bar and asks the bartender, 'How  much for a beer?' The bartender replies, 'For you, no  charge.'   Two atoms are walking down the street and they run  into each other. One says to the other, 'Are you all  right?' 'No, I lost an electron!' 'Are you sure?'  'Yeah, I'm positive!'   Did you hear about the Buddhist who refused his  dentist's Novocain during root canal work? He wanted  transcenddental medication.   A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and  were standing in the lobby discussing their recent  tournament victories. After about an hour, the manager  came out of the office and asked them to disperse.  'But why?,' they asked as they moved off. 'Because,'  he said, 'I can't stand chess nuts boasting in an open  foyer.'   A hungry lion was roaming through the jungle looking  for something to eat. He came across two men. One was  sitting under a tree and reading a book; the other was  typing away on his typewriter. The lion quickly  pounced on the man reading the book and devoured him.  Even the king of the jungle knows that readers digest  and writers cramp.   There was a man who entered a local paper's pun  contest. He sent in ten different puns, in the hope  that at least one of the puns would win.  Unfortunately, no pun in ten did.   A guy goes to a psychiatrist. 'Doc, I keep having  these alternating recurring dreams. First I'm a  teepee; then I'm a wigwam; then I'm a teepee; then I'm  a wigwam. It's driving me crazy. What's wrong with  me?' The doctor replies: 'It's very simple. You're two  tents.'   A woman has twins and gives them up for adoption. One  of them goes to a family in Egypt and is named 'Amal.'  The other goes to a family in Spain; they name him  'Juan.' Years later, Juan sends a picture of himself  to his mom. Upon receiving the picture, she tells her  husband that she wishes she also had a picture of  Amal. Her husband responds, 'But they are twins -- if  you've seen Juan, you've seen Amal.'
i'm up for some decent halloweening.
who's up for a decent halloween party this year?  as in, costumes and music and food and such.  all hallows eve falls on a friday...  besides the items mir mentioned, i get my protein from peanuts and beans.  tofu comes in so very many forms - some that most wouldn't recognize taste-wise.  tofu in its plain form is just gross!   but it can be marinated, cooked, scrambled, spiced, what have you into almost any tasty foodstuff.
i would suggest that you give her fake meat which can be found in the frozen food section of ukrops - they have bocca burgers, fake chicken nuggets,fake chicken patties -  i'm guessing she will like those also, there are 'smart dogs' which are fake hotdogs - plenty of protein there - and actually, cheese is a really good source of protein.
My daughter is 3 1/2 years old.  She is almost a vegetarian.  The only meat she will eat is chicken, and that is only sometimes.  She drinks lots of milk (24-30 oz a day).  For comparrison, most doctors recommend that growing teenagers get about that same amount.  She also usually will eat cheese when it is offered, and she eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch.  Most of her calories are coming from bread, fruit, and vegetables.    My questions is this, how do vegetarians get the protein they need?  I know that soy (tofu) is a good source, but I really doubt she will eat it.  I only eat it when it is in hot & sour soup, so I also would have no idea how to offer it to her.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

One, a fanciful retelling of the Guy Fawkes story set in a postapocalyptic Britain, is  an adaptation of V for Vendetta, the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd.  The other, Plastic Man, is based on the old DC Comics character. Plastic Man has long been rumored to be the Wachowskis' next film, but, of course, there's no official word.'  read the full article  urlLink here .   oddly enough, Matrix 3 premieres on November 5 - Guy Fawkes Day.
An excerpt from Ebert's review of the revival of 'Eyes Without a Face'...  *****  '....One of the tasks faced by serious filmgoers is to distinguish good films in disreputable genres. It is insufferable to claim you 'never' see horror movies (or Westerns, musicals, war movies, teenage romances or slasher pictures). You're presenting ignorance as taste.  The trick is to find the good ones. The French auteur critics did a lot of helpful spadework, resurrecting genres and rehabilitating reputations, but they were not always right -- and besides, you have to feel it for yourself. If a film holds my attention, it is in one way or another a good one. If it moves or delights me, it may be great. If I am distracted by its conventions, obligatory scenes and carelessness or lack of ambition, it deserves to be tossed back into the genre.'
I am not upgrading to Panther; neither of my computers are G4s.  The pre-Panther version of OSX works well enough, but not zippy, on my two G3s.  Reluctant to advance further without G4 hardware.  But thanks for the tip.  Rarely is any technology ready for prime time in the first weeks of release.

In many cases, all the data the drive stores are also gone.  The glitch is particularly troubling because many Mac users backed up their files to an external FireWire drive before installing the Panther upgrade.

an article about the  urlLink Urban Light Works , an art 'happening' being held downtown on halloween night (and the following night) at the canal basin.   i'm more intrigued by it now; sounds like they've expanded it from last year.
I read the rest of them too.  I never had an Atari to know about the suckiness that was apparently ET.  Space Invaders was ok, Galaxian was better, but Galaga rules.  And don't get me going on their reaction to Mario.  Those little punks need to be taught how to respect their elders.  What was the crack about all the developers of Space Invaders being dead?
I had the same though when I read it.
That sounds awfully close to Galaxy Quest.  Which was also probably done before, in some story somewhere.  So I guess it doesn't matter.  But still.  Regardless, I guess this is what happens when there are no out-of-work-actor guest-star shows like Murder She Wrote on the air.

For those looking for something intense:  the Scream Forest way out on Staples Mill is quite disturbing.  They really went all out.  Carnival games, bonfire, wagon ride to the trail, lots of lights and effects in the woods.  I was scared.  Recommend thinking twice about entering the house at the end -- in the middle it is pitch black in an enclosed space with no reference point, and if you're prone to claustrophobia or are afraid of buried alive, etc., take the 'Chicken Trail' that goes around it.  I would not recommend the attraction to anyone under 8 years old.  Includes graphic stuff, like an automated body, bag over its head, moaning and writhing from where it is suspended by its feet in the trees.

You do?  Jesus, that's probably what's making you kill people...  I wondered how you spent your Tuesday nights when I wasn't around...and that would explain the smell of blood in the house...  I liked dating about 56% of the time when I was dating...I really loved the newness when it was good...I hated the awkwardness when it was bad.  Glad I met my soulmate when I did, because I was biologically getting really tired of field playing.  Nesting instincts starting to kick in and all that...
Every third Tuesday I watch 4 hours of WB sitcoms as penance.  It seems a fair trade.
oh man, i thought you had finally stopped being psychotic, harmony.  i thought the bodies would stop piling up, the screams of horror would end - but it never will , my fiend?
My reward in dating was always the sweet sound of the screams when -- oh -- sorry.  I...er...now this is awkward...look, nachos!
not saying, of course, that marriage is bad - it's not when the right people get married -  but the consequences and rewards are much higher in marriage than in dating.
i think you are either dating someone or married - each term has its own definition and connotations.  if i tell you,  hi, here's billy bob, my date for the evening-   you are thinking, well billy bob sucks but she still has a chance to get out of it.  if i tell you, here's billy bob, my husband  - you are thinking, well she's fucked. big difference.
Yes, but then when you go home after the date, well...there they are.
Well, you could practice both at the same time...... Provided that the one you are dating is the one you are married to as well.
I enjoy both dating and being married.  Though I do not recommend practicing both concurrently.
Dating, huh? Well.... I had some spectacularly boring dates with self-involved actors earlier this summer. I was recently abandoned by a drunk first date (thank goodness). But I've also had some positive experiences. I'd say that dating is both what you make it and always an adventure. And as someone who has been on both sides of single & married, I'd have to say that I'm currently enjoying the dating gambit. If you ask me again in six months I may change my mind....

The other person? I know I am fairly silent, but to be forgotten? Shame on you! ;-) Then again that is perhaps my problem..... I do not make enough impression on a person.   Don't know if dating is like swimming through a black abyss. I have comapred it to the the Every Flavor Jelly bean in the Harry Potter book. Don't know what you will end up with and you can get one that leaves a bad taste. I had few like that.
i just had a single friend tell me that trying to date is like swimming in some giant black abyss.  i haven't really had a lot of single time in my life - when i was, it was for the most part by choice, (not meaning i was the dumper but once i had been dumped i wanted to stay single or blah, blah,) but is it really that horrible?   let's hear from our single bloggers!  like jennifer and jason and the other person!

Ireland and Scotland have been really fucking awesome, but in the tradition of all of my vacations, I drank way too damn much.  I think I'm going to need a few weeks of detoxing after this one.  The weather has been atrocious.  While we were in Edinburgh last week, it was raining so hard that our umbrella snapped in half.  As Nick said, you kind of understand why the Scots are so surly when God personally tells you to fuck off.  It was like he was saying, 'Go home Mary Poppins!'  Dublin is a fairly unattractive city, but the people here are amazing cool.  It's the first place in Europe that I've been to where the majority of people actually liked Americans, with the exception of the 'fat ones who come here and wear green.'  We went to the Guiness brewery and out on a pub crawl.  Nick has been doing gigs almost every night, so we've spent a lot of time hanging out with Irish comics.  The people love him here.

Castillion was rescued during the collapse by unnamed friends, and is now alive and well in the Ethereal.  The party talked with him in the office of Din Dal Kut, who resides on a splinter plane.  It seems that when Thulos took Terranel, the 'local group' of the multiverse was torn away with it, and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the in-between-place.  A side result of this occurence is that, according to Castillion, the dead have nowhere to go, and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia.  Castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods, if possible.  He has recommened that the party join forces with the Harpers, a secret society formed by the last Elven bard at the very end of the Great Retreat.  Upon seeing Calleum and the banner of Heironeous in a magical viewing painting/frame on Din Dal Kut's office wall, Burne leapt to join his mentor, and was last seen in a battle in Rashemen, one of the lands that borders the Far East.  The act broke the portal, and the party was unable to follow.  Also, Castillon is Ian's father.  Having reached the end of the original journey, Ian and Gregory are beginning to question if they should continue, or return to Tilverton to tell of Castillion's demise -- which was Castillion's request, as the truth would be too difficult to understand.  Players have the option of sending their character off to do something long-term, and create and play a new character.  The world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such.  Once the false murder rap is resolved, the party may see the Breaking of the original Fellowship -- but the beginning of a much larger, world-spanning epic.

i heard a bit about this story - was this kid at any point a threat to anyone?  did he have the box cutter for a reason?   does anybody really believe that the passengers/flight attendants wouldn't beat the hell out of anyone who threatened them with a box cutter?   it seems to be that safety is not insured by constant surveillance and encroachment of civil liberties and common sense but rather by public policy which promotes equality and fairness among peoples and countries.   no matter how many middle eastern countries we bomb into oblivion (iran seems next) we cannot make them agree with western philosophy, capitalism, christianity, or as the u.s. government is claiming, democracy.    and also didn't bush say during the presidential election that he did not want us to be nation-builders -i suppose he was correct - we destroy afghanistan and then we leave it to rot - we go to war against iraq and then have no follow-up plan -  we are not nation builders - we are nation destroyers - the bullies of the world.
So -- we now occupy Iraq, yet a kid can slip box cutters onto an airplane.  Can someone reassure me that we're safer now than we were two years ago?

Hey John!  It's weird to hear that you didn't think that people in the UK care about US politics.  The article that Ben put up was from the  Independent  and it is one of the most reputable and widespread newpapers here.  That story was on the front page.  People in Europe generally know more about US politics than Americans do, since our decisions seem to greatly affect them.  People here are terrified that George Bush is going to get elected again and when they hear things like that story, they get even more nervous.  They blame Bush for dragging them into a war that they don't want to be in.  The protest against the invasion of Iraq in London last February was the largest public demonstration that has ever occured in England.  Tony Blair completely ignored the consensus of the people, which led to his lovely nickname, 'Bush's Bitch'.  Due to Blair's alliance with the US concerning the occupation of Iraq, the Labour party might lose its power in the up-coming elections.  The Liberal Democrats have already gained alot of seats in Parliment and polls show that they will most likely gain many more.  America is a super power and right now Bush's shitty foreign diplomacy skills have angered people all over the world and caused them to rally against us.  Now the papers are saying that the US is giving Iran a deadline to prove that it doesn't have nuclear weapons.  Sound familiar?  That worked so well last time.  How that hell can you prove that you don't have something?  Any way, the majority of people here are intensely hoping that Bush will get voted out soon.  English media is typically very well researched.  The newspapers here were the first to release reports on the how Bush stole the Florida election.  Okay...just realized that I'm rambling, so I'm going to stop myself there.    On to fun things.  Nick, my boy here, is coming to the US for Christmas!  Yay.  Isn't that exciting?  He might be performing at that new comedy club in Richmond, but his agent is still working that out.  Miriam, hope you realize that you're hanging out with me when I get home, cause you have to meet him.  Okay.  That's all.
yep, mir = rocktober.
ooyeah/Happy Roctober = Miriam?  Anyway, just got back from my world domination meeting.....err, company staff meeting.  The thermal imaging thing is basically a double check to make sure that there are not more votes recorded on the computer's memory card than were actually cast.  It does it by having heat sensors that detect the heat from your fingers as you touch the screen.  The problem that I don't understand is how do you keep that number from being messed with?  Then again, I am not a computer software exper.  As for Franken, I ignore him just as I do Bill O'Reilly.  Thinking about, the reason they hate each other so much is that they are just alike except for the extreme opposition of their political views.  As for Rush, I am currently in a phase of not listening to him, but it will be interesting to see what happens when he comes back from rehab.  Never having had back problems (knocking on every piece of wood I can find), I can't imagine the pain that people must go through to become addicted to Oxicontin.
take that back!  oven mitts are nice creatures. they love us.
You know what else is reprehensible?  Oven mitts.
john, you are so funny.  :)  even though i don't completely understand what you meant about the raw data and the thermal imaging - science and such is not my thing so if someone could explain that for the scientifically illiterate, i would appreciate it. and for all of you people out there who hate the left, you'll be pleased to know that ben and i should be starting up our show again sometime in the next few months!  and one of our main objectives of this program is to get whomever is running against bush elected.  i mean we just hate bush.   anyway, not all conservatives are bad -  heck, my parents are republicans.  and i do feel very sorry for rush - it's horrible for him and his family that he would have such a awful addiction.  i do dislike al franken more after hearing reports of what he said.  if he disagrees with rush on ideas, policy, etc, that is one thing but to celebrate when another fellow human being is suffering is reprehensible.
Ben - Honestly I did not read the entire article.  When I started seeing where it was going with the tone of it being a Republican/republican conspiracy AND saw that I was maybe a third of the way through, I did stop reading.  I tried to be clear that I was not attcking Ben Haley directly with my thoughts on the response to the 2000 elections by saying the collective you.  I used your name just to make sure you saw it, since you posted the original article.  I apolgize for the force of my reposne, but it set me off yesterday.  I get a little tired of the 'corporations are evil' and 'corporations have the Republicans in their pockets' attitudes.  Assuming for a moment that the second is true (which I do not agree with since most corporations grease the palms of just about any politician, regardless of party affiliation, to make sure they have access to power brokers),  a corporation is going to do what it can to make sure it stays profitable.  To assist with that, they need to be able to influence politicians.  It is generally easier to influence someone to you point of view if they are already close to it to begin with.  Conservitives tend to favor less taxes and less government than liberals.  This fact automatically puts the corporations more towards the conservatives.  The voting machines/software/hardware have to be made by someone.  The entities that can most easily do it are corporations.  Let's say for a second that a bunch of hackers got together and made some apparently good software.  Should the software be mistrusted because the hackers tend to be less concerned with laws of society?  Not if it works.  Now, the whole restriction on who can review the raw data, uh-uh, that is bogus.  I can see making the non-corporate personnel signing a non-disclosure agreement about whatever they see in the guts of the machine, but the integrity of the system has to come first.  And not using the full capabilities of the software (thermal imaging to keep track of what part of the screen was touched), why bother having it if you are not going to use it.  My main umbrage was the implied tone of the article that Republicans are pulling all these strings behind the scenes and that we are all evil bastards complicit in the grand conspiracy to make sure we are in control.  I initially thought you sneaked a Salon.com article by me.  I was a little shocked to see that someone in the UK would be that interested in our politics.  Again, Ben, I apologize if you thought my response was directly aimed at you.  I can see why you would think that (since I did use your name in my first sentence), but it really was not.  Now, if you will please excuse me while I attend my weekly strategy meeting for keeping the masses under control....
The truth of the matter is, moths are not from our world:  among their kind there are tales of a faraway place of happiness and belonging -- a home to which they can return only through a legendary portal that hides deep within the center of flame.  None may know which flame holds the gateway; but that does not deter many moth-dreamers who plunge bravely into flame after flame, hoping that this light will not bring scorching heat and painful death, but instant passage to a land of eternal dusk filled with tiny flittering wings and a million joyful hearts.
the moth don't care if the flame is real.

iTunes and iPod work together to make a powerful, seamless, elegant music management system.  As for the store, I've visited it only once.  However, if it occurs to me to get a song, I would rather pay .99 for it than download it for free.  I've just never felt comfortable getting free music.  Can't explain why.  Regardless, I love both the app and the device.  The store is for me only a side item.
In other news: Apple launches iTunes for Windows. Visit apple.com for details.   ok, i'll bite - is anyone else in this group planning to buy songs from the apple site rather than just continue to download them for free from the p2p networks?  c'mon, i know all of you have stolen your share of mp3s at this point; why stop now?  the only users getting targetted by the RIAA are the ones sharing out the huge catalogs of songs.  as innovative as this apple thing may appear, i'm hoping it's just a beta test for what's to come; namely: artists over the next few years allowing their contracts with the record companies to run out, and then start selling their music directly to the net from their own sites.  now, *that's* the sort of music i would pay for - my $ would go straight to the band, not some musical megacorp that pushes us to buy overpriced crap product designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator.

Seen on a discussion board:  MICROSOFT: Where do you want to go today?  APPLE: Where do you want to go tomorrow?  LINUX: Are you coming or what?
Have at you, dead horse:  yelahneb -- if the iPod topic interests you, click  urlLink here  for an ongoing discussion board.  There is a link below the news item (as of this posting it read '74 comments) -- several pages of discussion.  I use it mainly at work or connected to a stereo at home, so it's usually plugged into an outlet anyway.  So as a user I may not be comparable to the campus-roaming users who rely on the battery daily for months on end.
JLS: no you don't.  you hate your iPod, and when the battery dies, so dies all hope.  shrug all you wish; it will not save you.
don't worry about yel, harmony, he's been pretty grouchy lately.

All batteries eventually die. The iPod battery is quite replaceable; various vendors are available online. You can do it yourself, or Apple can do it for you. Battery life, of course, depends on individual use. Owners of the original generation of iPods are doing fine on the boards.   i just got off the phone with a representative at Apple.  here's the story: up until literally a  week  ago (!), anyone whose internal iPod battery died had to pay (at the very least)  $250.00  to have the unit serviced, regardless of what was wrong with it; which, of course, is almost as much as buying a new one (they run about 3, 4 and 5 hundred dollars each, depending on the GB).  as you might have guessed, consumers weren't too happy with the cost, so Apple finally relented (as i said, just about 7 days ago), and began offering a 'battery exchange program' for those whose iPod batteries died.  the cost of this service is  $99.00, plus shipping and handling .  to have your battery replaced, you are required to  mail your iPod back to the company , and they may send a replacement unit back instead of your original, depending on their workload.  the nationwide Apple stores cannot replace your battery, and according to the company, neither can the owner; the internal battery is  not  being offered for individual sale by Apple.  a second option is to purchase Apple's 'iPod Protection Plan' for  $59.00 .  this will cover battery replacement for up to 2 years, but you must still send the iPod back to Apple for the same aforementioned service.  after the 2 years of the plan are up, you're back to the $99.00 charge for battery replacement.   despite the company's assertions to the contrary, however, there  is  a non-Apple site that you can buy a replacement iPod internal battery from:  urlLink iPodbattery.com , for about $50 apiece.  they even include online instructions on how to install it, for the  urlLink old  and  urlLink new  models.   average life span of the iPod's internal battery, according to Apple:  1 year with heavy use, 2 years with light use.    it's a brilliant marketing scheme; charge the consumer 3 to 5 hundred dollars for your initial product, and then another hundred bucks every 1-2 years after to keep it running.    i gotta admire them for their chutzpah at the very least, especially with the competition undercutting them by about 50 bucks.  perhaps they figure that the average consumer either won't know any better, or will be unwilling to install the battery themselves...?
I thought Nick's post was clear and well stated.  As for my agreement regarding his take on the protest -- well, yes, I agree it was his take, since it was his protest, not mine, and those were his reasons.  They seemed valid grievances to me.  I don't really have a response to his suggestions, except they sounded like valid options for debate.  And yes, there certainly are many things that can be done now -- that was my point.  I was just wondering what others thought those should be, as most of what I hear in various media amounts to complaints rather than solutions.  As for handing Iraq over to the UN -- sounds to me like a swift Islamic Fundamentalist state in the making.  Which is what it wants to be, anyway.  All choices being equal, an uninformed populace will take the path of least resistance.  Either the UN's bureaucratic incompetence will set up a fast-track to that result, or the US will spend lots of money, resources, time, and lives on delaying it as long as possible.  The choice, in my layman's opinion, seems not in the destination, which appears predetermined to me, but rather in the journey that gets us there.  Note that I do not consider this fate permanent.  It is merely this generation's path of least resistance.  Revolutionary change takes generations to ripen.  Until then, a populace will suffer any inhumanity in exchange for bread on the shelves and trains that run on time.

JLS: in regards to the protests against Bush's visit to England, you said:    'A shame that 200,000 people organized themselves only to express anger.  Such honest effort and energy expended to no end other than brief catharsis.'   Nick responded to your conclusions.  What did you think of his response?  Do you agree with his take on the protest?    OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'. I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.   It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clamp-down on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.   It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year. As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.    You also said:   'I will repeat the question: What should be done *now*?   Nick responded to this as well: he addressed concerns that people have from many countries, including the US, in regards to Bush's policies in Iraq; it is safe to say that any or all of these issues could and should be addressed immediately.  What is your response to this?  Beyond his list, aren't there a great many other things that can be done now, from changing our tactics in Iraq to overhauling our foreign policy in the middle east overall?    'Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.'    Also, your posts regarding different 'what do i do with  this  flag?' scenarios were clever and hilarious; it helped point out the absurdity of the whole notion that you can make it illegal to burn or otherwise destroy a symbol, which by its very definition cannot truly be destroyed anyway.  Because IT'S A SYMBOL, damnit, NOT the tangible thing that it represents!

And now, a little bit of  urlLink this  and a  little bit of  urlLink that
My point is not that the Ten Commandments are old, but rather that they were traditionally authored by Yahweh, the god of the Hebrews in the Old Testament, and to refer to them as a starting point in our legal theory is to make inseperable our society's laws and the aforementioned deity.  Such a link would be quite alarming to citizens who do not worship that particular god.  Unlike many other countries, America is not a nation of culture, religion, or kin.  It is a land of immigrants, regardless of who got here first.  Any attempt to establish a connection to a single, unifying religious tradition immediately excludes hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others, and immediately weakens what I consider one of my country's strengths.  The history of human thought is rich and vast, and is more than capable of providing all the justification necessary to hold a society, or a nation, together.  I see no need to choose one artifact from one religion to serve as a back-up for already existing laws.  It is every family's right to display that artifact -- any artifact -- in its own home, or, alternatively, in any private gathering place.  Such an artifact can inspire as much or as little thought or dialogue as the private individual sees fit.  But to place it in a government courthouse suggests, to me, that our laws and the god of the Old Testament are inexorably connected.  And I just can't find a compelling historical, philosophical, or, for that matter, religious reason that it must be so.  Note:  My argument is focusing on the suggested *connection*; I do not feel the judge in question was directly prohibiting the exercise of any particular religion.  Though I doubt he'd mind very much.
Nick - I'm not ignoring your post or your points, but I need sometime to make sure that my response is a cogent as your post.  I don't agree with much of it, but it was a very good post.  Time to get back to the grindstone.
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.  My non-legal interpretation  It says Congress can't do it.  Somewhere along the way that got put on the states as well (note that I am not proposing that states should be allowed to).  Displaying an item in a public place is not making a law.  Keep in mind that the writer's of the Bill of Rights had fresh memory of English rule where the Anglican Church was the government endorsed religion.  I don't know what, if any, penalties were involved with practicing a different type of Christianity (or judaism or even worse, considering the English history with the Crusades, islam) or being an atheist.  Perhaps Nick could shed some light on it?  The part that always seems to be forgotten is where is says 'or prohibiting the free excercise thereof.'  Going down the path we are heading, churches on major thoroughfares may not be allowed to display their crosses or Christmas nativities because it can be seen from a public street and might be interpreted as the government endorsing a religion by having a road travel right by the church?  Ridiculous?  Yes.  But stranger things have happened - remember the woman who spilled hot coffee on herself and won millions of dollars from McDonald's in a lawsuit?  Once the courts get involved, just about anything can happen.
I was pretty sure that you were, but I wanted to see what was written about the subject.  I was surprised to see that we had a US Flag Code as part of the actual US Code of Laws.  Note that all of those items are  shoulds  not  musts or wills .
Johnathan - In one of your responses concerning the Ten Commandements, you stated (correctly) that you are not a 13th century BCE Hebrew, implying to me that you did not think that something proposed 3,300 years ago has no place in today's society because we have changed over time.  I submit to you that we are not 4th century BCE Greeks, therefore the notion of the Republican form of government proposed by Plato (or at least written about by Plato) has no place in today's society.  I may have my information incorrect on Plato, as I don't remember much ancient history, but the specifics are not that important to my point.  Just because a concept is old does not mean it does not have modern relevance.  Where do you draw the line?  3,000 years - there goes the Ten Commandments 2,000 years - there goes the Republican form of government 1,000 years - there goes the Magna Carta 500 years - I can't think of anything except for the discovery the New World. 200 years - there goes the US Constitution 100 years - there go workers/consumers rights (labor unions / Sherman Anti-Trust laws)
Thanks for the post.  I was indeed jesting, but was curious regardless.  I found this part fascinating:  'The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing.'
Does anyone know if the actor Steven Culp is the son of Robert Culp?  He currently has three recurring roles on three different shows on three different networks (Clayton Webb on JAG; the Speaker of the House on the West Wing; the MACO major on Enterprise).  I have seen him various parts over the past few years, but I am beginning to notice that he looks a little like Robert Culp.
In somewhat of an answer to your question Johnathan (in case it was a serious question)  176. Respect for flag No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.  (a) The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.  (b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.  (c) The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.  (d) The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general.  (e) The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.  (f) The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.  (g) The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.  (h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.  (i) The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.  (j) No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.  (k) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning  I do not think the Code has been modified to account for stickers and magnets.  Note that the prefered way is through burning, just not in protest.  I know that many VFW and Foreign Legion Posts hold ceremnonies each year to dispose of flags and that these do involve burning the flag during a somber ceremony.
Self observation:  How curious, that when I am talking with my fellow citizens, I tend to doubt key elements of my government's foreign policy; yet when I encounter someone from another country who voices similar opinions, I bristle, and feel compelled to defend it.  Regardless, thanks for sharing.
Then Santa will come, after all?  God bless us, every one!

I liked the idea of that as an offence - maybe that could've been a way out of being burned as a witch.  As a non-American blogger I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I'd better say something.  Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts.  The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.   Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't  a priori  represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.  The flag may represent freedom to you, but that doesn't mean freedom is affected by burning it, any more than terror, torture, coersion and death vanish when it's burned by someone to whom it represents those things.  It follows that you can't just argue against flag-burning by ascribing some meaning to the flag and saying that the flag-burner must dissapprove of this meaning.    ' by doing so [burning the flag], they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead. The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot .'    Couldn't they be saying just about anything about the US?  Maybe they don't like the choice of milkshakes available there.  It's a little unfair to assume that it's the  positive  things they don't like.  And if they're  really  free to do it, why does taking advantage of that freedom in fact imply any protest at all?  By that logic, having gay sex is a protest against a country that grants the freedom to indulge in it.  I'm sure no-one would say, 'by having gay sex, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead - the lifestyle that allows them to have gay sex without being arrested or shot.' (This might be a bad example to anyone reading in Georgia*) That said, I think there are tactical reasons, as a protestor, to avoid burning flags - be they the Stars'n'Stripes, the Union Jack, the Tricolore or the Star of David - unless you're a citizen of the country that flag represents.  Unless your point really is 'I hate all Americans/British/French/Jews', in any of which cases I'd really rather not be marching alongside you, that's the message you're going to put across to people in that country.   I was pleased to note, on the march against Bush, that almost every banner and speaker was careful to differentiate between GWB and the population he claims to represent.  I would have felt uncomfortable if someone had burned an American flag, because of the indiscriminate message that would put across to people watching in the US (Yeah, like it made the headlines).  I have zero sentimental or political attachment to my country's flag, but I still feel if I see it burned overseas that I probably wouldn't be welcome at that particular party (unless it's one of those 'Hindus For The Abolition of Primary Colors' demonstrations - those guys are alright).  OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'.  I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.  It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clampdown on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.  It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year.  As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.  Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.  Er, I'd better go.  *or, Eva informs me, Virginia. Damn it, that's another Christmas tradition that I'll have to miss this year.
john - i don't think the issue here is whether our laws have a judeo-christian origin or not.  nor do i think that conservatives are desperate to educate the masses regarding common law.  it is the intent, john, that is the problem. by having the ten commandments displayed, it is promoting a particular religion - that being christianity - if you saw a copy of a section of the koran everwhere, you could believe that religion was being promoted.   the u.s. government is not supposed to endorse any religion -
One can only hope that the debunking from AICN towards the bottom of this posting is true.  My apologies in advance for the lengthy copy/paste.  From Dark Horizons:  ******  ...We've heard about Lucas yet again making changes to the original trilogy to update it. Til now most of the rumours have been about adding additional elements like more in regards to Alderaan before its destruction and so on. The gossip reached fever pitch earlier today over the Internet but now it seems the whole fiasco has been defused. Here's the story.  First up the rumours that emerged over at The Digital Bits yesterday:  'These changes include new special effects, revised and updated shots and scenes, and new footage shot with actors Hayden Christensen (Anakin) and Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) that would flesh out moments with their characters in the original films. For example, an aged and scarred Hayden now appears as Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi when Luke removes Vader's helmet.   Among the other changes reportedly being made are the restoration of the original 'Han shoots first' moment from Star Wars and a revamped lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan and Vader. What we've heard meshes with what we've been told before, which is that Lucas has always planned to release ultimate, 'Archive' editions of these films that tie in better with the new prequels.   The main question in our minds now is this: will these changes be completed in time to appear on the DVD releases planned for next September, or will we have to wait until after Episode III hits theaters to see them? And if we have to wait, what versions will appear on the DVDs? Time will tell'.  That wasn't the only site with talk of it. TheForce.Net posted an extensive list of all the apparent rumoured changes in order for the original trilogy - 22 for 'A New Hope', 10 for 'Empire' and 14 for 'Jedi'. Amongst musical cue differences and improved lightsaber and spaceship effects there's some big changes here:  'A New Hope' - A new scene which has been shot during the filming of Episode III in which the Emperor dissolves the Senate.  - The bleeding arm on the floor in the Cantina has been replaced with a non-bleeding arm because it's now canon that lightsabers cauterize wounds  - The original Han/Greedo shooting scene has been restored  - When the Death Star destroys Alderaan there's a new scene of Yoda's reaction to the disturbance in the Force that is created by all those deaths and then it cuts to Obi-Wan reacting to it as well  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for use with all the stormtroopers  - The Obi-Wan/Vader duel has been spruced up. It is much more epic and there is much more movement. A modified version of Duel of the Fates is being considered for the scene  - There's a new scene (shot during Episode III) where Darth Vader goes to Coruscant and lands his ship in the same building Count Dooku does at the end of Attack of the Clones. Except now the building is all fixed up and it is now Palpatine's palace. He meets with Palpatine to ask for forgiveness for his failure and inform him of a new potential who is strong in the Force  'Empire Strikes Back' - Tom-Toms are now CG, the Hoth battle is much more extensive.  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for the older Boba Fett and all the stormtroopers  - Ian McDiarmid has refilmed scenes as the Emperor. The conversations between Vader and Palpatine is now longer and features a few connections to the prequels  - Yoda's face is now animated in CG allowing more expression of emotions yet his movements remain the same. Also two deleted scenes featuring Yoda instructing Luke have been restored  - A new scene was shot in which the stormtroopers, after they capture Han, Leia and Chewie, bring Vader the box containing C-3PO in pieces. Vader orders the stormtroopers to bring the broken droid to Chewbacca's cell so that he can fix him  'Return of the Jedi' - Jabba, Yoda & the Ewoks are now mostly CG.   - In the battle of Endor there are thousands of Ewoks and they are more vicious than there midgets-in-suits counterparts. More bite the dust now.  - Palpatine's face has gotten a CG lift, the black blotches removed  - Sebastion Shaw who played Anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with Hayden Christenson in make-up to make him look older. Anakin has much more dialogue. He apologizes for the destruction he caused, he thanks his son for turning him back to the light, he tells his son to rebuild the Jedi and he says he loves him and his sister. Just before he dies he says, 'It is finished...'.  - We see more planets celebrating at the end of the movie. We see an aged Jar Jar, who is now the leader of the Gungans, on Naboo celebrating with the people of Naboo and the Gungans. We see an old Watto, who is now unable to fly, sitting in a hover chair cheering on Tatooine. During these scenes Across the Stars plays transitioning to the victory celebration music at the Ewok tree village.  - Anakin's spirit is now played by Hayden Christenson with make-up to make him look his age. He looks on proudly at his son Luke with the spirit of Padme by his side  The full list can be found here, there's also talk that 'Episode I' will also get a revamp of some sort.  Just a few hours ago though, another site has weighed in - none other than AICN who calls the whole thing an utter fabrication. Here's ' Moriarty':  'I'm going to have to call this one out as being total nonsense. This exact word for word list ran as a talkback by a guy named 'Donnie Darko' several weeks ago, and that's not the first time I've seen it show up. Yes, Lucas is working on Archival Editions of the films, despite his continued denial of it in public, like at a UCLA appearance this week. Yes, there are some dramatic things they're trying. But this fanboy wish list is just not true. And the films that are coming out on DVD next fall are the Special Editions you've seen already. The ones released in '97. No changes. Nothing done to them'
I have flag sticker in my cube that was left behind by the previous occupant.  Can someone recommend the appropriate way to dispose of this sticker, should I decide to remove it?  Please note that I would be removing the sticker merely for aesthetic reasons, and not in any kind of protest.
The Ten Commandments are the product of a 13th century BCE religion and culture, regardless of the message, and to place them on government property suggests that we should accept the deity Yahweh, or Jehovah, as our single, original source of law.  As for what is wrong with telling people not to kill, to respect their parents, etc.: nothing.  But what is curious is the need to enhance the already strong argument with the physical presence of the Ten Commandments, which, if one is to take them as merely wise suggestions rather than the direct prescriptives of Yahweh, have no more weight than what anyone else recommends anyway.  The only way that words gain weight, or importance, beyond their inherent meaning, is in either how they are used, or who uses them.  The Ten Commandments, traditionally, come directly from Yahweh through Moses.  Take away that connection, and they have no more weight than any other wisdom.  Are our society's laws so dodgy that we need to back them up with a direct line to the Creator of the universe?  My goodness, but that's an alarming prospect.
Yeah, but then you would have laws passed against attempted flag burning and impersonating a flag  (TIC)
Johnathan - Who said anything about a theocracy?  Would the commandments be better accepted if the one about honor no other God before me (or something to that effect) was not listed?  What is wrong with telling people to not kill one another, respect their parents, don't steal, don't bear false witness against your neighbor, and don't cover your neighbor's possessions?  I seem to recall that most states have laws against taking another's life (except for the State itself with capital punishment).  Of course, if people did not kill others, then the need for capital punishment would be greatly reduced.  Any, the principles expressed in the commandments sound like pretty good fundamentals to live by to me, and totally non-religious in nature if you ignore where they supposedly came from.    Eva - My point with the statues is what point was toppling a statue of Bush supposed to prove?  I really doubt that anyone in the US will be convinced not to vote for Bush because the people in another country don't like him.  Anyone who considers the actions of the protestors in deciding not to vote for Bush will probably have already decided not to based on many other factors.  As for France and Germany, why would they care if you toppled statues or burned their leaders in effigy?  I'm sure 90%+ of their citizens could care less what we in the US think of their leaders.  All I'm saying is that the reverse is true.  (P.S. Thanks for the trivia information on French Fries.  Don't blame me for someone way back thinking that Flemish Fries did not have the same ring.)  If the British don't like the way their PM is buddying up to the US/Bush, then they should do whatever is necessary under the procedures of Parliament to bring down the government.  If the British Parliament is anything like Israel's or Italy's procedurally, then it should not be difficult.  The British protesting our President accomplishes nothing productive.  We are not going to impeach our President because he is unpopular in England.  The last time I checked, we won a war 222 years ago so that we would not have to take orders from them.  Ben - I don't quite understand the difference between how you typed the one sentence (Free speech just does not apply...) compared to what I typed.  To me they say the same thing.  Then again, my degree is in engineering not english.  The point I was trying to make was regardless of the standard that is set for the definition of free speech, it must be applied universally to the socially acceptable topics (Civil rights) and the socially unacceptable topics (white supremacy).  Burning things in peoples yards (i.e. burning a cross in a black family's yard) is not freedom of speech, but a form of intimidation (and probably terrorism under the Patriot Act).  But, a bunch of guys in a farmer's field, with his permission, burning a cross and spouting their hate speech must be accepted as freedom of speech IF we are going to say that burning the flag is.  If a law is passed to make burning the flag illegal, then doing so is no longer a question social acceptability/unacceptability, but strictly legal versus illegal.  If someone, right now, were to burn a flag in front of me, I would not try to have them arrested because he has not violated any law.  What I am saying is that I think that there should be a law against it.  For my part, when I see someone burning a flag in protest, even if I might have been supportive of their cause previously, they have lost my support, and may have even pushed me to be against it depending on what their cause is.  Johnathan - Somewhere back aways, you were asking about other ways of defiling the flag, I think.  When a flag gets old or tattered, there are ceremonies to cover properly destroying the flag.  Under standard flag etiquette, the flag that was on top of the WTC should have been destroyed long ago, but it has now become a different type of symbol all together.
Perhaps one could create a cloth flag that lacks one stripe, or several stars, and set *that* on fire.  It would kind of *look* like the flag, but not really *be* the flag, thus keeping all true flags safe.  One could even market it as the Safe Protest Flag, and sell it at convenience stores.  Or, one could perform a 'Flag Threatening,' in which a protestor holds a flag *close* to an open flame, but does not catch it on fire, thus conveying one's emotion without actual destruction of the object.  Perhaps the apprehension an observer might feel watching such an act would yield the same impact as actual destruction.
john: ok, i'm going to pick on you now.  i'm sure you're worried.  :)   concerning the legality of burning the american flag, you said:  ' Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off. However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys[sic]. It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  '  i have no problem with that; you have every right to be pissed off, just as the protestors have every right to piss you off.  onward; you also said:  '  Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal. As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  '  the irony is interesting, and somewhat intentional, no doubt; but more importantly, the act of burning the flag identifies the protest in question as a serious one, garnering the attention of the public that the protestors are looking for in regards to their cause.  it shows people that they're mad about what our country is doing - so mad, in fact, that they feel like burning their own flag.    ' People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech. Hog wash. If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  '   assuming you meant to type ' Free speech [just] does not apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable ', tell me, then, if this is what you're saying:   that americans who burn the american flag in a show of protest against US policies should be arrested, because it is socially unacceptable for them to do so, considering they're citizens of a country that lets them protest  without  being arrested.    the definition of what is 'socially acceptable' is just a vague as the definition of 'free speech'; more so, in some cases, given the fact that social standards differ from person to person, city to city, culture to culture... even within the US.    i would daresay that infringing on the rights of others in regards to their own individual pursuit of life, liberty and happiness is unacceptable.  that means i shouldn't be allowed to burn anything on your personal property without your express permission, whether it's a flag or a cross.  doing so on public property, though, is another matter entirely.  that means that *any* group, whether it's white supremisists or dirty hippies, has the right to express themselves in whatever way they see fit, provided their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.  this rule means i could be exposed to plenty of activities and ideas i'm not happy with; but if i am certain of my convictions, they will be made all the stronger via the comparision.    furthermore, ridiculous ideas and beliefs tend to get  stronger  if repressed, not weaker. better to let everything out into the light of day; after a day or so, you'll be able to distinguish between the profound and the poop, via the smell, if you take my meaning.
I will repeat the question:  What should be done *now*?  A shame that 200,000 people organized themselves only to express anger.  Such honest effort and energy expended to no end other than brief catharsis.
The protest wasn't against the war.  Where the hell did you guys hear that?  It was against Bush visting England.  People here are incredibly angry at him and they didn't want the US media to have a nice photo-op moment showing how loved Bush is in England, America's best friend.  And the march slogan was simple: 'Go home Bush!'  The protest was awesome!  Over 200,000 people were there.  I think that we got the point across that Bush is not welcome here.   By the way, why on Earth would you topple down statues of Chirac and Schroeder?  For not siding with the US in an illegal invasion of a country?  Were you too busy eating Freedom Fries to realize that countries have the freedom not to side with the US when it does bad things? (On a side note, 'French' fries were actually invented in Belgium.)
this is just  urlLink pathetic  -  http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/031120/482/rs10811202309
Meanwhile, this headline from CNN:  'Police await Michael Jackson's surrender'  How does one catch a Smooth Criminal?
Does any country know how to solve complex problems?  It seems analogous to hoping that a single wave will reshape a coastline.  Change occurs over long periods of time, according to the effects of many disparate forces, each acting separately and often without any awareness of the other.  The best anyone can hope for is to be one of those myriad disparate forces.  A human lifetime is too short a span to allow for complete understanding of long-term change.  My fear is for movements that lack proper perspective.  How many of us recall one isolated incident with our parents that redirected our entire lives for the worse, in some way, leaving a permanent scar?  Yet at that moment, the parent perceived that the action was warranted and appropriate.  It seems to me that wisdom begins with perspective.  And perspective is what the current anti-war movement seems to lack.  A shame, really, because the forces they are protesting -- the hawks of the right -- seem to me, to lack perspective themselves.  Us and Them, targeting issues and each other, firing wide, missing the mark, perpetuating the illusion of dialogue, while History does its own thing in the middle of it all, heedless of the sound and fury.
a pause in the current discussion; then, please continue:  The  urlLink Richmond Indigenous Gourd Orchestra , containing some alumni and friends of the Ululating Mummies, is playing   urlLink Ashland Coffee & Tea  on November 28th at 8pm (that's the day after thanksgiving).    should be a good time, so come and get your native on for a mere $5; 'paleolithic lounge music' awaits you.  the aforementioned  urlLink venue  appears to sell tickets online for the shows, though the R.I.G.O. is not listed at this time.
i agree with you johnathan - it does seem silly to protest a war that has happened and what exactly is the message now that we couldn't really leave without causing more chaos than before.  (ie, afghanistan)  i believe one of the major problems with protests at this point is that there is no clear message that can be chanted as you march.  like, 'we didn't want this war in the first place, even though saddam was a horrible dictator, but there are horrible dictators across the globe, but now we hope for democracy, but that doesn't seem to be happening, and how can we afford this with so many domestic issues, and i need a slurpee because my throat is sore from so much chanting' it's an issue that cannot be solved by slogans or 10 second sound-bites.  which is scary - because i don't know if this country knows how to solve complex problems -
I am not a 13th century BCE Hebrew.  Nor do I wish to be a citizen of a theocracy.  The notion that humans require a deity to identify and enforce ethical behavior is absurd.  Also, note that democracy emerged from pagans, not from Hebrews.  If one shouldn't burn the flag, can one burn a copy of the Constitution?  Or the Declaration of Independence?  Should one not throw a flag away?  How about cutting it?  Or placing it in acid?  Should one not discard it out the window of a car?  Should one not draw on it?  What if I draw on a painting of a flag?  Is a painting a flag?  Or is it only cloth?  Does plastic count?  Does it have to be a rectangle?  What of flag bookmarks?  Flag shot glasses?  Flag shirts, socks, hats?  What if I am angered by the discovery of something horrible that my country sanctioned, and I want to remove the flag sticker from my car -- should I wait until I've calmed down, so the act of disposing of the flag sticker won't be soiled by my mood at the time?  Here's a quandary:  All the people protesting in Great Britain today are encouraging those who committed the latest bombings in Turkey.  *Even* if they honestly don't think they're doing so!  Conundrum Corner indeed!  yelahneb:  If Iraqis feel that they can bicker amongst themselves, but if someone tells them what to do, they want none of it.  In America, that feeling is a source of pride.  Yet we disregard Iraqis who feel that way.  Ironic, no?  The current anti-war movement lacks focus, and has not yet produced a clear thesis.  I realize it *thinks* it has, and I acknowledge the thrill and glee of joining a movement, however vague its nature -- but I have yet to hear a clear, compelling manifesto.  Which is a shame, because for all the effort it takes to make and topple a statue, it means nothing without a meaningful message.  I'm sold on the fad, but not the thinking.  A question to the Left:  Assuming that you are correct, that the war was misguided (and I am inclined to agree, to a point), what will it take for the 'movement' to move into the present situation?  Protesting a war that has already happened seems rather silly.  What is the goal -- to get a leader elected who will pull everything *out* of Iraq immediately?  Surely it would be clear to a careful observer that the resulting vacuum would be even worse.  Given that -- what is the *present* strategy of the Left?  What should be done with the *current* situation?  A complete pullout?  Half?  What, exactly?  Assuming the war was wrong -- what should be done *now*?  Assuming our election was a fraud -- what should be done *now*?  Protesting occurs in the present.  Once the protested event is past, the act becomes whining.  An unfortunate, but honest truth.  What do we do *now*?  -- Nonaffiliated But Engaged in Virginia
What?  Am I, as your soon-to-be-wife, not considered a fellow blogger?  I know who Michael Kamen is, monkey...I remember him not only from his film scores, but from that great performance of 'Dream On' he did with Aerosmith for MTV's tenth anniversary special.  'Twas keen.  Sad am I that he is gone.  John,  urlLink here is a list  of movies he's scored.
Johnathan - Sadly, I don't recognize the name.  What moves did he score?  Mir - I wouldn't necessarily classify you as a flaming liberal, but there is definitely some smoke rising around you.  Ben - Do you want pictures of the statue or of the nudists?  Speaking of the statue, do the protestors see how silly it is?  Bush is not being toppled, Sadaam was.   If  Bush loses the election next November, he will still be President for another 14 months.  And, he won't be a hunted man in his own country.  Hey, maybe we should hold a protest over here and topple statues of Chirac and Schroeder!  Yeah, that will show the French and Germans!
Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal.  As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech.  Hog wash.  If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  The Ten Commandments - Given that every judge puts his hand on a bible and swears to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America to the best of their ability without reservation or purpose of evasion,  so help me God  and that all witnesses swear on a bible to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,  so help me God , I don't see where the disconnect is.  Additionally, can anyone say that if we as a nation were to live by the Ten Commandments, that the we would be worse off?
the image created in my mind from the last bit got me:  'Home Secretary David Blunkett has refused to grant diplomatic immunity to armed American special agents and snipers travelling to Britain as part of President Bush's entourage this week.  In the case of the accidental shooting of a protester, the Americans in Bush's protection squad will face justice in a British court as would any other visitor, the Home Office has confirmed.   The issue of immunity is one of a series of extraordinary US demands turned down by Ministers and Downing Street during preparations for the Bush visit.  Demands for the US air force to patrol above London with fighter aircraft and Black Hawk helicopters have also been turned down.'
JLS: feel what way, specifically?  nick and eva:  interesting about the statue bit; excellent street theater.  makes me flash upon the cover of Moore's latest book.  send pics please!  btw, did you catch the protest staged by the nudists?  mir: what did the indians say in response to your suggestion?  john: a side thought, but i'm curious - what's your take on the legality of the burning of the american flag?    for that matter, what are everyone's thoughts on the presence of the ten commandments in government buildings?
Film composer Michael Kamen died of a heart attack recently.  John may be the only other blogger who recognizes the name.
I wonder if Iraqis feel this way.
a short story to prove john's point - and in case you don't know nick, i'm a flaming liberal  (at least for virginia)and john is a staunch conservative. (in a moderate kind of way) i was out having dinner with some friends and two exchange students from india.  we were chatting about politics and i started to go on some rant about something or the other and one of the exchange students started going on about how yeah, america was such a international bully, destroying the planet, didn't know how to take care of its own people and so on - all of which i agree with  - however, hearing it from her - someone who voluntarily came to my country to take advantage of the educational opportunities just infurirated me.  i told her that if she hated the country that much then i'm sure a plane was leaving for india sometime soon and she should just go catch it.   listen, this country tries me nuts - but hell, it's my country and i don't need no mouthin' off from somebody who isn't even a citizen.   and yes, i know that is a narrow-minded point of view - but it is what i believed in that moment and what most americans believe.  i support the british protesting a president i can't stand but i seriously don't think anything will change as a result of it.  until we in this country get together and start actively protesting this man will things change.
Think of it as a family for a second.  My father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.  They bicker and argue with each other quite a bit (at least they did when they were younger).  But, if someone outside the family, even one of the spouses of the four siblings, were to say something derogatory about one of them, the other three will circle the wagons and defend the other, even if what was said was true or something that one of them had said before.  That is the way it is here.  We can bicker amongst ourselves, bitch about the government, and even leave the country for a change, but if someone outside of here tells us we need to change or attacks us (verbally  or physically), we will tell you in no uncertain words to go f*** yourself.  Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off.  However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys.  It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  As for the security issue, the same NBC report said that security was already higher than normal because of some intelligence indicating a possible Al Queda attack.  They actually had some British official discussing that briefly in the report.
i agree with eva - the burning  of the american flag will just turn people against your cause.   i would say, the best way to protest, is to not be violent or threatening - but rather peaceful, with a good solid message.   but most of all - don't say or insinuate that americans are stupid.  even americans who say americans are stupid don't want to hear from another country.
As I type, Mr Bush is having tea with the Queen a few miles away.  It must be strange for him, spending time with someone who's head of state even though they weren't elected, just because of who their family is.  The security crackdown here is unbelievable.  I read in yesterday's newspaper that 1 in 9 policemen, nationwide, is involved in the security operation surrounding Bush. Half the police in all of London, too, apparently.  If I weren't marching tomorrow, I think I'd carry out a few burglaries as far from George as possible.  Eva and I have been talking about ways of protesting Bush while making it difficult for the media to portray it as mindless 'anti-Americanism', which is an accusation Blair has made, predictably.  Any ideas?  Richard Dawkins said he wanted to see a burning American flag behind Bush in every shot, but Eva thinks this'll just look threatening to people in the US, and I can see her point.  Oh, and I think most of the protestors will be from the UK, but there'll be be some from elsewhere, including plenty from the US, if experience serves.
They are expecting between 60,000-100,000 people at the protest tomorrow in London.  Nick and I will be there.  At the end of the march, they are going to be knocking down a 6 meter statue of George Bush.  Toppling over statues seems to be symbolic in the US media as the end of a regime, so I think it is very appropriate.  I came here to get away from George.  He followed me to St. Petersburg when I was living there and now he's followed me to England.  He needs to stop sweatin' me.  I mean, I know that I'm super cool and all, but damn!
NBC news this morning was reporting that the British were expecting 100,000 protestors during President Bush's visit.  They were a little vague leading up to that statement, talking about Bush's general unpopularity in Europe and something about a large (no percentage given) portion of the population supporting Bush.  On a sidenote, I just about fainted when an AIDS activist was complimentary of the Presidents record on AIDS - has hell started to freeze?  Anyway, my question is simple.  Are the 100,000 protestors from the UK or are they from all over western Europe?

'The dream of a new nation was falling apart,' Schwarzenegger said. 'Events were spiraling downward. Divisions were deep -- merchant against farmer, big states against small, north against south. Our founding fathers knew that the fate of the union was in their hands, just as the fate of California is in our hands.'  But those delegates in Philadelphia produced what he called 'the miracle of Philadelphia.'

Just read  urlLink that Village Voice article . Scary - I understand that similar legislation was proposed Europe-wide.  Maybe it even went through.  The definition they give for terrorists is pretty loose, don't you think?  To whit: 'any association, organization, entity, coalition, or combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means'-  which, pared down, could include pretty much anyone with an opinion, couldn't it?  I mean, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney are a 'combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity' - and I'll bet they mean to achieve their nefarious ends 'through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means'... Mainly because 'other means' includes absolutely everything.  I'm going to call that 800 number and report them.

urlLink http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0346/otis.php  excerpt - ALEC's model legislation, drawn up by its 'Homeland Security Working Group,' is called the Animal and Ecological Terrorist Act, and it ostensibly focuses solely on groups like Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front, which have attacked homes and development projects that threatened the habitat of several species. But more mainstream groups, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), are also targeted by ALEC as a 'threat,' and the bill would back that up with severe action.   For activists, the danger lies in how A4884 defines 'terrorist' organizations, as 'any association, organization, entity, coalition, or combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means.' Activist groups fear that lawful dissent, such as demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns, and leafleting, might fall into any one of those categories, particularly the catchall phrase 'other means.' The bill also seeks to prohibit people from gathering photographic or videotaped evidence of illegal or harmful activities, effectively shutting down the camcorders and other tools used by 21st-century protesters. Additionally, the bill calls for the creation of a state-run website where people convicted of 'eco-terrorism or animal-rights terrorism' would be identified with photographs and stigmatized, much as states do with child molesters.

From a recent USN&WR:  Think gas is steep at $1.50 a gallon?  Look at it this way:  That $1.50 buys almost 100 tons of ancient plants, ecologist Jeffrey Dukes says in this months Climatic Change.

At each step, much of the original material decayed or escaped.

martices?   and couldn't you do an autopsy on the brains of people who supposedly had this disease to see if it was present and if so in what amounts?  there must be a way to scientifically prove that my cat made me into the evil bitch i am today.
BTW, the toxoplasma stuff comes out in the news every few years with the intention of shocking pet owners.  'Oh, it's not my fault for being a slut...my cat has infected me with promiscuous disease.'  If rats are infected, it causes slight behavioural changes, thought to increase the chance of transmission.  Well, it causes no behavioural changes in infected cats.  In humans also, there has been no conclusive evidence to show that behaviour is directly affected by the parasite.  They 'evaluate' people's personalities, and then test if they have the disease.  Well, that ends up being a correlational study.  How do you know that people who like cats don't have certain behavioural characteristics already?  Or that people who are more likely to clean litter boxes don't have a certain personality?  Or maybe people who don't clean their houses are more likely to get it since they would be the most likely candidates for rat infestation.  There is no ethical way to show if there is any truth behind the claims that it supposedly has mind-altering effects on humans.  The only way to test for the personality change would be to test their personality before and after infection.  Comparative studies are the only ones that would be scientifically worth anything.  For now, the claims are total bollocks...   Off the subject, did anyone else think that the 'Matrices' were absolute shite?  Yuck!

Oops, good point, Ben - I never said who I was. Hello, everyone, I'm Nick.  My connection is via Eva - she wickedly seduced me one stormy night in Wales and has come to the UK (my homeland) to haunt my every waking hour - and the occasional one when I'm asleep, too.  I'm a stand-up comic by trade (that's what I was doing in Wales. Eva has far less excuse.).  Don't have a website, I'm afraid, but there's a British comedy website called chortle and I'm reviewed/listed  urlLink there .  Just so as not to be completely disregarding recent topics, the situation here in the UK with regards to elections is that you can take time off work to vote - not the whole day, but half a morning or something - and your employer has to let you.  I think that only applies in general elections, though (the big ones where you're voting in a new government [actually it doesn't quite work like that here, but a full explanation would take me too far from the point]).  I don't think it applies for small, local elections - which is a shame, in a way, since those are the ones where your vote counts most and you have more of a chance to really change things. It seems to me that most of our big elections (in both countries) really only afford the public the chance to ratify elite decisions; they keep the population distanced from actual policy formation whilst providing the comforting illusion that our leaders are answerable to us.  On one level they are, of course, since we can vote them out (when we're allowed to every few years) - but really those changes are pretty cosmetic.  I think the limits of the system are shown up in the following hypothesis: Let's say you introduce mandatory voting, so that there's a 95% turnout. The elected government can claim quite a legitimacy with the mandate of a genuine majority of the population. Or it would, if not for the fact that the people are effectively coerced into making the choice. So to avoid this, a 'None of the above' option is introduced. So far, so democratic.  Now, here's the dilemma: What happens if a majority of the voting population goes with the 'None of the above' choice?  Nobody running for power can legitimately take office, since the people have expressed definitely that they don't want the candidates, but you can't just leave the government empty.  What do you do? As far as I can see the system fails at this point. The powers that be can't really allow the electorate a full and comprehensive democratic choice, since there's the risk that people might use it, and that's not really what the electoral system is for.  Of course, there's already the option of not voting, or spoiling your vote, but that's fine provided those choices don't HAVE to be interpreted as 'None of the above'.  And to be honest, often a more realistic interpretation of not voting might be, 'Mmmmm... My bed's comfy.' Oops. A bit of a rant. Did Eva warn you about my tendency to do that?  To recap: 1. Hello, everybody, nice to meet you. and 2. I read too much Chomsky.

Fun, as long as everyone realizes the historical details -- or their veracity -- are inconsequential; only the meaning matters.
from  urlLink The Straight Dope :   Dear Cecil:  I hear Jesus wasn't really a Capricorn but that he was either a Pisces or a Leo instead--that his birthday is observed in December because the Catholic Church took over the ancient Saturnalia debauch. What's the lowdown? --Jerry M., Los Angeles    urlLink Dear Jerry:   History records no observation of Christmas before 354, and by that time there was no one around who remembered exactly when Jesus was born. Today, historians have all but given up trying to figure it out. They give his birth date as 6-8 BC (good trick, but this was no ordinary dude) and leave it at that.  Nobody knows exactly why Christ's birthday is celebrated on December 25. One theory holds that this is the right date, postulating that Zachary was high priest and that the Day of Atonement fell on September 24, ergo, John the Baptist was born on June 24 and Christ dropped in exactly six months later on December 25. Modern scholars use this theory to get laughs at cocktail parties.   Another guess works backward from the supposed date of the crucifixion (March 25), figuring that Christ was conceived exactly 33 years before he died, True Believers having no use for fractional numbers. According to the most tenable hypothesis, Christ's birthday was assigned to the winter solstice (December 25 in the Julian calendar, January 6 in the Egyptian) because the date had a ready-made pagan holiday, the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' (or 'ancient Saturnalia debauch,' as you put it).  The idea that Jesus was a Pisces probably comes from the characterization of that sign as one of spiritualism, humility, compassion, sacrifice, etc. Students of astrology will tell you it's not kosher to work the formula backwards that way.

WHITE HOUSE COVERS TRACKS BY REMOVING INFORMATION  In a high-tech cover-up, the Washington Post this morning reports the White House is actively scrubbing government websites clean of any of its own previous statements that have now proven to be untrue. Specifically, on April 23, 2003, the president sent his top international aid official on national television to reassure the public that the cost of war and reconstruction in Iraq would be modest. USAID Director Andrew Natsios, echoing other Administration officials, told Nightline that, 'In terms of the American taxpayers contribution, [$1.7 billion] is it for the US. The American part of this will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans for any further-on funding for this.'  The president has requested more than $166 billion in funding for the war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan this year. But instead of admitting that he misled the nation about the cost of war, the president has allowed the State Department 'to purge the comments by Natsios from the State department's Web site. The transcript, and links to it, have vanished.' (The link where the transcript existed until it caused embarrassment was  urlLink www.usaid.gov/iraq/nightline ).  When confronted with the dishonest whitewash, the administration decided to lie. A Bush spokesman said the administration was forced to remove the statements because, 'there was going to be a cost' charged by ABC for keeping the transcript on the government's site. But as the Post notes, 'other government Web sites, including the State and Defense departments, routinely post interview transcripts, even from 'Nightline,'' and according to ABC News, 'there is no cost.'  This story is not the first time the President has tried to hide critical information from the American public. For instance, the president opposed the creation of the independent 9/11 investigative commission, and has refused to provide the commission with critical information, even under threat of subpoena. Similarly, after making substantial budget cuts, the president ordered the government to stop publishing its regular report detailing those cuts to states. And when confronted with a continuing unemployment crisis, the president ordered the Department of Labor to stop publishing its regular mass layoff report.  It is also not the first time the administration has sought to revise history and public records when those records become incriminating. As the Post reports 'After the insurrection in Iraq proved more stubborn than expected, the White House edited the original headline on its Web site of President Bush's May 1 speech, 'President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended,' to insert the word 'Major' before combat.' And the 'Justice Department recently redacted criticism of the department in a consultant's report that had been posted on its Web site.'  Read the  urlLink Mis-Lead .

It has been established now with LOTR that what appears in the theater is not the film, but a conscious abridgement.  It is not the finished work.  Take a moment and think about that:  the artist first publishes/presents a conscious abridgement of the actual work, agreed upon by all parties involved, who know and accept that what was really completed will be released in a different format in a few months.  Not a Director's Cut, not Lost Chapters, not a reassessment now that time has passed.  A conscious, fully intended abridgement.  Released first.

from a  urlLink transcript  of the interview with Diane Sawyer that JLS mentioned earlier:   Bush also defended the intelligence that he used in citing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as a main reason for going to war. Asked about the emphasis now on alleged weapons 'programs' instead on possession of weapons themselves, Bush remained firm about his prewar assessment of the threat Saddam posed and insisted the world and America are safer because of the war that toppled him.   ' What's the difference? ' he said. 'If he were to acquire weapons, he would be the danger. That's what I'm trying to explain to you. A gathering threat, after 9-11, is a threat that needed to be dealt with.'    ...i guess the difference that immediately comes to mind would be the one between 1) telling the truth  and 2) lying.    what the fuck, bush?  is  that  the administration's answer to why we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?  that you figured we'd understand that when you  urlLink said  right before the war, 'The dictator of Iraq and his weapons of mass destruction are a threat to the security of free nations',  what you *meant* was, 'The dictator of Iraq is  planning  on producing weapons of mass destruction at some point in future, which  at that time  will be a threat to the security of free nations?'  added bonus: he managed to drop a 9-11 reference into a discussion about the justification for invading Iraq.    dammit to hell; enough of this.  i never expected to agree with the bush administration's policies, but the very least they could do is be straightforward with the people who pay their salaries.

Johnathan - I don't understand the first part of the response.  I do agree that it is totally on the fickle citizenry and not a measure of the actual politician's skill.  Really, how much skill does it take to talk out of both sides of your mouth like most politicians do?  To quote James Carville (Clinton's attack dog), 'It's the economy, stupid.'  If people are feeling confident in their wallets, the incumbent generally has no problems.  Ben - So we should not have tracked him down, left the country, and let him resume control?  Reports on the news are that most of the attacks are being carried out by Hussein loyalists, Al Queda, or jihadists, not the normal citizens who were brutalized by Hussein.  I have not seen any smug comments for the Republicans, only satisfaction from the military commanders.  That's not to say there won't be, but I have not seen any yet.  As far as WMD, at this point I don't think anyone thinks they will be found.  We can debate from here to eternity about whether or not they ever existed, whether they were smuggled out of the country before the invasion, and whether we were intentionally misled by the President, or if he was misinformed by the intelligence aparatus.  We don't know and probably never will know the certain truth.  You'll believe what you want and I'll believe what I want.

It's not hard to be Teflon if one provides bread and circuses.  If Hitler had not opened a second front and had focused a little more on atomic science, we would have had a Teflon fuehrer.  Getting through/around political trouble is not a measure of skill; it's a measure of the citizenry's contentment.  That said, the American citizenry seem very content.  As long as this doesn't change, a president can do whatever he or she wants.
First the economy starts to recover, and nwo Hussein.  I think it wil be fun to watch the 8(?) of them go at each other now as they try to find a sticking campaign point.  It has already started this morning with Lieberman calling out Dean on Meet the Press concerning the course of action Dean wanted to take with regards to Iraq.  Does anyone else that Bush is starting to resemble Reagan with his ability to get through/around political trouble?  Remember the Teflon President?  I'm asking whether you agree with either's politics, as I know most of you don't.  Just whether you see any similarity.

Eva - Perhaps you could explain to me why a single cent of the $20 billion dollars the  US is paying  for reconstruction should go to any country that opposed the _____ (insert your preferred term for the action taken).  If France, Germany, or Russia wish to pony up their own money to reconstruct things and get their contractor's to do so, then let them.  But, as I understand the basis of their arguements, they are upset that we won't let their contractor's bid on projects being paid for with US (and maybe UK?) money.  Mir - Some?  Yes.  Enough to do the job in the near future?  Doubtful.  In my dealing with Contractor's, I have found most of them to be so tight that they squeak and that they claim not to have two pennies to rub together.  So, odds are, except for management and certain ultraskilled positions, they will probably hire Iraqi's to do alot of the work as a cost savings method.  If you bring over your American crews, you need to pay much more (travel and housing) versus using someone local.  I hope and think that most contractor's will do that (see, greed is not always bad)  As far as the medical question goes, your conservative comment seems to imply that you think only conservatives are rich and powerful.  I recall a survey, several years old now, that was looking at the net worth of U.S. Senators.  You might be surprised to learn that there were more Democratic millionaires than Republican.  I honestly don't remember if was a 45 to 40 thing or a 10 to 5, but that is not my point.  There are quite a few rich powerful liberals that aren't champoining these causes either.  Also, do you think that no research is being done on either of the two diseases you specifically mentioned?  Angie can correct me here if I am wrong, but I think that fibro was only recently (last 3-5 years) actually classified as a disease.  I don't think you can expect too much research on a disease most doctors don't know even exists.  I would expect that research is underway now.  As for autisim, I know that research is being done.  There has been some recent finding that some medium used to prepare or administer childhood vaccinations has a mercury compound in it.  There appears to be some connection between the that and autism.  It must be a recent finding, because in 2000, nothing was said about this to us when Katherine got her immunizations, but everytime we get a shot for the twins, it is included in the information given to us.  It does make me ask the question, what is worse - losing your child to mumps, rubella, or polio or having them permanenetly disabled by the prevention?  That's not a choice I really want to make.  Keep in mind that there is only one pot of money for medical research, currently provided by both the public and private sector.  That money has to be divided up amongst AIDS, cancer, MS, heart disease, paralysis and a myriad of other diseases/conditions that I did not mention.  I have much more faith in the private sector to get the most out of this finite pot of money than I do the government.  I have worked for the government and currently work with government programs.  The bureaucratic BS and innefficiencies are maddening.  Money is held up because a form was not filled out 100% correctly or because some Congressman has not had his chance to make a press release about getting the money for his district.  At least with the private sector, they want to get breakthroughs so they can get the return on their investment.  It really is sad that someone is going to benefit from someone else's suffering, but I can't think of a better motivator, since there are very few people in this world who are solely devoted to the relief of suffering (like Mother Teresa was).

All I've got to say is this: Bush is a fucking moron!  He has just claimed Iraq as property of the US.  What fucking right does the US have to not allow countries that didn't support the invasion of Iraq to help in the reconstruction effort.  Sorry for the profanity...I'm very angry today.   grrrr!  Okay...on to happy things...I'm coming home on the 17th and I'm bringing Nick with me!  Unfortunately, I have to stay and Nick gets to go back to England.  I been here for nearly 6 months, so I've got stay in the US for a while.  Stupid England.  Wait...that makes me angry again.  grrr!  Damn this bipolar disorder.
and as far as socialized medicine is concerned, the best way to get funding for an ailment is to have a conservative have something horrible befall his family.  i bet if a powerful conservative had a relative with fibromalygia or autism or whatever that a lot more funding would go that way.
what is up with you and shrugging ben? and john, i think there's got to be some professionals (engineers and the like) in iraq who could be used in this process.  if they were able to develop  weapons of mass destruction (cough, cough) then they must have scientists and an educated segment of society.
i think that *shrugs* only those countries who *shrugs* helped destroy iraq's infrastructure *shrugs* should be allowed *shrugs* to help rebuild it; there's a terrible *shrugs* symmetry to it, *shrugs* the irony of which is probably lost *shrugs* to those in power.  as for dean, *shrugs* i think his best bet is to *shrugs* pick up clark *shrugs* as his VP *shrugs* to help pull in centrists *shrugs* and moderate repubs *shrugs* who are unhappy with bush.
Johnathan - I agree with the similarities between 2004 and 1996 with regards to the motivations of the political parties.  One difference I see is what happened in the 1994 and 2002 mid-tem elections.  Historically, the party out of power gains seats in Congress in the mid-terms.  In 1994, that paragon of virtue (tic) Newt Gingrich managed to energize the Republicans on a national level to take back the House for the first time in 40 or so years.  He then of course proceeded to blow his momentum and hand Clinton the White House in 1996 through a number of missteps.  Fast forward to 2002, and Gephardt (sp?) was banking on retaking control of the House and firming control of the Senate.  Instead, the House remainined in Republican control and the Senate went back to the Republicans.  What does that mean for the upcoming election?  Probably not a damn thing, but it is a difference.  I do have to laugh at the Democrats first harping on the fact the Iraq was going to be a military disaster, which it was not.  Then they latched on to the economy being terrible, but now it is recovering very nicely.  So now they are back to Iraq and the post 'war' efforts and saying we need to get things under control.  But, I am not hearing many solutions, just pointing out the problems, which I fully agree are there.  Angie - Thanks, that makes me much less afraid of Dean.  I did not know he is a doctor.  I have not heard any of Dean's details on the medical front and will not pay attention to them unless and until he becomes the actual nominee.  But, one concern I have of government mandates on things like insurance and medicine, is that it smacks of socialism.  Canada has socialized medicine.  Everyone is covered and the quality of care is good from what I have witnessed.  The problem is with availability of some forms of treatment.  My mother, who handles the insurance for her doctor's office and has many chronic ailments (lupus, arthritis), told me the waiting list for heart catheterization is about 18 months in Canada.  The problem is, when someone needs that procedure, they need it pretty much imediately.  Most people don't survive 18 months, so they travel to the US and pony up the cash to have it done here.  I guess my point is, for right or wrong, profit is what drives most things in this country.  The insurance companies and doctors have to be able to profit from their work or they will do something else, creating a shortage.  I will be curious to see how he addressed this in Vermont.  If the government steps in much further, I am afraid that our medical system will be hurt severly.  Case in point of the profit driven results is Viagra.  I'm sure that there were many other diseases/conditions that Pfizer could have researched besides male impotence.  But, look at the original target 'audience' - Middle Aged White Males.  They knew that they would be able to make a proverbial killing from the general affluence of that market.  In the meantime, research into chronic illnesses go underfunded or totally unresearched.  Mir - I would hope that we will utilize Iraqis as much as possible.  However, given the magnitude of the problems that need to be addressed, I doubt that they have the numbers and/or specialties necessary to do it all.  If we are talking road and bridge work, I would assume that the Iraqis have the ability to do those.  But, if we are talking about updating the electrical system nationwide, they probably don't.  Heck, given what happened here over the summer, you could say that neither the US or Canada do either.
i think that most of the work to build up iraq should be given to iraqi companies or/and as many iraqis as possible should be employed for these projects.
Answer from Ever-so-slightly-left-of-the-middle:  Though Dean's stance is to be as anti-Bush as possible, if you actually listen to him in his speeches and campaigning, he's really not that leftist.  He is about Bush (but not necessarily Iraq), and he is about health care (because he's a doctor).  But in terms of gun control, abortion, the environment, blah blah blah, he's really no more left that the other candidates, if not leaning a little more towards moderate in such areas.  And I think he's a fiscal conservative as well.  He just likes to talk Bush-smack to get people all fired up, even if some of their non-foreign policy political ideologies are not so deeply divided.  That's just what I gleaned from watching him the few times that I have...I just like him because of his health care reform.  Being that I'm a non-senior-citizen with a disability, there aren't a lot of options for people like me, and I like his ideas on how to fix that.  *shrugs*  Bush-smack sounds...dirty.  Sorry.
Answer from the Middle:  Dean's status in the polls is founded entirely on an anti-Bush movement.  Ironically, the Left's motivation for this election -- we hate Bush, we gotta get rid of this man -- is very reminiscent of the Right's motivation in the Clinton era.  Both sides -- the Right, then, and the Left, now -- lacked, and lack, a vision, a plan, a drive to execution.  At 9/11, the Right reacted quickly with a vision and a plan, while the Left sputtered and blew the moment.  Now the Left can only play catch-up, and the only thesis on the table is getting rid of Bush.  The Left needs a vision, a plan, and a reliable leader to initiate the march -- one who won't throw it all away on a cigar and a beret.  Until that happens, they will flail about in vague, yet honest, frustration and anger.  For now, the Right has the money and the product:  Fear sells, and everybody's buying.
Thanks for the response.  It clears up some things.  And don't forget -- as long as an open seat remains,  you're always welcome to return to RTG!
Yesterday (or Tuesday), Al Gore endorsed Howard Dean to receive the Democratic Presidential nomination.  What caught my attention was the press reporting of it.  They said that Al Gore was a centrist Democrat and that Dean was much further left of him.  Do you agree with this?  If so, I am terrified to think that Dean might win the White House, as I have always considered Gore to be a fringe left wing loonie.  If Dean truly is left of Gore....  On a funny note, Dean is aparently raising most of his money via the internet.  If that is the case, he owes Al Gore two thank yous.  First for the endorsement.  But most importantly for the internet, because we all know that Al Gore invented the internet.
Well, since I am the only one on the right remaining on the blog, I'll give you my opinion.  As with most things, if you want to get a good idea of an entities reasoning for taking an action, follow the money.  I saw many pieces of infomration back in January and February listing the reasons behind France's, Germany's, and to a lesser extent Russia's opposition to the then proposed military actions against Iraq.  They were the top three countries in oil exploration and refining in Iraq, violating many of the UN sanctions against Iraq.  They knew that any change in the government of Iraq would likely cost them those lucrative contracts, rights, and infrastructure.  So they opposed it.  I'll try to locate the information I saw back then and post it here.  Now they are complaining that we won't let them benefit again on the backs of the Iraqi's.  Additionally, I would bet, but don't know for sure, that the money for this work is coming from the US and maybe the UK.  Why would either country want to give this money to someone else who opposed the action to begin with?  Childish?  Most definitely, but it is reality.  Now, if you can show me some work that a) will not be done in a timely fashion because there are not enough companies to do the work or b) only a company from one of those countries is qualified to do, I will have a problem with it.  Otherwise, you reap what you sow.  As an add on to b), the only thing that I comes to mind right off hand is nuclear material clean up.  France would be good at this since they provide a large percentage of their power through nuclear power, and are pretty good at dealing with the waste.  But, since Iraq does not have a nuclear program, I guess that rules that possibility out.
ben likes talking meat.
Will someone on the right explain for what we are doing in Iraq?  I learned this morning that companies native to any country that did not support the invasion are not allowed to help the reconstruction.  I'm having trouble figuring out why this is a good idea.
i thought the earthquake was coolio.
here you go:  urlLink 4.5 earthquake   there was a mini-evacuation downtown where i work; lots of curious and confused folk outside their respective buildings, wondering what happened.  apparently it was felt as far as petersburg; the link below suggests it was felt much further than that.  here's a  urlLink graph  showing reports from around our area and beyond.
Hm?  My building's floor shook a while ago.  But it does that on occasion, usually caused by passing trucks or some such.  Strange if it was the same shake.
Who else felt that?  I thought someone ran into our building.
Hmm.  I did not consider the multiple images of Neo to be the previous One.  I considered that they were merely images of what reaction the Matirx/Architect determined to be likely responses from Neo.
Note that in the monitors, the previous Neos all look the same.  Three possibilities:  (1) this is an illustrative image by the filmmakers, to show that the previous anomalies were variations of a single effect, though of course they could not be the same physical body -- which means the monitors are there for either the audience's benefit or Neo's:  ours, in that we need to have this concept presented graphically, or Neo's, in that the Architect is artificially recreating Neo's face to show what the previous anomalies have done, though they would have to have been historically different, unique physical individuals; (2) all anomalies, for some reason, assume within the matrix the physical appearance of what would be the 6th anomaly, i.e., simplisticly, the appearance of Keanu Reeves; or (3) the body of the single individual who represents the anomaly -- to simplify again, Keanu Reeves -- continues to be liberated from and reinserted into the matrix; thus, what we witness at the end could be what has happened five times before:  the physical body returns to the Source, possibly to be placed once again into a stasis pod.  Which means that Neo -- again, the physical body of Keanu Reeves -- has now experienced *six* violent liberations from his physical stasis pod.  In this way, the cycle repeats not only within the Matrix, but in the physical world, as well.
The Architect  - Hello, Neo.   Neo  - Who are you?   The Architect  - I am the Architect. I created the matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also irrelevant.   Neo  - Why am I here?   The Architect  - Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden to sedulously avoid it, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.   Neo  - You haven't answered my question.   The Architect  - Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*  Others?  What others?  How many?  Answer me!'    The Architect  - The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.  *Again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Five versions?   Three?   I've been lied too.   This is bullshit!    Neo : There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.   The Architect  - Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.  *Once again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   You can't control me! Fuck you!  I'm going to kill you!  You can't make me do anything!    Neo  - Choice. The problem is choice.  * The scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room *   The Architect  - The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect. It was a work of art, flawless, sublime.  A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.   However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.   Neo  - The Oracle.   The Architect  - Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.   Neo  - This is about Zion.   The Architect  - You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.   Neo  - Bullshit.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Bullshit!    The Architect  - Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.  * Scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room. *   The Architect  - The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals: 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.   Neo  - You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive.   The Architect  - There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.  *The Architect presses a button on a pen that he is holding, and images of people from all over the matrix appear on the monitors*   The Architect  - It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the one. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-a-vis, love.  *Images of Trinity fighting the agent from Neo's dream appear on the monitors*   Neo  - Trinity.   The Architect  - Apropos, she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.   Neo  - No!   The Architect  - Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning, and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to the left leads back to the matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice.   But we already know what you're going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.  *Neo walks to the door on his left*   The Architect  - Hmph. Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.   Neo  - If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.   The Architect  - We won't.
Two cents:  I think the machines kept Neo alive for fear that if he died, another One would appear and the cycle would repeat.  Same with why they chose not to destroy Zion -- because inevitably the cycle would repeat, and they'd have to do it again.  The Oracle allowed Smith to absorb her so that she could help Neo when he confronted Smith in the final battle; she was left behind when Smith was destroyed.  Speaking for yelahneb:  Ben's theory is that Neo has been altered with cyborg-like implants that allow him to connect with the machines.  I'm not satisfied with this interpretation, but I haven't come up with anything more satisfying myself.  In general, it seemed to me that the goal was not victory/defeat (1 or 0), but the breaking of a cycle: something that was neither 1 nor 0.
I watched for twenty minutes, was wildly unentertained and turned it off.  Seemed like change for the sake of change.  I mentioned to Angie, I've always felt that if we don't like someone because they're unlikeable, the script is good; if we don't like someone because we're supposed to not like them, the script is bad.  A lot of 'this one's supposed to be evil;' 'this one's supposed to be good;' 'oh, now, this one's supposed to be a rascal, look out.'  I might try again some random day when it reruns.  Lower expectations might help on a second attempt.

Aparently the recently rumored new B5 based series is one step closer to reality.  JMS said he was working on a script to be ready in the next few weeks.  It has a working name of B5:TMoS.  One person guessed (tic) that it was B5:  The Making of Spoo.
If you move past the debate of whether or not the project is needed or if the benefits out weigh the costs/impacts, then we design the projects with human safety as the number one criteria.  The FAA has specific requirements for the grades (steepness) of runways, taxiways and the areas surrounding them to provide a safe operational environment.  Local, state, and Federal requirements then dictate that the designs be accomplished with the smallest amount of impcat to waters of the US, wetlands, and forests (especially in Maryland - the tree is as holy as cows are in India).  It all ends up being a balancing act of safe environment, limited environmental impacts, and minimizing costs (which are 95% funded by the FAA).  In the end, the owner usually does not have too much input on the specifics of how something is done, after all that is what they are paying me for.  They just want their new runway (in this case) and leave the details to us.  To answewr your question, we go to the middle ground as much as possible, if for no other reason than it is legally required.  If I did not have these restrictions, my job would be much easier, but also way more boring.    It is kind of funny because in WWII there were alot of airfield constructed.  In Virginia alone Norfolk, Richmond, Newport News, Roanoke, Suffolk, Franklin, West Point, Emporia, Petersburg, Accomack, and Danville were all constructed in the early 1940's.  For the most part these were built by the Army on swamp land.  Today, they would never be built, because of all the wetland (swamp) impacts.  The group that oversees wetlands?  The US Army Corps of Engineers.  How's that for irony?
What is your take on environmental issues vs. airports?  When engineering, do you design entirely in favor of the client (the owners, I assume), or do you recommend middle ground?  My dad was an engineer who sold the chemicals used to make circuit boards, but was always aware of their environmental impact, even though he had little control over the product (beyond understanding and explaining the ways how his product would be more safe than a competitor's in this instance or that, if the customer asked).
Thanks.  I got a call from the reporter on Tuesday to confirm some things.  I hate talking to them because of the fear of being misquoted on a sensitive subject.  It is really bad when something the consultant says to the press raises a firestorm of local reaction.
Also -- Congratulations on making the Washington Post!  It must be very rewarding to be recognized out of town, even in one paragraph.  Always cool to know an expert in a field, regardless of the field.
If the [government] can misrepresent something relatively simple, [like Iraq's WMDs or its links to 9-11], how much [does it] get wrong on issues where people don't know the details?  Not presenting the truth, in my opinion, is the same as [lying in running a government].  It's unlikely that anyone who has entered the public forum can be taken wholly at face value.  Thanks for the words!  ;-)
This is why I don't trust the press to be fair in their reporting.  At least sites/organizations like Salon and Rush Limbaugh are honest about their view of things.   urlLink The press' representation of the public hearing I presented at on Monday   Now, there is nothing untrue in the article.  But, it leaves the impression that there was only dissent.  There were 5 speakers - 1 (Mr. Wilmont) expressed environmental concerns, 1 (Mr. McHaffey) expressed concerns about property value and noise, the other 3 were speaking in favor of the project.  Mr. Wilmont's comments were well expressed and received (unlike some public hearings I have attended where people were ranting and raving), and his comments are acurately and fully presented in the article.  Mr. McHaffey was more concerned with the rezoning of his property from residential to industrial in the past couple of years.  He has consistently (for the last 6 years anyway) complained about helicopter noise.  The proposed development will neither add to nor subtract from the helipcopter operations.  Again, while nothing printed is untrue of what he said, the emphasis of his comments is misrepresented.  Given the title of the article, you would think that nothing positive was said on the hearing.  There were 3 people speaking in favor of the project, and 4 of the 5 Commissioner's (same as Supervisors in Virginia) had positive comments and expectations resulting from the proposed expansion.  The last Commissioner did not comment.  My point is this.  If the press can misrepresent something relatively simple with a negative tilt, how much do they get wrong on issues where people don't know the details?  Reporters are supposed to report the facts and leave the opinions for the editorial page.  Not presenting the whole truth, in my opinion, is the same as stating your own opinions in a news story.

how did everyone get home on sunday?
Uh...no.
oh my god!  you've had all those guys at your house for 2 days!
Just overheard on MSNBC that the current administration is officially stating that no WMDs will be found in Iraq.  I was in the other room, though, so I may have heard wrong...
Just dug out three cars, cleared two spaces, and pushed out a fourth car.  Unemployment isn't what it used to be!

you are super cool, nick- i don't care what jason says about you.
What was the point of the ribs thing and why would the White House post it on their website?  Talk about bizarre.  Note that the question is not aimed at Ben.  If the President really was concerned about the woman's business, he would not have gone there are all since the Secret Service probably shut down her restaurant for a couple of hours and scared away all her normal business.
Greetings from Zagreb!  Thought it would be fun to post from a little further away than usual.  I'm in Zagreb, Croatia, where I did a gig last night (this is a pretty jet-setting time for me - I'm in Berlin in a few days).  It was my first time doing a gig to an audience who predominantly spoke English only as a second or third language.  Very interesting.  They were fine with most of the references (Bush, Iraq, Tony Blair, Harry Potter) and highly amused that my surname means 'poo' in the country of my betrothed.  The Bosnia/Croatia war was a no-go area, since Britain and France opposed Croatia's independence (I knew John Major would one day try to ruin a gig for me) and I think they were a little taken aback by my take on Catholicism, but it was a great night and felt really historic.  This is Croatia's first attempt at starting stand-up comedy and it was only their second show.  It's weird - I've never been shown actually doing my act on TV in Britain but in Croatia it took exactly one night.  Today I walked around Zagreb for about 3 hours.  It's a really beautiful city and has pretty much recovered from the war, cosmetically at least (socially, they have that World Bank/IMF thing going on: 5 per cent of the population is filthy rich and 40 per cent are below the poverty line).  Anyway, I've enjoyed being here immensely and thought I'd share.  The home page of the PC in my hotel is a hardcore porn site, which maybe isn't surprising for a Catholic country still in the throes of post-Communist freedom.  Nick
be at game from 12:30 until 3:30 - luc must go for awhile - she told me so.
meanwhile, in Roswell, NM:  urlLink ribs.  ribs, damn you!
gaming stuff -  guys, i will not be able to be there this sunday. i just got  a new job and i need to brush up some of my skills before monday - so i'm going to be spending my weekend studying. joy!   hopefully, mr. ben will agree to play the part of luc - and perhaps even miriam.
i got fitted for my bridesmaid's dress last night and despite what johnathan may think, i think i've got some junk going on in this trunk.
the democrats want to beat bush and they will accept no weakness from their top contenders - either win or be torn apart.  it's a pretty rough primary this time around.
Somebody explain something to me.  I'm sure it will come as no surprise that I don't care too much for Dean.  That being said, why is he being crucified for his animated speech after the Iowa Caucuses?  Was it over the top?  Sure.  Was he out of control?  I don't think so, he was caught up in the excitement of the crowd.  Give the guy a break.  He just saw his big lead disappear in a very short period of time and was pretty disappointed.  If you (pundits) want to pick him apart, at least do it based on the issues.  Although, I did see a couple of funny clips about it from Jay Leno and John Stewart.  But they will pick at any public figure.
somebody best give me a job soon or i'm going to eat some pudding pie!
For a moment I was trying to figure out Rush's political leanings, or if Peart, Lee, or Lifeson had recently been addicted to painkillers...kind of amusing, once I recognized the actual reference...
Fair warning to all - Since the station I used to listen to (Star 107 - mostly 80's) just changed formats to all Elvis all the time, and football season is over (meaning I have no interest in listening to any of the sports stations) and that this is an election year, I have decided to start listening to Rush again.  It has been over a year and it may not last long, but my posts may be more rabid then normal as I get exposed to more of the events (filtered through a majorly tilted view).  I'll let you know if the pain killers altered his mind.
I was equal parts annoyed and amused until...  a)  He started talking about healthcare, which made me want to throw all my medical and prescription bills in his face right after I kicked his ass b)  He flat-out dissed gay marriages  Beyond that, it was all just kind of in one ear and out the other...  Oh, but there is one thing.  Mr. President, the word is NU-KLEE-ER, not NU-CUE-LER. Thank you.
Gusev Crater, Tarus 23, XXVI (MPI) -- A spokesthing for Mars Air Force denounced as false rumors that an alien space craft crashed in the desert, outside of Ares Vallis on Saturday.   Appearing at a press conference today, General Rgrmrmy The Lesser stated that 'the object was, in fact, a harmless high-altitude weather balloon, not an alien spacecraft'.   The story broke late Saturday night when a major stationed at nearby Ares Vallis Air Force Base contacted the Gusev Crater Daily Record with a story about a strange, balloon-shaped object which allegedly came down in the nearby desert, 'bouncing' several times before coming to a stop, and 'deflating in a sudden explosion of alien gases.'   Minutes later, General Rgrmrmy contacted the Daily Record telepathically to contradict the earlier report. General Rgrmrmy stated that hysterical stories of a detachable vehicle roaming across the Martian desert were blatant fiction, provoked by incidences involving swamp gas. But the general public has been slow to accept the Air Force's explanation of recent events, preferring to speculate on the 'other-worldly' nature of the crash debris. Conspiracy theorists have condemned Rgrmrmy's statements as evidence of 'an obvious government cover-up,' pointing out that Mars no longer has any swamps.   They point to the release of secret government memos detailing attempts to discredit reports of the landings by alien space craft.   Local residents, like Driv Rhodo, who lives in the area of the alleged landings, are even more skeptical. 'I seen it with my own 5 eyes' claimed Rhodo last week. 'I've lived here over 300 years, most of my adult life-form. Them things used to be few and far between but lately they come in every few years or so. The government wants to bury the truth but I can tell you what's real. The Earthlings are going to invade and the government is spending our hard earned tax dollars on press releases and denials instead of preparing for the battle to come.'   A spokesthing denied any government involvement in the disappearance of Rhodo, who has not been seen since shortly after the interview, claiming 'Any sentient being knows that a planet with the concentrations of water and oxygen found on Earth is a deadly and inhospitable environment for the formation of life, much less intelligent life. The fear and consternation caused by the unfounded and wild speculations of citizens like Rhodo are a traitorous disservice to the citizens of Mars.'
I listened to about 15 minutes of the State of the Union last night while driving home (which means I heard about 1 minute of speaking and 14 minutes of Republicans standing and clapping).  Forgetting the topic of the exchange for a minute, I did hear a funny thing.  Bush was talking about the expiration of the 'let's get all the dirt we can on everyone and imprison people without due process' act.  He paused for some reason, probably dramatic effect.  At which point there was a smattering of applause from who I assume were Democrats.  Then he continued and said that the terrorist threat would not expire on the same deadline, which of course got a tremendous round of applause.  I saw a replay of that portion of the tape this morning.  He definitely enjoyed that little 'gotcha' moment.  And, like I said, ignoring the topic it surrounded for a moment, it was kind of funny.  Other than that, as much as I like politics, I can't stand the State of Union address.  It never really amounts to more than a chance for politicians to put on a public show of what they are for and against.  The party in power will say that it was a great speech.  The party out of power will say it failed to discuss the really important issues.  Instead, we watched a rerun of Early Edition on PAX.
Oh, and one more thing...I don't know about emotionally traumatic experiences, but I know from experience that  physically  traumatic experiences can alter your chemistry.  Since the breast reduction, I put weight on different areas of my body than I did before.  Also, doctors have attributed the triggering of fibro to severe physical trauma.  With me, it was most likely the breaking of bones and the whiplash-inducing car accidents I had near the onset of puberty.
God, I don't read the blog for a couple of days, and suddenly you guys are all prolific on my ass...  1)  I'm for Dean, because as a disabled person, his views on healthcare reform are compelling to me.  2)  I adored 'Lost in Translation' for the same reasons Johnathan did, and a few others.  One, it was very reminiscent of a relationship that I was once in.  Two, as an actor currently studying acting, I was fascinated by the performances and their varying techniques/approaches to their characters/styles, etc.  Their work was all so intimate that I almost felt voyueristic watching it at times, especially Bill Murray.  And I thought it was a beautiful story about a remarkable connection between two people.  That human quality is something I enjoy in movies...  3)  I thank God that taste changes over time, or I'd still be listening to my 'Rainbow Brite' LP about 50 times a day.  I agree with Johnathan that the tastes in almost anything (food, music, activities, films, etc.) that I've 'outgrown,' so to speak, will always hold a nostalgic value for me, even if I don't engage in them with any frequency anymore.  4)  Comfort is my new favorite restaurant...FRIED OKRA!!!  5)  Today was my first day of classes, and while I'm excited about the resurgence of productivity in my daily schedule, it absolute whooped my fibro-ridden ass.  Much pain now.  Me go bed.  6)  Oh, and I love Johnathan!
i think it would also be interesting to find out if traumatic experiences can actually effect our brain chemistry, long term.
That's interesting Johnathan.  In regards to music I have an eclectic taste.  I like the rock music of the 70's and 80's since they represent a much simpler and generally more enjoyable time of my life (nostalgia).  I can't stand most of today's music, partly based on lyrics/topics and partly based on the music itself.  I love big band music (Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, et. al) probably because I played alot of that in the jazz bands I was in in high school and college.  But for straight artistry, I love classical music (in the general definition of orchestral music).  Bach, Beethoven Tchaichovsky, Mussorgsky, Rossini, Copland, Wagner, Gershwin, even some Bernstein, and on and on.  When I get a chance and have had a stressful day or week, I lay flat on my back in front of the speakers and listen to some of this music, lose myself in the intricacies of the music and end up feeling much more relaxed and focused.  Sorry for drifting off topic there, but my point was that I had never thought about the fact that my taste in music has not changed much over the years and how that relates to heart and mind.  That would be an interesting study (what do changes in taste of art reflect on the growth of person?)  I bet some doctoral candidate has studied that at some point.
I did not come up with this.  I've seen it before with different people as the subject, but here goes.  With all your honor and dignity what would you do?  This test only has one question, but it's a very important one. Please don't answer it without giving it some serious thought. By giving an honest answer you will be able to test where you stand morally.   The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation, where you will have to make a decision one way or the other. Remember that your answer needs to be honest, yet spontaneous.   Please scroll down slowly and consider each line - this is important for the test to work accurately.   You're in Florida...In Miami, to be exact... There is great chaos going on around you, caused by a hurricane and severe floods ....... There are huge masses of water everywhere.... You are a CNN photographer and you are in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless.   You're trying to shoot very impressive photos.  There are houses and people floating around you, disappearing into the water. Nature is showing all its destructive power and is ripping everything away with it.   Suddenly you see a man in the water, he is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away by the masses of water and mud. You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar.   Suddenly you know who it is - it's George W. Bush!  At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him away...forever. You have two options. You can save him or you can take the best photo of your life. So you can save the life of George W. Bush, or you can shoot a Pulitzer prize winning photo. A unique photo displaying the death of one of the world's most powerful men.   And here's the question: (Please give an honest answer)  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Would you select colour film, or go with the simplicity of classic black and white?
My taste changes over time as well, though the recognition of objective quality (as I define it) remains constant.  It's probably more accurate to say what I 'like' changes over time, while what I admire or value remains the same.  I will always admire and value the craft and artistry of Pink Floyd.  But I rarely listen to them anymore.  When I do, I find I'm only visiting old stomping grounds.  The appeal is only in appreciation of craft and nostalgia for a time or place.  I am grateful for what they gave me at that time, but I now go to other sources for meaning or sustenance.  That said, I experience my changes in preference as a slow continuum.  If they happen rapidly for you, perhaps it is as I initially proposed -- that your relationship with art is largely, if not exclusively, personal and emotional.  In the context of this post, the heart changes more frequently than the mind.
johnathan - that's an interesting thought.   i had a weird thing happen to me this year, in terms of movies i like: i used to love the purple rose of cairo.  i watched it about 4 months ago and i thought it was one of the most contrived pieces of crap that i'd ever seen - what happened? can a person's taste change that much over the course of a few years?
although this means he will immediately change it, this so far has been a reliable way of distinguishing my posts from johnathan's -  he always has the word 'harmony' as part of his user id.
Movies?  What are these movies you speak of?  Are they a type of class?  Seriously though, I have only seen Terminator 3.  I have not even heard of 'American Splendor.'  There is nothing wrong with mass market films (baaa).  I want to go see RotK, but Julie has no desire to, and has not even seen TT yet, so she would be lost anyway (baaa).  Sorry, all this political discussion has me responding loke a politician and not answering your question (baaa).  BTW, who is this?  Johnathan or Mir?
Miriam -- From my observation of your reactions to movies and music over the years, I think it's safe to say that content is the key for you.  If the content doesn't connect, you won't like the film.  In that sense, it seems likely that you prefer either filmed essays or escapist tales.  There's nothing wrong with this; it's just seems to be how you relate to the arts.  That said, I suspect that Lost in Translation did not get you because the content wasn't engaging.  Because without the content, I feel there is plenty of evidence throughout that it is still a strong example of storytelling, character exploration, and filmcraft.  It seems to me that you approach the arts as a seeker -- a seeker of either ideas or entertainment -- rather than as an aesthete.  There is nothing invalid about approaching a work solely as a seeker; but the more personal the quest, the more limited the experience.  As for myself, the film connected profoundly with me, both personally and aesthetically.  I suspect that the film's content did not resonate with any aspect of your own personal search, and was promptly (and validly, for you) dismissed in all remaining categories.
i have a question about movies. i didn't really like 'lost in translation' or 'american splendor' i've heard really good reviews but they didn't move me or change me or even really entertain me that much.  i have to say my favorite films of last year were in order: 1. return of the king 2. pirates of the carribean 3. terminator 3 and yes, that is kinda embarrassing to admit.  while i enjoy action/adventure films, and i realize that return of the king is more than that, it isn't normally my entire list.  i don't usually even enjoy mass-market films - so my question to anyone with an opinion about this is: why did you like lost in translation?  what was good about bill murray's performance?  -  why did you like american splendor?
Nick - According to the book, what was the most scandalous thing going on?  I don't have time to read much anymore, and have never really read any non-fiction political books.  I only point to the vote counting since that is what the two rulings from the Supreme Court were about and the origin of the 'Selected, not Elected' mantra that Jesse Jackson and others continue to throw out.  I read part of the Greg Palast link.  If that is part of what you are referring to, then I would have to ask about the military absentee ballots that were discarded because they did not have post marks?  While certainly not a monolithic block ,the majority of military votes got to the Republicans.  These soldiers were serving in Bosnia and Saudi Arabia and Korea, but their votes were discarded because of a technicality of the military postal system.  There is no fool proof system.  To assert that the incompetence / laziness of the company (IBT?) was deliberate a full 7 months in advance of the election assigns them the power of clairvoiance to know that the election was going to be decided by the extremely close margin it was.  There is also the assumption that all of the people that were scrubbed (terrible word IMO) would have a) voted and b) voted for Gore (and not Bush or any of the other 5 or 6 candidates).  I don't think you will find many people who live in the real world that think that the 2000 election nationwide, not just in Florida, was unflawed.  There was the judge in St. Louis who ordered the polls to remain open 3 or 4 hours longer in one area for a reason that I can't recall.  That area just happened to be a largely black area and one where the Democrats were going door to door to get people to go vote.  There was also the 'math error' that led the networks to call Florida before the polls has closed.  It is impossible to know how many, if any, people in the panhandle, a largely Republican area, did not bother to vote because of this announcement.  Then there was the voter incompetence in Palm Beach(?) where the people did not know how to read the ballot.  The ballot they used there was the same type used in Chesterfield, and it was 100% clear to me.  It was a mess.  Back to a conversation from many months ago, I think many of the problems (election wise) would be solved if our participation in the process was increased. 50% for the presidential election is downright pathetic.  The reason I think it would be solved is that I think the Democrats would win handily as they have done a better job of selling class warfare (rich vs. poor) and convincing the 'working class' that the government is the answer to everything when compared to the Republican belief that less governemnt is better.  The Democrats message sells better if you don't dig into it, so it would win.  Count me as one of the yays on the legitimacy of the election.  I have no idea on the commission.  Who was supposed to running it?
i'm willing to say i'm sorta for clark.
i just went to comfort last night!  were you there too?
JFK and Clinton both had much more political experience than Edwards.  If Edwards was on his second term in the senate instead of his first, then maybe we would be talking presidential hopes here.  he's too inexperienced.
I just found a strange contraption called Beagle II on my roof.  Should I tell someone?  About the militarisation of space, I agree with John that it looks like being inevitable at this point - not that I think we should be happy with that.  That NASA is the mechanism via which the public can be made to fund military research is nothing new, either.  Most high technology, from telecoms to nuclear weapons, is a result of public subsidies. The main  raison d'etre  of the Pentagon system was to set up this system. Once the public has paid the cost, the technology gets turned over to private enterprise to collect the profits (I believe the term for this is 'free enterprise').  And if the private enterprise gets in trouble, the public bails them out. Yay! Risk-free capitalism!   We have satellites and computers because the Pentagon and NASA covered for it (in the US - we have our own versions too, of course.  I think Alan Turing got military funding, for instance, although don't quote me.). These things are now profitable, so they get handed over to big private corporations.  This is an open secret - it's not talked about much in public, since most people don't like it when they realise they're paying to make rich people even richer, and effectively underwriting any risk, but on the other hand it needs to be known in the right sectors because, well, companies have to know where their free money's coming from.  urlLink  'This transfer between public and private industry is called Spinoff at NASA.'   The Bush stealing the election thing...  It's funny how every pro-Bush comment I ever read focuses on ballot-counting and chads, as though those were the most scandalous things going on.  The best book I've read on the Florida debacle is  The Best Democracy Money Can Buy .  Honestly, I didn't even think it was controversial to say he stole it, but the front page of today's Independent says that 54 per cent of Americans believe he was legitimately elected.  What's your impression in the belly of the beast?  Also, can anyone point me to the investigative commission that concluded it was stolen?   urlLink Greg Palast  told me about it, but we were interrupted as he was telling me where to find it and I haven't had much luck searching online.  Hope you're all well.
Julie was watching 'I Want to Marry Ryan Banks' on ABC Family last night.  I walked by at one point and saw the female star and it took me a second to realize that it was Emma Caufield (Anya).  She was definitely not the dumb naive character she was in Buffy.
I've been for Kerry from the beginning.  I think my current state of unemployment is (for now) my own strategic choice.  I think venturing from this planet is the only thing of value that our species can do.  I remain conflicted about the invasion and occupation of Iraq.  I miss Buffy, though I realize the show had nowhere else to go.  'Lost in Translation' remains my favorite film of last year.  I am excited about the semester beginning today, though I wish I had more time for gaming.  'Comfort' on the 200(?) block of Broad is a fantastic restaurant.  And I love Angie!
Wow.  What happened to Dean?  I guess his angry-all-the-time approach did not resonate well with Iowans.  I'm actually most scared of Edwards at this point.  He is young, energetic, and charismatic - traits similar to JFK and Clinton(shudder).  It is too early for me to get into analyzing their politics since they will change 100 times between now and the convention.  Who is the favorite amongst my Bush hating friends?
it's okay john - you're still my #1 paladin.
Sorry Mir, the attack the the post thing was me thinking out loud to myself, not aimed at you or anybody else.  Just another example of how this medium fails to convey meanings at time.
john, i'm not trying to attack the poster,i'm merely stating a point.  i used people from the blogger as examples because we are familiar with them and encourages more participation from others on the blog.  so i just like to talk politics - i'm really not trying to offend anyone. but beyond that - 29,000 is rich - if you are single with no dependents, and if you keep in mind the current poverty level for one person caps out at 9,000.  yes, that's right, fellow bloggers - if you make 9,001 dollars - no matter where you live - you are not considered poor by the federal government. and yes, you are right, a good deal of economics, as well as most things, are cyclical - however, the acts of the president and congress can determine how long those cycles last.
Ben - I wasn't referring to her physical whereabouts.  I knew that she had been at FSU at some point recently.  I was merely referring to her presence on the blog (and in the e-mail ring prior to that) and therefore seeing my previous comments on the 2000 election.  As for the political differences, I guess I have never really felt that I have seen your opinions.  I have seen the links you post on the political issues, but I don't take that as necessarily that you agree 100% with them.  Much like if I was to post a link to the Weekly Standard or New Republic or whatever one of the conservative rags are, I doubt you would find that I agree with it 100%.  It also sounds like you feel like I did from the moment Clinton took office and declared me, a fresh college graduate making $29,000 a year to be rich.  From that moment on, I wanted that man out of office and would strongly argue against anything he said.  Miriam - I can't respond to most of your post without seriously offending some people personally, and I do not want to that.  Argue and attack the points, not the poster, so I won't.  The economy is a cyclical thing.  We had about 10 years of positive growth from the early 80's to early 90's, then a recession, then about 6-7 years of positive growth from 93-94 to early 2000.  It will happen again.
john: there's so much i could say in response to your post, but i can only explain my outrage at the current state of affairs so many times; maybe nick will jump in with some thoughts.  you don't see things the way i do in regards to politics, and you probably never will.  but i have to wonder if to some degree we're just talking about how we feel about the facts, rather than the facts themselves.    regardless, i will say this:  you are wrong about my sister's whereabouts in november of 2000.  she was at ground zero, my friend - living in florida, witnessing firsthand much of the foolishness that went on there.
john -  just on this point, i think we are no where near having a fully recovered economy, which of course, does not mean 0% unemployment, but it does mean that well-paying professional jobs are available for those who have the skills and education to acquire them.   eva - undergrad biology - unemployed.  ben - underemployed.  me - ba - contract work.   etc. etc. etc. - yes, we could all go out today and get a minumum wage job and barely scrape by and pay most of our bills.  but is that the american dream now?  get your education, work hard, and then stay around the poverty line due to a stalled economy?   what happened to all of the perks of full time employment?
yes, i lifted this quote from dear abby, but what the hey: In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., whose birthday we remember today: 'To retaliate in kind would do nothing but intensify the existence of hate in the universe. Along the way of life, someone must have sense enough, and morality enough, to cut off the chain of hate.'
'The space program is bullshit.' - Don't hold back, tell us how you really feel!  ;)  Seriously though, is it the whole space program or just this latest decision/pronouncement you don't like?  We have and continue to enjoy the after effects of the initial Apollo missions with the spin off technologies.  I don't see that we will have the same boost as we got in the 60's from this, but that is the great thing about technology - you don't know about something useful until someone invents it.  '...the fact that over 9 million Americans (including myself) are unemployed...' - What exactly makes someone unemployed?  Is my wife unemployed?  She has no paying job but also does not want one right now.  Is she included in those statistics?  What about the artist/actor who does not have a job because they are busy trying to get a part or find a patron?  They could at least respond to any of the fast food restaurants that always have 'Now Hiring' signs out front.  Are they included?  9 out of roughly 250 is 4%, which I think is lower than the rates I had heard (~6%), so it makes my wonder even more as to exactly how they come up with the numbers.  It just proves the saying that there are three types of information - lies, damn lies, and statistics.  Note that I am not saying that we don't have too much unemployment.  I would love for there to be 0%, but short of the government hiring anyone without a job to do something, I don't think the government has the responsibility or even power to do anything about it.  '...our economy has continuously gone downhill ...' - The economic downturn/recession/depression/dip/or whatever the hell you want to call it began noticeably in March of 2000 when the stock market went through its 'correction' (I hate that term, but that's what they call it).  The NASDAQ went from 5000 to 2000 in something like 6 weeks and the NYSE had a similar drop, taking down many peoples retirement and college education savings with it.  A friend of mine stupidly was holding the money he had made from the sale of his house in NASDAQ and watched it get reduced to about 1/4 of the original amount.  Let's see, I believe that in March of 2000, Governor Bush was trying to secure the Republican nomination for the White House.  And let's see, yeah I can see where President Bush was directly responsible for allowing the terrorist attacks that lead to the deaths of ~3,300 people, shaking our country to it's core, and causing an already weak economy to weaken further.  But the really bad news for the argument is that the economy has grown for the last two quarters and the highest rates in 20 years.  '...Bush stole the presidency...' - Sigh.  Miriam, help me out here.  How many times have I addressed this one in the last 3 years?  20?  I know that Eva was not here for them, so I will state my response again.  There are laws in place in every state that govern the way public elections are to be held.  They were followed in Florida, but Al Gore wanted to change them so that the ballots would be counted again (making three times if I remember correctly).  Bush appealed to the State Supreme Court, which upheld the decision to go ahead and recount.  Bush then appealed to the US Supreme Court, who finally voted 5-4 to stop the recounts and declare a winner based on the votes counted.  The Democrats cried foul and this was partisan politics.  If it had truly been partisan, the vote would have been 7-2, as that is the breakdown of R vs. D appointees.  What that showed to me was that the court was deeply divided, but made a ruling and it was carried out without the violence that probably would have occurred in other countries.  The Democrats keep bringing up the 500,000 more votes that Gore received.  If our system of elections was based on straight count, then that would be a valid point.  But, since the US Constitution clearly spells out the Electoral College process, it does not matter.  What the Democrats should be doing is trying to shore up support in the states where they were close, transferring the popular vote to electoral votes and possibly a White House win (shudder).  As a side note, one or two of the Florida newspapers went back after the fact and counted the ballots.  There was a slight change in the numbers, but Bush still won the state by some ridiculously close margin (around 200 votes).  '...(1)poorly thought out, and (2)expensive, (3)publicity stunt.' - (1) I don't think it is poorly thought out.  All that he has done is to set a target.  Was Kennedy's proclamation poorly thought out in 1961?  (2) Yes it will be  (3)  Probably so.  But then again, anytime a President announces something, it can probably be considered a publicity stunt or at the very least politically motivated (see the recent immigration announcement)  'He's just cutting funding and jobs from other NASA programs. '  - Would you rather he keep funding them and come up with the money from, say, Medicare?  Will any of those people, say working on the Space Shuttle, be able to transfer to the new programs?  I would hope so.  I found out with some dismay this weekend that Sean O'Keefe (NASA administrator) announced that the next HST maintenance mission has been scrubbed.  The current gyros have a 50% chance of failing in the next year and 75% within the next two years.  Once they go, Hubble will not be usable.  Additionally, the mission was going to boost it into a higher orbit.  Without this, it sounds like Hubble will reenter the atmosphere sometime in the next 2-4 years.  The replacement telescope is not scheduled to be launched until 2008-2011.   Congratulations on the upcoming wedding.

The space program is bullshit.  It might be a fun and cool distraction from the fact that over 9 million Americans (including myself) are unemployed, our economy has continuously gone downhill since Bush stole the presidency, and that we are in the middle of a big screw up in Iraq, but it is a poorly thought out, and expesive, publicity stunt.  Go USA!  Since we have so few problems, let's spend time and money on messing up another planet.  The thing that I find the funniest is the way Bush plans to fund it.  He's just cutting funding and jobs from other NASA programs.   In other news, I need everyone's address so I can eventually send out wedding invitations.  It's going to be on August 14th.  The ceremony will be at Maymont and the reception will be at my parents' house.  You should all come.  We're going to have lots and lots of booze.  Oh...and if anyone likes doing hard physical labour and has free time, I've got plenty for you!  Just call me and let me know!
Ben - If that was intended as a response to my question, it failed.  I'm not asking what an anti-Bush website thinks about it, I'm asking what my fellow bloggers think about it.  In response to the website, for us, the USA, to think that space will remain unmilitarized forever is naive.  Especially since out good buddies in the Peoples Republic of China are rapidly developing their own space program, and I believe have announced plans for a moon mission (though my memory is vague on that).  They see us as a threat, rightly or wrongly, and we must be prepared.  Someone told me that space exploration is alot like having kids; if you wait until you are ready, it will never happen.  I can see his point.  We, the human species, have been trying to solve some of these pressing social problems (poverty, injustice) for about 3000 years now.  Sometimes with good effects (Roman and Greek rule was pretty good) and sometimes with bad (medieval Europe).  If we wait until the social problems are solved, then I don't think we will ever do it.
MISSION TO MARS FOR MILITARY BENEFIT, NOT JUST 'SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY'  President Bush unveiled his proposal for a new space program Wednesday by invoking the spirit of explorers Lewis and Clark, saying, 'They made that journey in the spirit of discovery... America has ventured forth into space for the same reasons.'   But the president didn't mention that members of his administration view space as the next frontier for military buildup and conquest.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld chaired the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization four years ago, releasing its findings in January 2001. Rumsfeld's report found that 'we know from history that every medium -- air, land and sea -- has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different.'  The panel also concluded that 'given this virtual certainty, the [United States] must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space.'  The president's focus on space exploration because it 'improves our lives, and lifts our national spirit.' However, behind the scenes, USA Today reported that Bush was persuaded to move forward in part due to the military benefits, as promoted to him by Vice President Cheney.   The Center for American Progress' Progress Report yesterday noted an appearance by Republican Congressman Tom Feeney on Scarborough Country where he stated, 'Somebody is going to dominate space.  When they do, just like when the British dominated the naval part of our globe, established their empire, just like the United States has dominated the air superiority, ultimately, whoever is able to dominate space will be able to control the destiny of the entire Earth.'  Feeney's comments echo PNAC's September 2000 report Rebuilding America's Defenses, which said, 'Much as control of the high seas - and the protection of international commerce defined global power in the past, so will control of the new 'international commons' be a key to world power in the future.'    urlLink -Bush Aims for Mars to Dominate Space Militarily
Thanks Mir, I was starting to wonder if I had fallen into an alternate reality where we agreed on things!  I am having fun watch the Democrats tear at each other in Iowa.  Now that Dean has abandoned his no attacking policy, I wonder how long it will be before Edwards does as well.  I am also curious as to why Wes Clark is spending so much money on TV ads in Virginia at this early juncture.  While it is a very good introctory ad, I have seen it enough times now to have a couple of questions about its veracity.  I am not saying that he has lied or even stretched the truth, but I don't think he has put forth the whole truth.  I really doubt that he had much to do with the actually negotiating the peace in Serbia.  He probably had a roll, but we have diplomats to handle these things and soldiers to enforce them.  Also, he comments that this was done without the loss of American lives.  The biggest difference is that we went in to an area where they hate each other (Serbs/Croats) more than they hate us.  In Iraq, the insurgents hate us, not the Shiites/Sunnis.  Yet again, I still have not heard a proposed answer to the situation (other than Dean's saying we need to pull out totally, now).  If you want to lead, you need to have answers, not just point out the obvious problems.
now so john doesn't pass out - a very well thought out ad regarding the presidency of george w  urlLink http://www.liberaloasis.com/bushin41point2.htm
john, i agree with both of your arguments.   i think raising the cigarette tax is ridiculous - it's exploiting citizens who are addicted to a legal product.  they are simply hoping they can keep raising the price but people will keep coming back for more.  i believe drug dealers use the same tactics.   and i don't think we should be going to the moon or mars.  we have a huge deficit - we're in the middle of a very expensive war - and we have alot of domestic programs which need funding -  so go john!
When I first heard that President Bush was going to propose going back to the Moon, I will admit that I was extremely skeptical on the reasoning.  We've been to the moon, kicked around the dust, and gotten the t-shirt.  What's the point?  I wanted there to be a larger goal - Mars.  So, I was initially happy about the recent announcement.  But, the more I think about, the more I question it.  Don't get me wrong, I still am in favor of it, but I'm not sure that we will see the benefits of the initial establishment of the NASA with all the new technology, which is what everyone in NASA seems to be touting as a reason to do this.  Computers are already improving at a rate that puts them ahead of the software designed to tax them.  We are constantly developing new and better materials (plastics, polymers, ceramics) and other electronics.  I don't see where the demands of this new mission are going to have much trickle down into daily society.  Sure, there will be localized job benefits to the areas that get work on certain aspects of the project, but unless we get our kids back where they should be in math and science, those jobs will go non-Americans.  So, I am in support of the mission, with some reservations.  How about the rest of the blog?
Warning - The following post is given a grade of F for political correctness because it is anti-tax, and somewhat pro-smoker.  I have been listening to the governor talk about the need to overhaul our state tax system.  The one that troubles me most is the increase to the cigarette tax.  I have heard that Virginia has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, tax per pack.  That seems to be the overwhelming reason given to raise it.  If the revenue generated from this increase was to go directly to treating the illnesses of smokers with no reduction in the current amounts going there (i.e. an increase in actual spending), I would not have a problem with it.  But, I have observed politicians long enough to know that this will not be the case.  I point to the Virginia Lottery as my case in point.  When we (the voters) were sold on the concept of a lottery, we were told that all the profits would go to education.  The good news is that the politicians held true to their word for once.  The bad news is that the amount of money that had been coming from the general fund has dropped dramatically.  Basically, they used the lottery to fund something that everyone agrees needs it, in order to be able to increase some other programs.  I do not doubt that our current politicians would do the same thing with a cigarette tax.  Now, if they are just trying to raise more general revenue, this is also not a good idea.  I point to New York City as an example for this one.  They recently, within the last 2 years, raised the per pack tax to some astronomical level, like $5 a pack.  This was intended to help ease their budget problems.  Instead, they ended up with a larger deficit than before because all this revenue failed to appear.  The reason?  Smokers, despite there lack of heeding the warnings of the danger, aren't stupid.  They know that they can go someplace else to get their cigarettes and have done so.  Heck, I'm sure that some entrepreneurs did the math and realized that they could make several trips to Virginia, load up on lots of cartons, and took them back to New York where they sold them for a hefty markup but still less than the 'legal' packs.  The bottom line, to me anyway, is that getting whatever amount we get now is better than gambling that we won't lose more by raising the rates.  I know that Julie's parents get many cartons to take back to Florida whenever they pass through because of the price difference.  They aren't the only ones.  If you raise the rate, much of this business will dry up.
Congratulations Miriam.  I was a little shocked to see that guy in what appears to be a serious movie.  I guess he is trying to expand beyond 'That 70s Show' and 'Dude, Where's My Car?'  Ben - Good article.  I did notread 100% of it (got a Cliff Notes version?) , but it reinforced my apprehension about Wal-Mart.  What I did not see it mention was what Wal-Mart has done to the smaller niche businesses.  You know, the ones like a bike shop or small fabric store or even an independent drug store (as versus CVS or Wal-Greens).  Do you recall the huge fight that Ashland put up against the Wal-Mart opening there?  It was very big news when they one, but the victory was only temporary.  The Wal-Mart is now open.  I have not heard how it has affected the small businesses in Ashland.  On the flip side, I am hypocritical for criticizing them.  With one salary and 5 mouths to feed, Julie does 80+% of our shopping at Wal-Mart, in part because of price and because of the convenence of going to one store and getting everything we need.  A recent trip included soap, diapers, an oil filter, and a gallon of milk.  There's not too many stores that have all four of those items

a quote that john might appreciate: from the village voice: Just before I go to sleep I ask myself, Why not love your fellow man, why not peace on earth? In the morning the sun has risen over the enormous Coral Ridge shopping mall, the biggest in Iowa. And the shoppers from Iowa City and Cedar Rapids are pulling in like ants returning to a hill. I ask myself the same question, Why not peace on earth? And the answer occurs to me immediatelybecause the other guy wants to rape your women and kill your children.
the reason i didn't go off about mad cow is because everyone here already knows the risks of eating meat, the opinions that the vegans/vegetarians have, and have already made up their mind.   would i love it if everyone on this blogger became a vegetarian? sure, i would. i would love it if people would just eat meat every 3 days instead of every day. but all i can really do is choose my own actions and hope those actions can help change the minds and hearts of others.
umm, yel, that's me mir not jls.
I am impressed.  It took about a month for one of our vegetarians/vegans to post about Mad Cow.  I would have been spouting off about it the next day.  Then again, I do tend be more rabid then Ben and sometimes Miriam.  As for O'Neill, I am not saying he is lying, or making anything up.  It could all be true.  But, do you really expect him to say nice things about the President who fired him?  I can barely say nice things about the bosses of places where I quit.    Back to my earlier comment about Bush being similar to Reagan (Teflon President), it seems this controversy is already dieing.  Monday and Tuesday it was covered in the first half hour of the Today show (my only brush with network news anymore).  This morning it was not even mentioned.  Another similarity is in one of O'Neill's claims of the President being disengaged during Cabinet meetings.  I seem to recall people saying Reagan was a doddering old fool in his Cabinet meetings.

RTG update:  Having acquired the proof needed to clear themselves of the murder charge, the party accepted an offer from the shadowy K'Sh'Aal to eliminate the would-be crimelord who framed the party.  Given the discovery made after the raid on Grieson's heavily protected auction, it is unclear if the party succeeded.  Meanwhile, Ian and Gregory have decided to return to Tilverton to deliver an altered version of events:  namely, that Castillion died in Shadowdale, when in fact he did not.  On the eve of a rumored message arriving from the East, the party has been invited to join the mysterious Harpers; it is unknown if they will accept.  What is known is that the original fellowship that departed from Tilverton is broken, and that three strangers may be joining the remaining heroes as they take their first steps towards entering the ranks of those who hope to achieve the healing -- or, perhaps, the ultimate restoration -- of Faerun.
Katherine had a blast.  This was the first Christmas where she knew it was coming, so there was some of the childhood excitement around the house.

And poor Julie at home with all three...
I agree.  I also don't understand how someone's sexual preference can lead to such a drastic measure as to make it a constitutional amendment.  Of course barring pedophilia and rape.  It is like saying guys that are attracted to extremely obese women are morally wrong and we should make a constitutional amendment against such practice.  'Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth a nation that will not all the procreation of fat people.'  My whole family would be screwed.  Or rather we wouldn't be screwed.  Depending on how you look at it.
and scott, in my last response, i was not implying that you yourself are a homophobe or anything of the sort.  we all know your favorite words are 'penis' and 'bed'.
thank you for your response scott.  while i can understand being uncomfortable with homosexuality or perhaps even thinking it is something morally wrong, i don't understand how that leads to a constitutional amendment.    sometimes i don't like the direction this country is heading. and btw, i hate ralph nader.
jlg - Barring the religious aspect, I personally believe it comes down to two factors.  Machismo, and comfort.  Ma'cheese'mo - I think some guys are insecure and this is a way for them to be alpha of someone somewhere.  Also, in some cultures, like the Latino culture, it is almost bred into them to be gay haters.  And since that particular culture tends to be heavily Catholic....but we aren't going the religion route.  Comfort - If you are raised to believe that *all* dogs are mean killers.  You live 50 years of your life thinking that every dog you ever see is mean, and wants to kill you (versus nice and wants to kill you ;-p ).  Then, it is going to be very hard to accept a dog in your life when you turn 51.  Same with gay marriage.  If you believe that it is 'wrong' simply because that is what has been told to you since birth, then it will be hard to accept.

a question for any of you interested - i don't really understand why some individuals have a problem with gay marriage. if someone would like to explain - past the religious arguments, if that could be done - why this opposition towards gay marriage exists?

I agree that it isn't ideology.  I was just tossing that out as a random statement.  As to the press conference, it is the press asking the questions, not either of the two leading candidates.  It is one of the roles of the press to reveal that those in power have feet of clay.  That said, it is also one of the roles of a police force to protect its citizens.  Some police officers reach beyond the originally-intended boundaries, pursuing that end proactively rather than reactively, through violence, profiling, or similiar strategies.  Such acts do not represent a flaw in the role; only in its interpretation and execution.  Likewise, the press occasionally (some would argue frequently) reaches beyond the originally-intended boundaries, in the interpretation and execution of its role.  In both cases, the flaw lies in an unrelated entity that has grafted itself onto, or even assimilated itself into, the original whole:  for the former, that foreign presence might be racism or ideology; for the latter, I would argue that the unwelcome intruder is advertising revenue, of which there is a finite amount, and which is determined by a publisher's ability to make the audience feel equally happy, sad, and superior.  This is not to say that the press is absolved of responsibility; I only add it as a probable explanation.  I don't think that in this situation the press is revealing a flaw in its calling, which I fully support.  Nor do I think that the press is revealing any particular ideological preference.  I think it smells a potentional story, and in its eagerness to get that story placed between lucrative advertising spots that require the largest possible audience, it displays not so much a mindless hunger, but rather an embarassing clumsiness in how it goes about its business.  Case in point:  It displays neither skill nor intelligence to grill someone at a press conference.  This isn't sharp and cunning journalism; it's grandstanding at best, simple rudeness at worst.  Take the potential lead and go snooping around the back doors.  Set out the honey and wait for the flies.  Watching the press conference live on cable yesterday, I was struck only by the mutual train wreck:  journalists behaving like a pack of dogs, and a poor government functionary who made a wrong choice a long time ago and now believes in the empty role he performs.  I still long for clever heroes and cunning villains who deserve respectful cheers and boos.  I am no longer interested in thugs and bullies, no matter what color hat they may wear.
This is not ideology.  This is the Democratic Party trying to find something that will stick when attacking Bush.  Arguing over what happened (or did not happen) 30 years ago is just personal attacks.   The last time I saw such vitriolic hatred (and I think Johnathan, as a neutral observer would agree) of a political figure was the late '90s with the Republicans hating Clinton.  I've got to tell you, it does not do much good.  It doesn't even make you feel good in the long run.  That does not make me ask the question of Ben and Mir (and any other Bush haters), what is it that makes you hate him personally?  And now as I type this, I just heard on Rush of a potential bombshell against Kerry that is being reported on the Drudge report.  Something about recent infidelity.  I have no other information, but, even if it is true, so what?  As long as he did not lie about in the course of federal/state/local investigation, it is between him and his wife.  I saw Edwards on the today show, and even though he did not let the ANG issue totally die, he did say that this election needs to be about much more than attendance records.  Hallelujah!  Now if BOTH sides will let that happen, we might get to have civil discussions about our disagreements on the issues (taxes, spending, education, defense, etc.)
Ideology is terribly boring.
While quite a few pages still appear to be missing from the 1972 chapter of President Bushs National Guard duty in Texas and Alabama, at least a few of them may have been accounted for on Wednesday -- though not exactly in support of the administrations case that Bush fulfilled his service obligations. The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday that some of Bushs Guard files may have been intentionally dumped ahead of his presidential run in 2000:   Retired National Guard Lt. Col. Bill Burkett said Tuesday that in 1997, then-Gov. Bushs chief of staff, Joe Albaugh, told the National Guard chief to get the Bush file and make certain theres not anything there that will embarrass the governor.   Col. Burkett said that a few days later at Camp Mabry in Austin, he saw Mr. Bushs file and documents from it discarded in a trash can. He said he recognized the documents as retirement point summaries and pay forms.

I recommend picking up the bootleg DVDs of the original movies at a con like Shore Leave.  I was quite pleased with Ep4, and will buy the other two this year (should the vendor return).  The only minor quibble is that it pauses briefly at four places where the laser disc has to be turned over...but a small sacrifice to enjoy the movie I actually saw.  For the record, I'll be happy to buy discs for others who provide the cash beforehand.

I was referring to the behavior of Moderates.  As to for whom I will vote, I'd rather discuss that in another forum.  Voting here on the Blog has little meaning, and results in an endless Tastes Great / Less Filling loop.  Though I am amused at the panic inspired by the possibility that I might vote for Bush.  In fact, the panic was so delighful that now I won't say anything more about it at all, just so I can enjoy the chaos.
JLS, if you're part of the aforementioned 'on the fence' Moderate group, does that mean you're seriously considering voting for Bush?  or were you referring to the primaries, and not the november election.
But the choir feels an obligation to be there.  The congregation doesn't.  Try again, Analogy Girl.
to use a church analogy:  if you can't inspire the choir, there's no way you're going to convince the congregation.
Neither Conservatives nor Liberals need to be stirred up.  As ideologues, they already are.  The only people that need stirring are Moderates.  You're choosing your candidates as if you're worried about getting the readers of The Nation to vote in November.  They're not your problem.  It's those of us in the middle, who hold both extremes suspect.  There's enough discontent among us for either ideology to work with.  We're the only audience that counts.  Sell it to us, or lose.
hey, sometimes you gotta realize you betted on the wrong horse and be ready to move.  i'm for the person who can beat bush and heck, if you can't even stir up the democratic party then you can't win the national election.

seem like good and legitimate questions to me - anyone disagree or agree?  Joe Conason's Journal On Sunday, NBC's Tim Russert is scheduled to interview the president. Here are five questions he'll definitely want to ask.  Editor's note: This will be the last daily installment of Joe Conason's Journal. Beginning next week, look for less frequent but more in-depth investigative reports and commentary -- on the Bush administration and other political topics -- from Conason, every week in Salon.  Feb. 5, 2004  |  Tim Russert, dream interviewer  NBC's Tim Russert cherishes a reputation as network television's bulldog interrogator of wayward politicians. His image is good cop/bad cop in the same guy. This coming Sunday, the president will reportedly appear on 'Meet the Press.' That decision may well reflect, as Nick Confessore suggested today, Karl Rove's confidence that Russert isn't really so goddamned tough, especially not on Republicans. If so, Rove would be in rare agreement with many of Russert's critics on the left.   Knowing Russert, I think he would hate to confirm such nasty suspicions when he interviews George W. Bush (although he would also hasten to plead that some partisans on both sides are never satisfied, etc.). Let's help him with a few questions (and follow-ups) that nobody could call softballs:      1. Given the controversy about your attendance record during your National Guard service, Mr. President, perhaps the best way to resolve matters would be to authorize the release of all of your military records, including pay stubs, Social Security records and so-called retirement-points records. Will you do that? If not, why not, and how can the American people believe that you actually fulfilled your service obligations as everyone else in the Guard was required to do?   2. Mr. President, on page 54 of your autobiography, 'A Charge to Keep,' you wrote: 'I continued flying with my unit for the next several years.' But the truth is that you quit flying after less than two years, despite fighter training that cost the taxpayers almost a million dollars. Did your superiors approve your decision to quit flying, or did you just quit on your own? Weren't you suspended from flying in August 1972 after you failed to take a required physical exam? Why didn't you take that physical?     3. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the now-famous 'mission accomplished' speech you gave on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln outside San Diego last May. You landed on the carrier in a flight suit -- a piece of videotape shown around the world. [Roll tape.] A lot of your critics were appalled by that image. Here's a man who never fought in a war, never saw the danger and horrors of real combat, dressing up like a soldier and proclaiming a victory that, as it turned out, we were far from accomplishing. As you look back on it, has it ever occurred to you, that Eisenhower, who won D-day, never dressed in uniform when he was president; John F. Kennedy, who was a genuine war hero, never dressed in uniform either. Was there something disrespectful to the military in a costume stunt like that? Your thoughts, sir.   4. You have blamed the rapidly rising, unsustainable federal deficits on 'out-of-control' domestic spending. But Mr. President, the plain fact, according to every nonpartisan analyst, is that your tax cuts are responsible for a far greater percentage of present and future deficits than spending. Your current budget proposal cuts billions in programs for children and veterans. Wouldn't it be more compassionate -- and more responsible -- to rescind some of the tax breaks for the very wealthiest Americans?   5. Sir, with respect, most economists say that the tax cuts are responsible for no more than 20 percent of the recent economic growth, and that the recession could have been addressed with a short-term stimulus primarily aimed at middle- and working-class tax payers, rather than long-term tax cuts tilted toward the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. These long-term tax cuts for the wealthy are the major cause for these massive structural deficits that we now have and the complete inability to fund some of these programs for children, the elderly and veterans. How does that reflect responsible Republicanism or compassionate conservatism?   You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.

i just lost my job at vcu - for being sick  - life is soooo not fair.
i have to call eva haley - i've been sick for the last 2 days so i have an excuse!  but don't worry mizz haley, i's be calling you soon!
john, my only response is that i don't know why either.  i really don't know much about the human body or the practice of medicine.  i have the tendency to go with the idea that medical decisions should be left to doctors and their patients - not to the government.
Do the letters on here appear itty-bitty to anyone else?  I just had to cut and paste everything into Word so that I could read it.
However, it was clear to me that the bustier cup was popped off very close to the last downbeat of the song, leading me to believe it was intentional.  Regardless of the current debate, I will offer that I'm personally very grateful that Miss Jackson has helped our nation to move beyond the shock and awe that was the Madonna/Britney kiss.  At last, we can finally heal.
A fair question; one for which I have no answer.  Miz Scahlett, I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' no babies.
Before I get to my question, let me preface this by saying that I am not trying to start an argument or change anyone's mind on this issue, because I know that there is nothing that I can say to do so and there is nothing any of you can say to change my mind.  Today a federal judge ruled a Virginia law passed last year (I think) outlawing the so called partial birth abortion procedure as unconstitutional.  I don't know the specifics of his ruling or what the law says, and that is not my question.  What I do not understand is under what situation is the pregnant woman's life in danger enough to end the pregnancy but not enough that it is 'safe' to undergo as much of the birth process as this does.  I use safe in quotes because nothing about the birthing process is without danger.  As much as doctors know, they still don't understand all the vagaries of child birth.  Please don't respond with a flame, because I have not desire to argue this issue, merely to have someone fill me in on something I may be missing about this particular procedure.

Despite President Bush's pledge that homosexuals 'ought to have the same rights' (1) as all other people, his Administration this week ruled that homosexuals can now be fired from the federal workforce because of their sexual orientation.  According to the Federal Times, the president's appointee at the Office of Special Counsel ruled that federal employees will now 'have no recourse if they are fired or demoted simply for being gay.' (2)   While the Bush Administration says it is legally prohibited from firing a person for their conduct, they have the legal right to fire or demote someone based on their sexual orientation. To carry out the directive, the White House has begun removing information from government websites about sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. (3)  Not only does the new directive contradict the president's own promise to treat homosexuals as equals under the law, but it also contradicts what the Administration told Congress. As noted in a bipartisan letter from four Senators to the Administration, 'During the confirmation process [of the president's appointee], you assured us that you were committed to protecting federal employees against unlawful discrimination related to their sexual orientation.'

An excellent example of doublethink in modern society is the  urlLink war on drugs .

Yet, we have almost the exact same situation today with war on drugs, yet most people think that our modern prohibition is a good idea ... and more than that, they believe that anybody that thinks that the war on drugs isn't a good idea must be completely out of their minds. In order for a person to be effective at doublethink, they must master the art of  crimestop .   crimestop:  (Orwell's definition) 'The faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought.

why isn't truth fact?
While I personally understand that there is a difference between truth and fact, I nevertheless have a huge problem with it.  Within myself, I vehemently want truth to be fact.  It's my Utopia, if you will.
And now for something completely different.   urlLink Asteriod Acquitted?   and   urlLink Two new finds.
My take on the whole 'saving people' thing, speaking as a Christian, is that I feel as though the best way to convey my beliefs to others is to live as an example of them.   To me, the true message of Christ was one of inclusivity, understanding, compassion, forgiveness, and above all, love.  And being a Christian to me means living a life that is 'Christ-like.'  Though I know that I am by no means without sin, the most important thing for me is to live my life with love and compassion to the best of my human ability.  As for the film...  I have yet to see it.  I think I'd prefer to see it privately in my own home, because my faith is very strong and very personal to me.  I feel like I might leave the film feeling like an open wound, and I don't want to risk being around insensitivity at a moment like that...  But as for the way it is marketed...  The movie business is still just that...a business.  It is an unfortunate reality that, if you want to put asses in seats, you have to have some sort of draw.  Since James Caviezel is not yet an A-List celebrity (though I think he could be...he's a brilliant actor), his name alone is not enough.  And while many people love Mel Gibson, the masses of asses in seats tend to prefer a Mel that is in front of the camera, not behind it.  So producers, wanting to make money on a film that they know is monetarily risky, come up with a way to sell the film, i.e., 'the TRUE story of WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.'  Whether or not it is historically accurate does not matter to me.  As Harmonium touched upon, truth and fact are not synonymous.  After the release of 'The Killing Fields,' director Roland Joffe asked one of the journalists, on whose experiences the film was based, if the film was accurate.  He replied with a yes and no.  No, he said, that's not exactly what really happened.  But yes, he said, that's exactly what it  felt  like.
this unemployed thing is starting to suck.
I know plenty of Christians that don't try to 'save' me, and I, in most cases, think more highly of them and I do of the ones that are trying to 'save' me.  Wouldn't it serve you more to target people that might actually want to be in your group rather than those that absolutely don't want to be?  I know they will receive a higher number of virgins in the kingdom of god if they convert a true nonbeliever, but at what point do you cross the line from being zealous to being a public nuisance?!
your faith in the chair is based on past experiences of sitting in a chair and it not falling apart.  if you were to be concerned every time this event occurred, you would have serious issues.  what these ladies were suggesting you have is 'blind' faith.  faith in something even though you have no evidence to support it - no previous experiences to draw from.  what you could assume, if it would make you less angry, is that these women believe with all of their heart, that their goal in life is to save you and if they don't, you will be suffering eternal torment.  hard for them to deal with, i'm sure.  they are just doing what they think is best.  i don't mind the proselytizers - as long as they don't try to change the laws of our secular government.
On a side note about 'faith'...  This past weekend, two ladies came to my door.  After greetings were passed, one promptly asked me, and I paraphrase, 'Do you think you are going to Heaven when you die?'.  My response was a prompt but polite 'No.'.  They appeared shocked and asked me why.  I said that you can't go someplace that doesn't exist.  I explained that I am an atheist, and I believe that 'there is no god, or satan, or heaven, hell'.  And their response was, 'but you have to have faith in that, right?'  She went on to say that when you sit in a chair, do you thoroughly inspect it first, or do you just go and sit down?  Meaning that you have to have faith that the chair will support you, and won't fall apart.  My question is this....Since when did religion trademark the word 'faith' as only pertaining to ones belief in a deity of some sort.  Why is it that if I have faith, then I must in some way or another believe in god?  No offense to the christians out there, but it really pissed me off.
...and that's what bugged me enough to post; that the film maker went out of his way to make the film 'historically accurate', but then dropped the ball on the color issue.  regardless of one's opinion on Jesus' ethnicity (or at least, that of people living in the Middle East during the time period he supposedly lived in), the actors could have at least been a  little  darker skinned - they all lived in a desert, for pete's sake!  you could have had a chinese guy playing christ in a snowstorm, as long as you didn't expect me to look at your film as a depiction of how the people and places 'really looked', which is what gibson's film purports to do (and succeeded in doing in many other ways, apparently).  but is that really the point when you're telling 'the greatest story ever told'?  shouldn't even a pretty good story be able stand on its own, in regards to its message(s)?  shakespeare's plays can be set in any time period, and they work fine; no one balks at the inevitable 'anachronisms', because his were universal stories from the get-go.  i wish more christians would do the same, by acknowledging the power of allegory to promote faith and belief, rather than insisting that the events in their stories have to have 'really happened' to be significant.    it doesn't matter if jesus ever really existed, anymore than odysseus or buddha or any number of characters in the great stories of our species; what matters is the message, not the messenger (or the creed).  what we learn about  ourselves  in reading about these folk is what matters.  in another thousand years, all of them will have been modified tenfold to suit the cultures and opinions of times to come, just as they have been many times before.  hopefully, the essence of the stories will persist and prevail - and not because we ever felt the need to prove that they 'really happened', which is all but impossible, and in my opinion, needless.
For myself, the historicity of a representation of a figure such as Jesus or the Buddha is completely irrelevant.  What matters to me are the words and the act(s).  My own research has revealed that Gibson intended to film an interpretation, albeit one that is more 'gritty' and 'violent.'  In that sense -- and in that sense only -- it seems that the film can be tested against realism.  In terms of event and image, it is, like all films, a personal visual exploration.  As Ebert often says, a movie is not about what it is about, but how it is about it.  As a sidenote, there is a curious need in modern society to equate 'veracity' with 'truth,' as if they have anything at all to do with each other.  At least once a year, a newsmagazine devotes a cover story to the 'real Jesus,' the 'real Muhammed,' the 'real Whoever' -- as if evidence matters in the search for truth.  Evidence yields nothing but data.  Data has its uses, and for many from the 18th century Enlightenment onward, its presence can evoke deep satisfaction -- but in the great cocktail party of the universe, beyond nodding to each other at the cheese table, data and faith have very little to talk about.
I'm mixed on this aspect of the film.  While it is Mel Gibson's right to create a film with his own artistic vision, it then comes down to whether the film is being done with a heavy influence of historical accuracy OR simply being made from ones own interpretation of an event.  This picture seems to be made as the latter.  And like Harmonium said, I don't have a problem with that.  But you can't also try and market that same product as being historically accurate, when it just isn't.....if indeed that is what is being done.
The visuals are inspired by Medieval artwork and iconography, a stylistic choice.  I have no problem with that.
It is quite likely that Jesus was a 'white guy'.  Now he probably didn't look like he was from Sweden, but rather he looked more like a modern day Middle Easterner.  Like Iraqis, Pakistanis, Israelis, etc.  And yes, they are considered Caucasians.  As far as the movie is concerned, and no I haven't seen it, I've heard that they don't have a single black person in the movie.  Now I find that almost impossible to believe that back then being that close to Africa that not a single black person was present in that city during that time.
i was almost curious enough about 'the passion' to give a look.  i was intrigued by the desire on gibson's part for historical accuracy on depicting the time period in which the story is set; the sets, the costumes, even the language - a film in aramaic, of all things!    then i checked out the  urlLink official site  for the film.  jesus christ is played by a white guy, as is most of the cast.  wtf.

well, i guess you have to ask out of the scientific establishment how many support it and why and also, are the scientist opposed to this idea being funded by people/corporation who would benefit from that point of view.  from what i understand global warming is accepted by the majority of reputable scientists and it has been said that christine whitman was fired from the epa because of her wanting to publish information about global warning.
Absolutely not.  Just that before we go making radical changes, that in this case seem more aimed at punishing succesful countries than remedying what may be happening, we should analyze things in a little bit more detail.  There are scientists that say global warming is happening and that we are to blame.  There are scientists saying that global warming is complete bunk.  There are scientists that say global warming may be happening but that it is part of the climatic cycle of this planet.

when i read things like this i don't know whether to laugh or cry: Ga. school evolution debate goes to trial    April 6, 2004  |  ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal judge refused to dismiss a lawsuit against a school district's practice of posting disclaimers inside science textbooks saying evolution is 'a theory, not a fact.'   The Cobb County schools' disclaimer, in the form of a sticker on the inside front cover of textbooks, could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled in ordering the suit to go to trial.     'We're very excited about this,' said attorney Michael Manely, who represents the six Cobb County parents who sued the system in August 2002.   The lawsuit argues that the disclaimer restricts the teaching of evolution, promotes and requires the teaching of creationism and discriminates against particular religions.         The sticker reads: 'This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered.'   The judge weighed the constitutionality of the issue by applying a three-pronged test handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971. In order to get the lawsuit dismissed, the school board had to show that the disclaimer was adopted with a secular purpose; that its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion; and that it does not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion.   In his order signed last Wednesday, Cooper said the school board satisfied him on the first issue.   But he noted that while the disclaimer has no biblical reference, it encourages students to consider alternatives other than evolution. The judge found that the disclaimer could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.   'Indeed, most of the board members concurred that they wanted students to consider other alternatives,' Cooper wrote.   The theory of evolution, accepted by most scientists, says evidence shows current species of life evolved over time from earlier forms and that natural selection determines which species survive. Creationism credits the origin of species to God.   In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled creationism was a religious belief that could not be taught in public schools along with evolution.
sorry - totally out of context - but must do - PAPRIKA!!!! thanks for the info john!
I found some interesting tidbits while researching the election stuff.  Does anyone have a guess when the last time Virginia voted for a Democrat was?  It's not as far off as you might think.  Answer at the bottom.   The first time after reconstruction that Virginia voted for a Republican was 1928 (Herbert Hoover).  It also the first time that a majority of the Confederate states did not vote Democratic.  60 years after the Civil War, they were still holding a grudge against the Republican party for ending slavery.  1964 - LBJ.
For the record, I went back and checked the official FEC results of the 2000 election.  If every single vote cast for Nader had been cast for Gore, which is of course extremely arrogant supposition, then yes, Al Gore would be the president of the United States (shudder),  But, it would not have turned into the landslide that Ms. Randi seems to think it would.  Here's a big surprise (tic).  The areas with the most Nader support were areas that Gore won handily.  The only states in which there would have been a different outcome are Florida and New Hampshire.  The revised total would have been 295-242, the closest since Carter-Ford in 1976 (297-240).  That's a far cry from Nixon-McGovern in 1972 (520-17), Reagan-Carter (489-49), Reagan-Mondale (525-13), Bush-Dukakis (426-111), Clinton-Bush (370-168), or Clinton-Dole in 1996 (379-159).  Some interesting tidbits in reviewing the results- Some states do not allow write in candidtates for president (HI, LA, NE, NV, NM, OK, SC, SD) 3,315 people in Nevada cast a vote for 'None of these candidates' 1 Electoral College member from DC abstained instead of casting his vote for Gore as tradition calls for.  I am guessing that it was some kind of protest statement.

No-Makeup Look Easier To Achieve Than Elle Claims   NEW YORKContrary to claims in the June issue of Elle magazine, the no-makeup look actually requires little effort, a licensed cosmetologist reported Monday.   'The article '20 Minutes To A More Natural You' suggests an application of under-eye concealer, light powder, natural lip gloss, and clear mascara to achieve the makeup-free look,' said Michelle Karns-Daley, spokeswoman for the American Association of Cosmetology. 'But really, a quick shower and a towel-off will do the trick just as well.'   Similarly, experts say Elle's six-page article 'Building Your Self-Esteem' can be more simply stated as 'Stop giving a shit about what other people think.'     Awkward Encounter Not Awkward At All When Masturbated About   OLYMPIA, WAAn uncomfortable exchange between Brad Leydner, 25, and Ginny, the cute redheaded waitress at Hugo's Bistro, lost all awkwardness when envisioned in Leydner's masturbation fantasy later that afternoon.   'So, would you like to grab a coffee after your shift?' a nervous Leydner asked Ginny in both the real and imagined scenarios Monday. 'Oh, Brad, I can't wait four hours to see you. You should fuck me hard, right in this booth,' replied the Dream Ginny moments before Leydner achieved orgasm.   In the fantasy scenario, Ginny did not hide in the kitchen to avoid speaking to Leydner while he paid for his meal.

From: Jms at B5 (jmsatb5@aol.com)   creator of Babylon 5, for those not in the know   Subject: Today We Lost Richard Biggs  Newsgroups:   urlLink rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated   Date: 2004-05-22 16:43:06 PST      I was awakened today with several phone calls from cast members and Doug to pass along the terrible news that this morning, Richard Biggs passed away.    We're still gathering information, so take none of this as firm word, but what seems to have happened, happened quickly.  He woke up, got up out of bed...and went down.  The paramedics who showed up suggested it was either an aneurysm or a massive stroke.  His family members have been informed, and all of the the cast have, as far as we can determine, also been informed.    This is a terrible loss for all of us.  Richard was a consummate professional but more than that he was an honorable, stand-up guy.  If he gave you his word on something, you never had to wonder about it afterward.  He was always helpful and supportive of all the cast, even those who only came in for one episode, always with a ready smile and determined to do whatever it took to make the scene work.  He was, quite simply, a terrific guy, and everyone here is just devastated at the news.  More word as this develops.  We may try to have some kind of fund raiser to help give whatever assistance may be helpful for his kids.  We all miss him terribly.   jms     UPDATE: here's the  urlLink CNN  article concerning his passing.
What does the 0 comments thing mean?
I read on another website that Richard Biggs (Dr. Franklin) died.  Ben, any word on the B5 websites?  It was reported as sudden and unexpected, but no other details.
urlLink Powell Distances Himself From Bush   Powell told Tim Russert on 'Meet the Press' that he had cited intelligence that was provided to the CIA and which he now believes had been deliberately falsified in an effort to win public approval for the war.   Referring to his Feb. 5, 2003 appearance before the U.N.s Security Council, when he argued that Iraq had or was close to developing WMD, including biological weapons, Powell told Russert the information he offered was not only wrong, but that in some cases the intelligence cited by the administration had been purposefully misleading.   'It turned out that the sourcing was inaccurate and wrong and, in some cases, deliberately misleading,' Powell said. 'And for that, I am disappointed and I regret it.'
The long-awaited final Star Wars blockbuster will be called  Birth Of The Empire , movie insiders have revealed.   And the highlight of the space epic will be a thrilling lightsabre clash between Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen)  while surfing on lava .

The sixth movie in the series also features Anakins transformation into evil Darth Vader and his baby son, Luke, being smuggled to safety to the desert planet Tatooine.   The source added: Theres going to be a big announcement soon. Theyve tried lots of titles but the most popular is Birth Of The Empire.   The news has already caused excitement among the legions of Star Wars fans monitoring the films development on the internet.   Star Wars: Episode III is due out next May.

urlLink Woman At Farscape Convention Has Dangerously Inflated Self-Image   &  What Do You Think?  urlLink Iraqi Prisoner Abuse
tom delay is a sick fuck who should be removed from office: ``I saw cruel, sadistic torture,'' said Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif., who added that some of the images were of male prisoners masturbating. She said she saw a man hitting himself against a wall as though to knock himself unconscious.    Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., said he did not see acts of violence, but what appeared to be ``results of acts of violence.''    He said he saw people in body bags and a person with a face ``virtually gone.'' He saw ``people being stitched up above the eyebrow apparently unconscious.''    Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said, ``There were people who were forced to have sex with each other.''    Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., said, ``There were some pictures where it looked like a prisoner was sodomizing himself'' with an object. He said blood was visible in the photograph.    But House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said he thought ``some people are overreacting.''    ``The people who are against the war are using this to their political ends,'' he said.

I was reading a book full of odd trivia the other day.  In it was a list of original movie endings versus what was released in the film.  The one that blew me away was 'Blade Runner'.  According to this book, which supposedly got its info from the producer or director (sorry, I never can keep who does what, but that is a different topic),  Decker is replicant in both the released version and the original version.  Where the hell did that come from?  I have seen the movie at least a half dozen times, but have never thought that.  Am I just way out in la-la land? [avoid the temptation on that one Mir  ;) ]  Did I miss something?

is do we want religion as a part of secular society?  me - i personally don't.  i think religion belongs in churches and in the home and not in the public forum. and i believe this simply because we are a country of diversity - you can believe whatever you want here so there's no way you can generalize religion enough so it appeals to everyone. but do i hate the richmond 'unity' tree.  damn right i do.  it's stupid not to call it a christmas tree.  what, were we just suddenly inspired to put up a tree in december to represent our city unity?  sheesh.  at least call it the 'winter tree'  or the 'holiday tree' or something.

I would just as soon that the issue go away, but it won't.  So, the court just ducked an issue that will be back.  Why not just rule on it and get it over with?  Now, I heard someone speculate that the reason they kicked it back was to smack the 9th Circuit on the hand for letting it get this far 'improperly'.  I don't buy that.  I was surprised when I saw the breakdown of the votes.  I assumed that Scalia and Thomas would have been on the side of not hearing it (for fear of losing the case), but they (and someone else) basically said the case was without merit.
John, Why is this particular issue so important to you?
I cannot believe the Supreme Court used a technicality to avoid hearing the case of 'Under God' in the pledge of allegiance.  This needs to be resolved and will be back in front of the Court in the next year or two.

From Ebert....  'Films like 'The Chronicles of Riddick' gather about them cadres of fans who obsess about every smallest detail, but somehow I don't think 'Riddick' will make as many converts as 'The Matrix.' In fact, I owe an apology to fans of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.    When Richard Roeper reviewed the current two-disc DVD of 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' on TV, I noted that a four-disc set of the movie was coming out later this year. He observed that the complete trilogy will come out on 'an accordion size set that will take up the next six years of your life.' I observed that 'LOTR' fans should 'get a life.' I meant this as an affectionate ironic throwaway, but have received dozens of wounded e-mails from Ring devotees who believe 'LOTR' has, indeed, given them a life, and after seeing 'The Chronicles of Riddick,' I agree. They have a life. The prospect of become an expert on 'Riddick,' in contrast, is too depressing to contemplate.'

the whole article:  urlLink http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A23373-2004Jun7.html   Memo Offered Justification for Use of Torture  Justice Dept. Gave Advice in 2002  By Dana Priest and R. Jeffrey Smith Washington Post Staff Writers Tuesday, June 8, 2004; Page A01    In August 2002, the Justice Department advised the White House that torturing al Qaeda terrorists in captivity abroad 'may be justified,' and that international laws against torture 'may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations' conducted in President Bush's war on terrorism, according to a newly obtained memo.          If a government employee were to torture a suspect in captivity, 'he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the Al Qaeda terrorist network,' said the memo, from the Justice Department's office of legal counsel, written in response to a CIA request for legal guidance. It added that arguments centering on 'necessity and self-defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability' later.   The memo seems to counter the pre-Sept. 11, 2001, assumption that U.S. government personnel would never be permitted to torture captives. It was offered after the CIA began detaining and interrogating suspected al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the wake of the attacks, according to government officials familiar with the document.   The legal reasoning in the 2002 memo, which covered treatment of al Qaeda detainees in CIA custody, was later used in a March 2003 report by Pentagon lawyers assessing interrogation rules governing the Defense Department's detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. At that time, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had asked the lawyers to examine the logistical, policy and legal issues associated with interrogation techniques.   Bush administration officials say flatly that, despite the discussion of legal issues in the two memos, it has abided by international conventions barring torture, and that detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere have been treated humanely, except in the cases of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq for which seven military police soldiers have been charged.   Still, the 2002 and 2003 memos reflect the Bush administration's desire to explore the limits on how far it could legally go in aggressively interrogating foreigners suspected of terrorism or of having information that could thwart future attacks.   In the 2002 memo, written for the CIA and addressed to White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, the Justice Department defined torture in a much narrower way, for example, than does the U.S. Army, which has historically carried out most wartime interrogations.   In the Justice Department's view -- contained in a 50-page document signed by Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee and obtained by The Washington Post -- inflicting moderate or fleeting pain does not necessarily constitute torture. Torture, the memo says, 'must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.'   By contrast, the Army's Field Manual 34-52, titled 'Intelligence Interrogations,' sets more restrictive rules. For example, the Army prohibits pain induced by chemicals or bondage; forcing an individual to stand, sit or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged periods of time; and food deprivation. Under mental torture, the Army prohibits mock executions, sleep deprivation and chemically induced psychosis.   Human rights groups expressed dismay at the Justice Department's legal reasoning yesterday.   'It is by leaps and bounds the worst thing I've seen since this whole Abu Ghraib scandal broke,' said Tom Malinowski of Human Rights Watch. 'It appears that what they were contemplating was the commission of war crimes and looking for ways to avoid legal accountability. The effect is to throw out years of military doctrine and standards on interrogations.'   But a spokesman for the White House counsel's office said, 'The president directed the military to treat al Qaeda and Taliban humanely and consistent with the Geneva Conventions.'

We are here tonight because we love our country.   We are proud of what America is and what it can become.   My fellow Americans: we are here tonight united in one simple purpose: to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.  A great American novelist wrote that you can't go home again.  He could not have imagined this evening.  Tonight, I am home. Home where my public life began and those who made it possible live.  Home where our nation's history was written in blood, idealism, and hope.  Home where my parents showed me the values of family, faith, and country.  Thank you, all of you, for a welcome home I will never forget.   I wish my parents could share this moment.  They went to their rest in the last few years, but their example, their inspiration, their gift of open eyes, open mind, and endless world are bigger and more lasting than any words.  I was born in Colorado, in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital, when my dad was a pilot in World War II.  Now, I'm not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity ward was in?  I'm not making this up.  I was born in the West Wing!  My mother was the rock of our family as so many mothers are. She stayed up late to help me do my homework. She sat by my bed when I was sick, and she answered the questions of a child who, like all children, found the world full of wonders and mysteries.  She was my den mother when I was a Cub Scout and she was so proud of her fifty year pin as a Girl Scout leader. She gave me her passion for the environment.  She taught me to see trees as the cathedrals of nature. And by the power of her example, she showed me that we can and must finish the march toward full equality for all women in our country.   My dad did the things that a boy remembers.  He gave me my first model airplane, my first baseball mitt and my first bicycle.  He also taught me that we are here for something bigger than ourselves; he lived out the responsibilities and sacrifices of the greatest generation to whom we owe so much.    When I was a young man, he was in the State Department, stationed in Berlin when it and the world were divided between democracy and communism. I have unforgettable memories of being a kid mesmerized by the British, French, and American troops, each of them guarding their own part of the city, and Russians standing guard on the stark line separating East from West. On one occasion, I rode my bike into Soviet East Berlin. And when I proudly told my dad, he promptly grounded me.   But what I learned has stayed with me for a lifetime. I saw how different life was on different sides of the same city. I saw the fear in the eyes of people who were not free.  I saw the gratitude of people toward the United States for all that we had done. I felt goose bumps as I got off a military train and heard the Army band strike up 'Stars and Stripes Forever.'  I learned what it meant to be America at our best. I learned the pride of our freedom.  And I am determined now to restore that pride to all who look to America.   Mine were greatest generation parents. And as I thank them, we all join together to thank that whole generation for making America strong, for winning World War II, winning the Cold War, and for the great gift of service which brought America fifty years of peace and prosperity.     My parents inspired me to serve, and when I was a junior in high school, John Kennedy called my generation to service.  It was the beginning of a great journey  a time to march for civil rights, for voting rights, for the environment, for women, and for peace. We believed we could change the world. And you know what? We did.   But we're not finished. The journey isn't complete.  The march isn't over.  The promise isn't perfected.   Tonight, we're setting out again.  And together, we're going to write the next great chapter of America's story.   We have it in our power to change the world again.  But only if we're true to our ideals  and that starts by telling the truth to the American people. That is my first pledge to you tonight.  As President, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.  I ask you to judge me by my record:  As a young prosecutor, I fought for victim's rights and made prosecuting violence against women a priority.  When I came to the Senate, I broke with many in my own party to vote for a balanced budget, because I thought it was the right thing to do.  I fought to put a 100,000 cops on the street.  And then I reached across the aisle to work with John McCain, to find the truth about our POW's and missing in action, and to finally make peace with Vietnam.     I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war.  I will have a Vice President who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws.  I will have a Secretary of Defense who will listen to the best advice of our military leaders.   And I will appoint an Attorney General who actually upholds the Constitution of the United States.   My fellow Americans, this is the most important election of our lifetime. The stakes are high. We are a nation at war  a global war on terror against an enemy unlike any we have ever known before. And here at home, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, and our great middle class is shrinking. People are working weekends; they're working two jobs, three jobs, and they're still not getting ahead.   We're told that outsourcing jobs is good for America. We're told that new jobs that pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost is the best we can do.  They say this is the best economy we've ever had.  And they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist.  Well, here is our answer:  There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better.   We can do better and we will.  We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can do people.  And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt.  We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves  and we can do it again.   So tonight, in the city where America's freedom began, only a few blocks from where the sons and daughters of liberty gave birth to our nation  here tonight, on behalf of a new birth of freedom  on behalf of the middle class who deserve a champion, and those struggling to join it who deserve a fair shot  for the brave men and women in uniform who risk their lives every day and the families who pray for their return  for all those who believe our best days are ahead of us  for all of you  with great faith in the American people, I accept your nomination for President of the United States.   I am proud that at my side will be a running mate whose life is the story of the American dream and who's worked every day to make that dream real for all Americans  Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. And his wonderful wife Elizabeth and their family. This son of a mill worker is ready to lead  and next January, Americans will be proud to have a fighter for the middle class to succeed Dick Cheney as Vice President of the United States.   And what can I say about Teresa?  She has the strongest moral compass of anyone I know. She's down to earth, nurturing, courageous, wise and smart.  She speaks her mind and she speaks the truth, and I love her for that, too. And that's why America will embrace her as the next First Lady of the United States.   For Teresa and me, no matter what the future holds or the past has given us, nothing will ever mean as much as our children. We love them not just for who they are and what they've become, but for being themselves, making us laugh, holding our feet to the fire, and never letting me get away with anything.  Thank you, Andre, Alex, Chris, Vanessa, and John.  And in this journey, I am accompanied by an extraordinary band of brothers led by that American hero, a patriot named Max Cleland.  Our band of brothers doesn't march together because of who we are as veterans, but because of what we learned as soldiers. We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra.  We may be a little older now, we may be a little grayer, but we still know how to fight for our country.   And standing with us in that fight are those who shared with me the long season of the primary campaign:  Carol Moseley Braun, General Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, Bob Graham, Dennis Kucinich, Joe Lieberman and Al Sharpton.   To all of you, I say thank you for teaching me and testing me  but mostly, we say thank you for standing up for our country and giving us the unity to move America forward.   My fellow Americans, the world tonight is very different from the world of four years ago. But I believe the American people are more than equal to the challenge.   Remember the hours after September 11th, when we came together as one to answer the attack against our homeland. We drew strength when our firefighters ran up the stairs and risked their lives, so that others might live. When rescuers rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon.  When the men and women of Flight 93 sacrificed themselves to save our nation's Capitol. When flags were hanging from front porches all across America, and strangers became friends. It was the worst day we have ever seen, but it brought out the best in all of us.    I am proud that after September 11th all our people rallied to President Bush's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats.  There were no Republicans. There were only Americans.  How we wish it had stayed that way.   Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities  and I do  because some issues just aren't all that simple.  Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so.  Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesnt make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so.    As President, I will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence.  I will immediately reform the intelligence system  so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics.  And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to.  I know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can't tell friend from foe.  I know what they go through when they're out on patrol at night and they don't know what's coming around the next bend. I know what it's like to write letters home telling your family that everything's all right when you're not sure that's true.    As President, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war.  Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent in the eye and truthfully say: 'I tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice. We had to protect the American people, fundamental American values from a threat that was real and imminent.'  So lesson one, this is the only justification for going to war.   And on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace.  I know what we have to do in Iraq.  We need a President who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the burden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, and reduce the risk to American soldiers.  That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home.   Here is the reality: that won't happen until we have a president who restores America's respect and leadership -- so we don't have to go it alone in the world.    And we need to rebuild our alliances, so we can get the terrorists before they get us.    I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President.  Let there be no mistake:  I will never hesitate to use force when it is required.  Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security.  And I will build a stronger American military.  We will add 40,000 active duty troops  not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended, and under pressure. We will double our special forces to conduct anti-terrorist operations. We will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save their lives  and win the battle.  And we will end the backdoor draft of National Guard and reservists.  To all who serve in our armed forces today, I say, help is on the way.   As President, I will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal: our economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our firepower.    In these dangerous days there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words. After decades of experience in national security, I know the reach of our power and I know the power of our ideals.  We need to make America once again a beacon in the world. We need to be looked up to and not just feared.    We need to lead a global effort against nuclear proliferation  to keep the most dangerous weapons in the world out of the most dangerous hands in the world.     We need a strong military and we need to lead strong alliances.  And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win.  The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom.    And the front lines of this battle are not just far away  they're right here on our shores, at our airports, and potentially in any town or city. Today, our national security begins with homeland security. The 9-11 Commission has given us a path to follow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans, and the 9-11 families.  As President, I will not evade or equivocate; I will immediately implement the recommendations of that commission.  We shouldn't be letting ninety-five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected.  We shouldn't be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection.  And we shouldn't be opening firehouses in Baghdad and closing them down in the United States of America.   And tonight, we have an important message for those who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for our country.  Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes and ears to the truth, they should remember what America is really all about. They should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives.  Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism.   You see that flag up there.  We call her Old Glory. The stars and stripes forever. I fought under that flag, as did so many of you here and all across our country. That flag flew from the gun turret right behind my head. It was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men I served with and friends I grew up with.  For us, that flag is the most powerful symbol of who we are and what we believe in. Our strength. Our diversity. Our love of country. All that makes America both great and good.   That flag doesn't belong to any president. It doesn't belong to any ideology and it doesn't belong to any political party. It belongs to all the American people.   My fellow citizens, elections are about choices. And choices are about values.  In the end, it's not just policies and programs that matter; the president who sits at that desk must be guided by principle.   For four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans.  Values are not just words.  They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families.   You don't value families by kicking kids out of after school programs and taking cops off our streets, so that Enron can get another tax break.   We believe in the family value of caring for our children and protecting the neighborhoods where they walk and play.    And that is the choice in this election.   You don't value families by denying real prescription drug coverage to seniors, so big drug companies can get another windfall.    We believe in the family value expressed in one of the oldest Commandments: 'Honor thy father and thy mother.'  As President, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And together, we will make sure that senior citizens never have to cut their pills in half because they can't afford life-saving medicine.     And that is the choice in this election.  You don't value families if you force them to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son or daughter in the service, if you deny veterans health care, or if you tell middle class families to wait for a tax cut, so that the wealthiest among us can get even more.  We believe in the value of doing what's right for everyone in the American family.   And that is the choice in this election.   We believe that what matters most is not narrow appeals masquerading as values, but the shared values that show the true face of America.  Not narrow appeals that divide us, but shared values that unite us.  Family and faith.  Hard work and responsibility. Opportunity for all  so that every child, every parent, every worker has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential.  What does it mean in America today when Dave McCune, a steel worker I met in Canton, Ohio, saw his job sent overseas and the equipment in his factory literally unbolted, crated up, and shipped thousands of miles away along with that job?  What does it mean when workers I've met had to train their foreign replacements?    America can do better.  So tonight we say: help is on the way.  What does it mean when Mary Ann Knowles, a woman with breast cancer I met in New Hampshire, had to keep working day after day right through her chemotherapy, no matter how sick she felt, because she was terrified of losing her family's health insurance.   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when Deborah Kromins from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania works and saves all her life only to find out that her pension has disappeared into thin air  and the executive who looted it has bailed out on a golden parachute?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when twenty five percent of the children in Harlem have asthma because of air pollution?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when people are huddled in blankets in the cold, sleeping in Lafayette Park on the doorstep of the White House itself  and the number of families living in poverty has risen by three million in the last four years?    America can do better.  And help is on the way.  And so we come here tonight to ask: Where is the conscience of our country?   I'll tell you where it is: it's in rural and small town America; it's in urban neighborhoods and suburban main streets; it's alive in the people I've met in every part of this land. It's bursting in the hearts of Americans who are determined to give our country back its values and its truth.   We value jobs that pay you more not less than you earned before.  We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, and lift up the quality of your life.  We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better.   So here is our economic plan to build a stronger America:    First, new incentives to revitalize manufacturing.    Second, investment in technology and innovation that will create the good-paying jobs of the future.    Third, close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas.  Instead, we will reward companies that create and keep good paying jobs where they belong  in the good old U.S.A.    We value an America that exports products, not jobs  and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.   Next, we will trade and compete in the world.  But our plan calls for a fair playing field  because if you give the American worker a fair playing field, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against.    And we're going to return to fiscal responsibility because it is the foundation of our economic strength.  Our plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare  and will make government live by the rule that every family has to follow: pay as you go.    And let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.  I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education.   Our education plan for a stronger America sets high standards and demands accountability from parents, teachers, and schools. It provides for smaller class sizes and treats teachers like the professionals they are. And it gives a tax credit to families for each and every year of college.  When I was a prosecutor, I met young kids who were in trouble, abandoned by adults.  And as President, I am determined that we stop being a nation content to spend $50,000 a year to keep a young person in prison for the rest of their life  when we could invest $10,000 to give them Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life.  And we value health care that's affordable and accessible for all Americans.  Since 2000, four million people have lost their health insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it.   You know what's happening. Your premiums, your co-payments, your deductibles have all gone through the roof.  Our health care plan for a stronger America cracks down on the waste, greed, and abuse in our health care system and will save families up to $1,000 a year on their premiums.  You'll get to pick your own doctor  and patients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions.  Under our plan, Medicare will negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And all Americans will be able to buy less expensive prescription drugs from countries like Canada.    The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress.  Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C.  And when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected  it is a right for all Americans.   We value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil.  What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we only have three percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for fifty-three percent of what we consume?    I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation  not the Saudi royal family.   And our energy plan for a stronger America will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future -- so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.  I've told you about our plans for the economy, for education, for health care, for energy independence.  I want you to know more about them.  So now I'm going to say something that Franklin Roosevelt could never have said in his acceptance speech:  go to johnkerry.com.  I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.   My friends, the high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to reject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, group from group, region from region. Maybe some just see us divided into red states and blue states, but I see us as one America  red, white, and blue. And when I am President, the government I lead will enlist people of talent, Republicans as well as Democrats, to find the common ground  so that no one who has something to contribute will be left on the sidelines.  And let me say it plainly: in that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. And whatever our faith, one belief should bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of ourselves for others and for our country.  These aren't Democratic values. These aren't Republican values. They're American values.  We believe in them. They're who we are. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.   So much promise stretches before us. Americans have always reached for the impossible, looked to the next horizon, and asked: What if?   Two young bicycle mechanics from Dayton asked what if this airplane could take off at Kitty Hawk?  It did that and changed the world forever.  A young president asked what if we could go to the moon in ten years?  And now we're exploring the solar system and the stars themselves.  A young generation of entrepreneurs asked, what if we could take all the information in a library and put it on a little chip the size of a fingernail?  We did and that too changed the world forever.  And now it's our time to ask: What if?   What if we find a breakthrough to cure Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and AIDs?  What if we have a president who believes in science, so we can unleash the wonders of discovery like stem cell research to treat illness and save millions of lives?   What if we do what adults should do  and make sure all our children are safe in the afternoons after school?  And what if we have a leadership that's as good as the American dream  so that bigotry and hatred never again steal the hope and future of any American?  I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta with young Americans who came from places as different as Iowa and Oregon, Arkansas, Florida and California.  No one cared where we went to school.  No one cared about our race or our backgrounds. We were literally all in the same boat. We looked out, one for the other  and we still do.   That is the kind of America I will lead as President  an America where we are all in the same boat.   Never has there been a more urgent moment for Americans to step up and define ourselves. I will work my heart out.  But, my fellow citizens, the outcome is in your hands more than mine.    It is time to reach for the next dream.  It is time to look to the next horizon.  For America, the hope is there.  The sun is rising.  Our best days are still to come.    Goodnight, God bless you, and God bless America.    urlLink johnkerry.com
from the new republic, july 8 [as previously blogged]:  ... a third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis 'have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must.' What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement: 'The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington.' Says McCormack: 'I'm aware of no such comment.' But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that  'it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July' - the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.   what happens today?  'Security forces have captured a high-level al Qaeda operative in a raid in central Pakistan, Interior Minister Faisal Saleh Hayat said.'  judge for yourself.

&nbsp;EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:    LAW ENFORCEMENT:I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been 'lost' and is not available.   MILITARY:I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.   COLLEGE:I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money. With the help of my father and our right-wing friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America. I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money. I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history. With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the SupremeCourt, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with acriminal record.&nbsp; I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.   ECONOMY:I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history. I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period. I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market.In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend has continued for the majority of my time in office.   CABINET: I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My 'poorest millionaire,' Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President. I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.   PRIVILEGE: My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of mybest friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history, Enron. My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision. I have protected myfriends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.   CORRUPTION:I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. historyand refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.&nbsp; I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history. I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.   FOREIGN RELATIONS: I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government. I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.&nbsp; I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. 'prisoners of war' detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).   ACCESS:I set the record for fewest number of press conferences of any President since the advent of television. I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I resided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.   WORLD IMAGE: I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I have set the all-time record for most people worldwideto simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community. I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits foractive duty troops and their families -- in wartime.   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE: In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq, then blamed the lies on our British friends. I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security. I am supporting development of a nuclear 'Tactical Bunker Buster,' a WMD. I have so far failedto fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden to justice.   RECORDS AND REFERENCES:  All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my father's library, sealed and unavailable for public view. All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. All records or minutes from meetings that I, or my Vice-President, attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review.   PLEASE CONSIDER MY EXPERIENCE WHEN VOTING IN 2004.
John --  Given that if I die her options in life greatly diminish -- and given that others with similar conditions do not have access to the benefits that I can provide, albeit with difficulty -- I will opt for affordable.  That said, I don't consider the two goals (affordability and high quality) necessarily to be mutually exclusive -- but that, as with most things, is a matter of individual conclusions drawn from the available data.  And yes, I do indeed subscribe to a number of absolutes -- while accepting that acting on those absolutes is not entirely effective in all cases, despite the times when I do anyway.  They're also subject not only to change, but to wide variation based on past and future conditions.  I try to adapt and accept that any given conclusion I form may be wrong, but I don't often succeed.  The curse of consciousness:  the only universe I will ever truly know is the one I perceive, physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually.  If anything is a recipe for godhood, that's it.  Fraught with unseen dangers, human consciousness is.  That said, I wish there was a Republican I could vote for.  But conservative ideology has replaced judgment; guiding principles have become a careening, unthinking thrillride.  I'd say the same of a Democrat if such was the case; but so far, Kerry has not alarmed me.  Perhaps he will.  To be fair, very likely he will.  We left the altruistic politician (of any ideology) far behind some 200+ years ago (if he or she ever existed at all).  Until either party stops trying to stir its base into a frothy frenzy, the only option available to me is to do my part to keep the pendulum from swinging too far either way.  This administration has swung it too far, too fast.  Any party could have done it.  The pendulum's arc needs to be tempered.  Lacking a leader I can trust, I will opt for tempering until something better comes along.
i don't like the comments section - i think it makes it harder to keep up with threads because you have to look at each post and see if it has any comments attached to it.  me don't like.   and yes, i agree with ben about blade runner.  didn't notice it at first either john but it's very cool when you realize it.
Johnathan - On the healthcare issue, assuming that the two are mutually exclusive (and I certainly do not believe that are and hope they are not), which would you prefer to have - high quality or affordable healthcare?  As for absolutes, I think you (collective) have to have them to make decisions.  You either think something is right or wrong.  You believe something or you don't.  You think something is true or false.  I would bet that you (Johnathan) have more absolutes than realize, and that they help you form your outlook on life and opinion of things.  I think a strong leader has to see the world in absolutes, or else they are not strong.  Whether you agree with that leader is a reflection of your personal absolutes and how they compare with his (or hers).

I will vote for the candidate who will bring my country closer to providing affordable health care for my wife.  As a secondary value, I am unable to accept an individual, group, or nation striking first in any scenario.  On these I am currently unbendable, though I willingly acknowledge the danger of absolutes.  I am at peace with the paradox.
Luc -- People vote for the individual who will most likely represent what they value.  If it is impossible to imagine someone who might legitimately value a different thing than you, then most likely you perceive a universe of absolutes.  Thus, in a matter of speaking, you are a believer.  Which brings us back to your previous posting, which compared a believer to one who is drunk.  So perhaps you cannot fathom someone voting for Bush because you're drunk.
I will ask you the similar question.  Why would anyone vote  for  John Kerry?  I'm not asking why you hate George Bush, but why should I consider voting for Kerry?  I have not seen many people excited about voting for him.  I have seen plenty of people seething with hatred toward a man who has led us through a recession, terrorist attack, and massive corporate scandals, to the point that the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates to 'cool down the economy' (on a side note, I never have understood that reasoning).  I know plenty of people who hate him because he says what he believes and he does (or trys to do) what he says.  I asked Ben that question and got the very honest answer that he really wasn't voting for Kerry but against Bush.  I am probably in the same boat, on the opposite side.  I am a conservative.  I am for small government.  I believe that people are the answer to problems, not government.  I am probably more Libertarian than Republican, but until the Libertarians get off the 'legalize pot' argument as their primary campaign issue, I'll have to settle for the Republicans.  Don't misuderstand me, I think pot should be legalized and regualted, but they make a major PR gaff by making that their primary issue.  George Bush has disappointed me in many ways.  He has introduced some radically liberal, big government, social programs that I disagree with.  But, he has many more of my values than John Kerry.  In fact, I think that I only share one value with John Kerry - we both like living/breathing (as versus being dead).  Add to that the fact the he will not make a stand on an issue (i.e. waffling back and forth), then I have no respect for him at all.  I also like the hypocrisy of the talk of the 'Two Americas', considering his wealth and his running mates wealth.
Because...if you don't vote for Bush, you hate freedom.  Duh!

is it wrong to be insulted if your significant other calls you a pet name that they have called other people?  not the generic honey or sweetie type of thing - i.e.  i called my ex-boyfriend, 'snickerbuns' and then i start calling my current boyfriend 'snickerbuns' - and he finds out that this moniker has been used before - does he have a right to be offended and ask that i no longer call him that?

The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact than a drunken man is happier than a sober one. -George Bernard Shaw, writer, Nobel laureate (1856-1950)
concerning HVTs, or 'high value targets' such as Osama Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda operatives:   ...Pakistani security officials have been told they must produce HVTs (high-value targets) by the election. According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),  'The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections.'  Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations - according to a recently departed intelligence official, 'no timetable[s]' were discussed in 2002 or 2003 - but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt.   Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains,  'The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections.'  (These sources insisted on remaining anonymous. Under Pakistan's Official Secrets Act, an official leaking information to the press can be imprisoned for up to ten years.)   A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis  'have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must.'  What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement:  'The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington.'  Says McCormack: 'I'm aware of no such comment.' But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that  'it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July' - the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.    read the rest of the article  urlLink here .    concerning reports of Iraqi children being held in U.S. detention centers:   'According to information from the International Red Cross,  more than a 100 children are imprisoned in Iraq, including in the infamous prison Abu Ghraib.   The German TV magazine 'Report' revealed that there has been abuse of children and youth by the coalition forces.  Mainz - 'Between January and May of this year we've registered 107 children, during 19 visits in 6 different detention locations' the representative of the International Red Cross, Florian Westphal, told the TV station SWR's Magazine 'Report Mainz'. He noted that these were places of detention controlled by coalition troops. According to Westphal the number of children held captive could be even higher.'  read the rest of the article  urlLink here , and tom tomorrow's commentary and additional information  urlLink here .

'A Bush appointee to the newly created  urlLink 'Election Assistance Commission'  is concerned that there are no guidelines for canceling  or  rescheduling elections in the event of a terrorist attack.'   or?   i'd like to think that was a misprint.
Nick, I hope you're kidding when you ask if anyone was there...being that Joriel and Jason are in the bottom picture.  Silly head.
A friend forwarded me this.  Was anyone there?  Oh, and what's a 'freeper'?  I'm assuming 'helocopter' is just a typo - or a vehicle that greets everyone?
'who?' you may ask.  the vets on here know of whom i speak; allen went to high school with me, and later we worked on the entertainment staff at KD.  he's been a member of the Circle since the beginning, but hasn't posted in almost 2 years, and no one's seen him for the most part.  anyway, i ran into him yesterday afternoon at the state capitol, where a  urlLink protest  had been organized against a ban on same-sex unions.  allen is moving to williamsburg at the end of the summer, and planning on getting an MBA at william and mary.  so now you know.  and with this knowledge, you can take wing...

...to convince me that he's a clueless dunce.  His  urlLink response  when asked what he thought of the final report from the 9/11 commission:   'It reads like a mystery, a novel. It's well written,'  Bush told The Associated Press in a brief interview just outside his home in Crawford. Asked what he was gleaning from the report, he said, 'I'm gleaning that was a well-thought-out plot by the enemy.'  yeah, is suppose it did, george.  i'm sure it was chock full of twist and turns and surprises for you concerning the events that led up to the september attacks of 2001.  must have something to do with you being on vacation for over 40% of that time period, rather than GOING TO WORK AND DOING YOUR FUCKING JOB.  and i don't want to hear any whiny, tit-for-tat crap about how Clinton should have done a better job in regards to terrorism.  HE'S NOT PRESIDENT ANYMORE.  bush IS.  bush is responsible for what happened on his watch.  if he'd focused on terrorism and al-quaeda  at least  as much as his predecessor (or at all, for that matter), and the september attacks had happened anyway, maybe i would've cut him some slack.    but we'll never know, and i find his performance on this issue completely unsatisfactory.  anyone who doesn't (no matter what else we may disagree on regarding bush) is maintaining a interpretation of the facts that apparently my tiny brain can simply not manage.  or you're simply biased; whichever.

a serious  urlLink security bungle  on the part of the US; 'outing' a mole within al quaeda.  this person is a computer expert who was working with the Pakistani government, providing valuable intel for them concerning the members and movements of al quaeda.   this is the 'high visibility terrorist', an individual named Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan, whose capture in early july was not reported until the last day of the DNC; the information gained from him was part of the Bush admin's reasoning for last week's 'orange level' alert, but the timing was regrettable for several reasons...  from the article:  'Security experts contacted by Reuters said they were shocked by the revelations that the source whose information led to the alert was identified within days, and that U.S. officials had confirmed his name.   'The whole thing smacks of either incompetence or worse,' said Tim Ripley, a security expert who writes for Jane's Defense publications. 'You have to ask: what are they doing compromising a deep mole within al Qaeda, when it's so difficult to get these guys in there in the first place?   'It goes against all the rules of counter-espionage, counter-terrorism, running agents and so forth. It's not exactly cloak and dagger undercover work if it's on the front pages every time there's a development, is it?'  you can read the rest of the article  urlLink here .   oh, and the prime minister of Iraq has  urlLink shut down  Al-Jazeera in Baghdad.
an interesting  urlLink article  concerning the prohibition of vehicles weighing over 6000 pounds on certain streets of cities in California (for which every SUV qualifies).    makes me wonder if cities in other states have such laws on the books; richard, any thoughts?  this might be an interesting assignment.  i feel like i've seen similar signs in Richmond, but i couldn't swear to it...

Democrats have all but ceded the Amish vote to Republicans.  'If I know Republicans and their grass-roots operations, they'll spend most of their time trying to phone bank the Amish,' said Kerry spokesman Mark Nevins.

'It has been months since the now-infamous  urlLink photographs  from Abu Ghraib revealed that American soldiers tortured Iraqi prisoners - yet the Bush administration has failed to get to the bottom of the abuses. 'There are some serious unanswered questions,' says Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican on the Armed Services Committee. The Pentagon is stalling on several investigations, and congressional inquiries have ground to a halt. The foot-dragging is astonishing, given that Congress has access to classified documents detailing the abuses outlined by Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba in his report on Abu Ghraib. Rolling Stone obtained those files in June and offers this report on their contents.  The new classified military documents offer a chilling picture of what happened at Abu Ghraib - including detailed reports that U.S. troops and translators sodomized and raped Iraqi prisoners. The secret files - 106 'annexes' that the Defense Department withheld from the Taguba report last spring - include nearly 6,000 pages of internal Army memos and e-mails, reports on prison riots and escapes, and sworn statements by soldiers, officers, private contractors and detainees. The files depict a prison in complete chaos. Prisoners were fed bug-infested food and forced to live in squalid conditions; detainees and U.S. soldiers alike were killed and wounded in nightly mortar attacks; and loyalists of Saddam Hussein served as guards in the facility, apparently smuggling weapons to prisoners inside.'   read the rest of the article  urlLink here .  i'd warn you in advance about the graphic content, but it should hardly surprise anyone at this point.

same feed from before, but this one was much easier to confirm; it's a far cry from her  urlLink point of view  just four years ago...    urlLink  Nancy Reagan to Bush: 'We Don't Support Your Re-Election'    The widow of former President, and Republican icon, Ronald Reagan has told the GOP she wants nothing to do with their upcoming national convention or the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush.   Nancy Reagan turned down numerous invitations to appear at the Republican National Convention and has warned the Bush campaign she will not tolerate any use of her or her late husbands words or images in the Presidents re-election effort.  Mrs. Reagan does not support President Bushs re-election and neither to most members of the Presidents family, says a spokesman for the former First Lady...  ...The Reagans split with Bush and the party centers around stem cell research which many believe can help find a cure for Alzheimers, the disease that crippled President Reagan in his final years. Bush and the ultra-conservative wing of the Republican Party oppose use of new stem cells. The Reagans, with the exception of Michael [Reagan], support such use.  Theres more to the feud than that, however. Nancy Reagan has told close followers she believes Bush and the current Republican leadership have divided America with their extreme views. She has told Republican leaders she wants nothing to do with the party or Bush.  During the week of Reagans funeral, the former First Lady went ballistic when she learned the Bush campaign was test marketing new ads that used Reagans photos and speeches in an effort to show he supported Bush and his re-election. She personally called Republican Party Chief Ed Gillespie to demand the ads be destroyed.   read the rest of this article  urlLink here ; the 'missing' bit from what i posted here concerns the adopted Reagan son Michael, who does indeed support Bush.

Bush is withdrawing more and more from aides and senior staff, retreating into a private, paranoid world where only the ardent loyalists are welcome.  Cabinet officials, senior White House aides and leaders on Capitol Hill complain privately about the increasing lack of 'face time' with the President and campaign advisors are worried the depressed President may not be up to the rigors of a tough re-election campaign.  'Yes, there are concerns,' a top Republican political advisor admitted privately Wednesday. 'The George W. Bush we see today is not the same, gregarious, back-slapping President of old. He's moody, distrustful and withdrawn.'  Bush's erratic behavior and sharp mood swings led White House physician Col. Richard J. Tubb to put the President on powerful anti-depressant drugs after he stormed off stage rather than answer reporters' questions about his relationship with indicted Enron executive Kenneth J. Lay, but White House insiders say the strong, prescription medications seem to increase Bush's sullen behavior towards those around him.  'This is a President known for his ability to charm people one-on-one,' says a staff member to House Speaker Dennis J. Hastert. 'Not any more.'   read the rest of this frightening article  urlLink here .
You know, the music teacher at my kid's elementary school is a dear, dear woman, but I question her thinking sometimes.  Yesterday afternoon I spent almost an hour with my wife, two youngest boys, my daughter, my mother-in-law, and probably 100 other kids and family members watching a school music program in a church parking lot, in 90 degree weather, cooking like a steak on the asphalt of the parking lot.  Now, this morning, I'm being aggravated by the sunburn I aquired.  To top it off, I cooked out last night for my father-in-law's birthday and didn't have a chance to shower last night or this morning(okay, I could have showered this morning if I'd pulled my lazy butt out of bed early enough), so I smell like a bar-b-que.  Oh well, I guess it could be worse, I could just stink.
Here are the contest particulars... Beginning Monday morning, 5/24, there will be a voucher hidden somewhere in the Clovis area that you need to find and bring to the KKYC studios at 10th and Sycamore to redeem for the pair of Shania Twain tickets.  Beginning Monday morning we'll begin giving clues to the location of the voucher.  At the end of each day I will post the day's clue here.  The person who finds the voucher and brings it to the studio will win a pair of 15th row tickets to Shania Twain June 26th in Lubbock.  Good hunting!!
Yes, today is the day advocated in an e-mail making the rounds to boycott and don't buy any gas.  My thought is that only hurts the little guy here in Clovis who owns the stores(okay, maybe not Allsups).  My thought is if you DO plan to not buy gas today as a protest, still stop in the local convenience stores and buy a drink or a bag of chips or something.  Don't punish a store owner that is just as much at the mercy of the supplier as we are, maybe even more so.  What do you think?
Hey, got acouple pair of tix to the Merle/Wille show in Roswell July 3rd.  Giving them away this morning.
Been a long day, gonna pack it in and head to Casa Daniels.  Maybe I can get more than 4 hours of sleep tonight.  Just found out that there are Van Halen tix still available for the Lubbock show in September, and they're cheaper than I was told they would be.  Maybe I can still get the wife to go, but she said she'd go if I went with her to see Jessica Simpson in Lubbock in July.  Is the trade worth it?  I think so, may be the final chance to see the VH boys.

Well, overslept this AM, but got the day back on track.  Typing is tough this morning because I'm injured.  Took a line-drive off the pinky finger playing softball last night and now I'm whining about it.  I'm a whiner, what can I say?  WAAAAA!  I'm posting this here first, before it makes it on the air...Listen starting Thursday morning at 7:20 and I'll start giving the details on our contest for the Shania Twain concert tickets.  And don't be surprised if I post those details here BEFORE then.
I want to welcome everyone to my blog.  Who am I?  Well, since you are here you probably know who I am, but just in case you blundered in by accident, here goes.  I'm Joe Daniels, and I am the Operations Manager for KKYC-FM and KICA-AM & FM in Clovis, New Mexico.  I'm also the morning dude on KKYC and the afternoon dude on KICA-FM.  I have an incredibly tolerant wife and 4 beautiful children that are my entire life.  I also have an Associates Degree in Web Technologies from Clovis Community College, as well as a General Studies Associates from CCC.  And I am seriouly considering going to law school in the future.  Or becoming a greeter at Wal-Mart, I haven't quite decided.
Here is the clue for Friday in the 'Search For Shania':  'Off the beaten path'  So, all the clues together now:  1)North of the BNSF 2)Rest a minute 3)Smell the flowers 4)Flashing lights 5)Off the beaten path  If you have been looking for the voucher, leave me a comment and let me know where you have looked.  I'm curious to know what ideas you're getting from these clues, and how cold of hot you all are.  Also, we will not give new clues over the weekend.  We'll start giving more new clues on Monday.  Bet someone finds it this week.
You know, I'm not a fan of the Buffaloes or their head football coach Gary Barnett.  He's a putz on a good day.  At best he's an insensitive jerk, and at worst he knows about and has condoned rape.  He should have been fired for the insensitive comments he made about the rape accusations made by 9 women, and the rape allegations levelled by Katie Hnida, who tried to be a kicker for the Buffaloes, and eventually transfered to UNM and became the first woman to score in a men's Division I football game.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, when told about alegations by Hnida made in a Sports Illustrated article that she had been raped by a teammate while at Colorado, Barnett said, 'Well, she wasn't much of a player anyway'.  Colorado got a blackeye in all this, and then yesterday poked their eye out by reinstating Barnett.  Barnett stayed because he usually wins.  Who wants to bet if the team goes 3-8 or 2-9 this season, Barnett is looking for a new job?  And even sadder, who wants to bet he's not looking long?
No winner yet...the 'Search For Shania' continues...Adding clue #4 to the list...  1)North of the BNSF 2)Rest a minute 3)Smell the flowers 4)Flashing lights  Clue 5 is on the way Friday morning between 6 and 10...
Sorry I'm a little late with this post.  Dealing with a sick child last night.  Think the antibiotic is starting to work, though.  He has strep throat, by the way.  Anyhoo, here is clue #3 in the 'Search For Shania':  'Smell the flowers'  So, thus far we have:  1)  North of the BNSF 2)  Rest a minute 3)  Smell the flowers  Clue #4 is on the way this morning between 6 and 10.  Stay tuned, same bat time, smae bat channel....
Why do we pronounce Wednesday with a silent 'd'?  Anyway, apologies for being late this morning.  Was getting ready about 5:35 when the wife called out to me and said Zachary, our almost 2 yeaqr old, was burning up.  He's had to fever induced seizures since last October, and the one in March left him in the hospital for a week, so as you might imagine, the thought of any fever at all kinda freaks us out.  So, I stayed until I was pretty sure he was ok.  We think he was just real hot because he slept all night wrapped up in his favorite goosedown blanket.  Probably not the blanket he needs to use during the hotter part of the year huh?  Search For Shania clue #3 on the way before 10.
Here is Tuesday's clue in the 'Search For Shania' on KKYC.  Today's clue is 'Rest a minute'.  So, the two clues are:   1)  North of the BNSF 2)  Rest a minute  Listen for the third clue tomorrow morning on my show sometime between 6 and 10, if I get up  and get to work on time.
After a few weeks of drooling non-stop and gnawing on everythung in sight, our 5 month old has finally broken through that first tooth.  Front, bottom right.  Too cool.  The first clue in the Search For Shania is 'North of the BNSF'.  Listen for clue #2 tomorrow morning on my show.
Oldhippie1, the smell was actually pork chops and hot dogs, but fortunately I got to shower over the weekend.  Speaking of which, weekend was good and busy.  Hosted our annual 'School's Out' party for our kids.  Normally we plan for 40 or 50 and have 2 show up, but this year we invited our church too, and since we're Baptists and there was food, and Baptists really like to eat, we had a full back yard.  Then I spent all of yesterday afternoon trying to set up a swimming pool that is supposed to be ready for water in 30 minutes.  2 Hours later when I started filling it with water, I realized 10 year olds think 'ready for water in 30 minutes' actually means 'ready to swim in in 30 minutes'.  They forget the part about 'takes 8 hours to fill up with water so you can swim'.  I'm just glad my 8 year old was over at her grandparents so I only had to hear it from one impatient child.  'Search For Shania' is officially underway!  Glad I was able to hide the voucher at midnight last night without getting arrested.  Listen through the day today for the first clue.  I'll post the clue each day here on the blog, so you'll be able to get it in cased you miss it oon the air.  I'll actually post it and add it to the list of clues, so each successive post will have every clue so you can see them all together.  Might help you out seeing them all together.  Ain't I nice?
Not long ago I was sitting at a stop light here in town, and a Cadillac Escalade pulled up next to me.  Now, I was sitting in my Ford Expedition, which I consider a pretty kick ass vehicle, even though it's a 97 model, so it's a few years old.  But still, Expeditions are pretty dang nice.  But an Escalade is an Escalade, right?  Anyway, I noticed the back wsindow of the Escalade was dirty, and had some doodlings in the dirt, but even more, some bird had decided to make this Escalade it's personal outhouse.  And it occured to me, no matter your social status, no matter how classy a vehicle you drive, bird's don't care, they will still crap all over it.  Kinda sums up life, if you ask me.  Also have a cocroach in the hallway ooutside the studio door this morning, obviously not feeling too well.  Don't know if heate too much crap or what, but he's on his back and not kicking too much.  I haven't stepped on him yet, though, as much as I'd like too.  No, it's not pity...it's not wanting cockroach guts on the bottom of my shoe.
Can you believe it?  If someone had told me we'd hit the 100 degree mark for the first time June 2nd, I would have said, right, sure we will.  But it happened.  At 4 yesterday afternoon, it was 100 at Cannon Air Force Base.  100 degrees!  And it's still 3 weeks til Summer officially begins.  So, hot enough for ya?
You ever get up and almost immediately you know it's going to be one of those days?  Welp, today is one of those days.  Hopefully I have things back together and things will return to a semblance of normalcy.  Thanks COurtney for the posts.  The path ih that last clue was kind of a double clue, although it was meant more to mean the walking path.  However, one of the clues for this week was going to be 'Follow the pathway', referring to CCC's old slogan 'Pathway to your future'(which, as an aside, when I first got to Clovis almost 10 years ago and heard for the first time, I thought said 'halfway to your future'...I know, I'm not always too sharp).  Congratulations on winning the tickets, and sorry I didn't get to meet you and your husband in person.  Thanks for listening and playing!
Exercise your democratic right and get out and vote!  OK, just because someone found the Shania voucher doesn't mean the blog is closing down.  Oh no!  The blog will continue forward.  It existed before the search, and it will continue long afterward.  And speaking of the search, where was the voucher?  I know you're all dying to know.  Well, it was at Clovis Community College, at the track, taped to the underside of a cement bench at the west end of the track.  I still haven't at this point had the winner come in and claim the tickets, but the business office is justg now opening, so I expect her to arrive any minute.  I'm dying to know which of the 5 very vague(I thought...shows what I know) clues gave it away for her and her husband.  I'll let you know....
I can't beleived someone found the voucher already!  I am amazed that someone could find it from those clues.  I would never have thought to look where it was hidden from the 5 clues from last week.  Where was the voucher hidden, you ask?  Well, I'll finally reveal that Tuesday morning on the air after the winner comes by the studio to claim the tickets.   Hope everyone has a safe and happy Memorial Day.  Remember today why we have Memorial Day every year.  Go lay flowers on the grave of a veteran you don't know, and of course on the ones you do.  And say a prayer for all the men and women fighting right now in Iraq and Afghanistan.  And remember, if you're celebrating with a few libations, don't drink and drive.
First of all, let me say I am not immune to the pain the family of the woman tragically killed last July 4th in a police pursuit here in Clovis.  That being said, I am curious.  I see in an article in our local 'newspaper' that her family has filed a lawsuit against the city, and the former Clovis police officer involved, for being negligent.  The point I question is not whether they were or were not, because I have no idea.  What I do wonder is why the person who is responsible for the pursuit, the person who crashed into and killed the woman, the person who, if he had not run from the police, would not have caused the death of the woman, why is the family not suing him as well?  Is it because he has no money should they prevail in their lawsuit?  How can he bare no responisibility?  Had he pulled over as he should have when the police officer attempted to stop him, none of this would have happened.  So why is it solely the responsibilty of the city and the former officer?  Again, why is the person who ran not named as well in this lawsuit?  Maybe it's because he doesn't have $750,000, or insurance that is kept for just such an instance as this that will probably eventually settle?  Makes one wonder...
You know, I have been here at the radio station for almost 10 years now, and for that entire time the trash can in the kitchen area has been in the same place.  Yesterday, for some unknown reason, they moved it.  Now, I realize this is a small thing, but why did they have to move it?  What was wrong with the space where it has been since I got here?  Was it something mandated by OSHA?  Had it become a hazard where it was?  Or did someone just feel the overwhelming urge to screw with stuff?  Or is this part of the ongoing great conspiracy here to drive Joe crazy?  If that's the case, I ain't got far to go.  Man, glad I don't own an automatic weapon.
The Tampa Bay Lightning are the Stanley Cup Champions!  My new favorite team took the cup with a 2-1 win over the Calgary(Alberta, Canada...Lance Storm, anyone?) Flames last night.  Now I really don't have anything personal against the Flames, but the Lightning have been a laughing stock in the NHL for so long I just had to root for them.  Plus, as long as a Canadian team doesn't win the cup, I'm happy.  Hey, it's a friendly rivalry wit da Great White Nort, but it is s a rivalry.  I don't know how many, if any, people are actually checking out this blog, but if you are, let me know, ok?  Take a couple minutes to register with blogger.com so you can post comments.  Any comments.  I just am looking for some feedback, whether it's about the blog, my posts, the radio station(either one, KKYC or KICA), or just life in general.  This is a good place to get hold of me if I'm not on the air, obviously.  Want me to play a request tomorrow morning?  Make a comment on here, and more than likely I'll see it in time to get it on for you the next day.  Heck, I might even see it in time to get to it today.  Give it a shot.  What, you actually have better things to do while you're sitting at work, surfing the net?
by the weekend passing of the greatest president in our country's recent history.  President Ronald Reagan was a great American, and I am sad to hear of his death.  It seems hard to believe that it had been 10 years since he announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer's.  He had been so much out of the public eye that it was easy to forget that, I guess.  I can only think of one thing that I wish Ronnie hadn't done, and that is the deregulation of the broadcast industry.  That has resulted in all the bland, cookie cutter, sucky radio you hear across the country.  Kinda scared me that Ronnie thought a nuclear war was winnable, but you know what?  If Ronnie had been president, Afghanistan would have been nuked, and I'm not sure that would have been a bad thing...
Well, on one hand I am glad to see the Supreme Court tell this putz Michael Newdow to go home, but on the other I am disappointed they didn't make a stand and tell him to permanently go away, that 'One nation, under God'  does not violate the seperation of church and state.  I mean, George Washington himself said the blue in our flag represented Heaven.  And where does it say that a person that is an athiest HAS to say that part anyway?  I could come closer to understanding their argument if they were required by law to say it, but they are not.  They're not even required to say the pledge.  But instead, the Supreme Court said he couldn't sue to have that phrase removed on behalf of his daughter because he doesn't have custody of her.  While that is true, why did they take the easy way out and leave the door open for him or some other moron to bring it up again?  One of these days they'll have to rule on it on the basis of seperation of church and state, and I guess all we can do is hope they make the right ruling....

If you have logged on here recently looking for some pearls of wisdom, or something remotely enlightening or even mildly humorous, my apologies.  I just have not been feeling the mojo of late.  Been out of sorts for some reason.  I think I'm getting too much sleep.  I know, sounds odd, but I am at the point, after almost 10 years of being here and on the air by 6 am almost everyday, that I seem to function better on about 4 hours of sleep.  And I love to sleep, so that really sucks.  But, see, just now I had a thought that seemed worth putting down on the screen, but it slipped away.  And I can't get it back.  ARGH!  Plus, I can't get rid of this damn phlemg!
It never ceases to amaze me how unproductive I can be when I set my mind to it.  I've worked a lot this week, but I still feel like I haven't accomplished a thing.  And now it's the weekend, where you aren't supposed to accomplish anything.  I should be going to visit my parents and brothers in Borger, but don't feel like I can get away this weekend.  Plus, our two youngest aren't feeling well.  Hopefully they are feeling better this morning.  Haven't heard from the better half yet this morning, which should be a good sign.  Hope it means they haven't gotten up and woke her up yet.  So, do 2 year olds normally puzzle out things?  I'm referring to our 2 year old, Mr. Furious, who yesterday for 2 hours tried everything he could think of to circumvent my rule that he not get in our swimming pool as he is too short to not drown without help.  He drug every chair, toys, rock, you name it, to the edge of the above ground pool and tried to climb in.  I'd get rid of one thing, he'd look around until he found something else.  And you could just see the wheels spinning in his little pointed head.  It amazes me.  Plus, I think he's a mutant.  I've never seen a 2 year old that could pick up a 32 inch TV, but if he could get his arms around it, the little turd would lift it up.  The only thing keeping him from doing it is that one fact, his arms are just too short to get around the TV enough for leverage.  He can lift either end with no problem.  Amazing.
http://www.herald-sun.com/votebook/citizenship/citstart.html  Here is the URL for the test.  It's fun to see how you would fair.  After the one test I took where I got the question about the mayor of Durham, I took it a few more times and eventually got a question about who is the Governor of North Carolina..I didn't chbeck, but my guess is the Herald-Sun is in NC, and probably in Durham...Duh, huh?
So the terrorists in Saudi Arabia have beheaded another American.  How do we handle this?  How do we stop this?  For years, I have said the way to stop planes being hijacked was the next time some group of terrorists hijacked a plane, we blow it up.  Yes, that would also kill all the passengers on board, but do you think any more hijackers would be lining up any time soon to hijack a plane?  Not all the terrorists are in such a hurry to go see allah as the ones on 9/11.  So, back to the question of how to handle the current crisis of Americans being kidnapped, and then beheaded when demands aren't met to release captive al-Quida members.  First of all, don't suggest, REQUIRE that all Americans in Saudi leave the country.  Secondly, what we should do THIS MINUTE is take every captive that the terrorists were demaning be released before they beheaded Paul Johnson and behead them.  They are making the rules, maybe it's time we started to play by them.
So the price for the life of a 2 week old girl is now 14 years, eh?  If you haven't heard, the individual that crashed his semi into he back of a car near Elida last August, killing the 2 week old daughter of the couple inside, was sentenced to 14 years in prison.  He admitted having been drinking and fled the scene of the accident on foot.  HE KILLED A 2 WEEK OLD GIRL AND HE ONLY GOT 14 YEARS IN PRISON!  No wonder our justice system has become such a joke...
Went last night to the midnight premiere of Spider-Man 2.  I have been looking forward to the release ever since I heard the date.  My wife actually accused me of being more excited about the release of the movie than I was about getting married.  Not true, but I was excited and looking forward to it.  Then, as it got closer to midnight, I started to get apprehensive about going to see it.  What if I don't like it?  What if it doesn't live up to the hype?  Sequels are NEVER as good as the first movie.  Well, in this case, it is.  It was worth not getting to bed until nearly 3 and having to be at work at 6.  Doctor Octopus was very cool.  It didn't seem to me that there was as much fight action between Spider-Man and Doc Ock as there was with the Green Goblin in the first one, and I'm not sure if that was an effort to focus more on Peter Parker, or because the Doc Ock special FX were more expensive.  It was cool none the less.  So, who is the villian going to be in the thrid installment, which they have already announced will be made?  Will it be Harry as the new Green Goblin?  Maybe he'll be Hobgoblin.  Or, could it be The Lizard, since they introduced Dr. Connors in this one?  Or perhaps Man-Wolf, John Jameson, the son of J. Jonah Jameson, who stole the show again in his scenes, which thankfully there were more of this time.  Guess we'll have to wait 2 years to find out, as I hear it is a VERY closely guarded secret.  HMMM, maybe they'll use Venom...  On another note, who's running the property formally known as Lucky Dog here?  Is it the city?  I ask because as I was driving in to work this morning at 6, after the good rain we got last night, the sprinklers were on full blast all over the property.  So much for the Stage 1 water restrictions the city and the water company want us to adhere to...
Something bothers me about the 14 year old that killed his father, stepmother, and stepsister on Sam Donaldson's ranch near Hondo.  Something other than the fact he killed someone, other than the fact he killed his father.  It bothers me that a 14 year old, abused or not, thinks that is an acceptable way to handle the situation.  Our culture of violence has taught kids it's okay to handle a situation like that in this manner.  And it also bothers me that everyone seems to know the boy was being abused, and either didn't or couldn't do anything about it.  And now they all seem to be of the opinion that it is ok he killed his own father, as well as his stepmother and stepsister, because he was abused.  Does that make it ok to kill your own father?  To kill anyone?  I don't know, but it bothers me that we seem to think automatically that it does.
Haven't posted anything in a week, and it's because not much has happened, I guess.  But since I have this blog, I feel the overwhelming need to post SOMETHING, no matter how boring.  Actually, last Friday was pretty exciting.  We had a great day on our rock station selling gas for an hour for only 98 cents.  It was a madhouse, which is exactly what we wanted.  Got a lot of attention, although we didn't get the newspaper coverage we had hoped for.  Oh well, can't have everything.
Someone please explain to me how someone can become so far gone as to set their 3 children on fire, along with their mother and themselves?  If you didn't hear, a guy in Seattle poured gas on himself and his ex-girlfriend and their 3 children, ages 6 months, 1 1/2 and 2 1/2, as they were driving down the road.  The car then crashed and he jumped out, on fire, and started firing guns.  He and the kids died at the scene, the woman lived for 8 hours and was able to tell authorites what happened.  She had recently filed assault charges against the man.  I have 4 children, ages 10, 8, 2, and 6 months.   I can't even fathom a situation where I would intentionally do something like that to them.  They are the most important things in my life.  Anyone who tried to harm them I would kill with no hesitation and no remorse.  How could I possibly injure or kill them?  I could never be that far gone.  Or evil.  I realize the Bible says all sin is the same in God's eyes, and hell is as hot for one soul as another, but being human, I can't help but hope their is a little hotter corner of hell for this person, and people like him.  And I pray the children were asleep and never knew what happened, just woke up in Heaven.
I'm not even sure where to begin, because nothing of really extreme significance has occured, yet a lot of significant things have happened.  Had my 2 year old's birthday party finally last night, almost a month after his birthday.  We had a party for him on his birthday up at the lake, but this was the big cookout bash birthday party that all the friends and more family got to come to.  It was hot dogs for about 25 people.  And a huge Spider-Man birthday cake.  My wife was leary of getting such a big cake, and then was very glad she talked herself into it.  Had a Spider-Man pinada too, one that was the head and shoulders of Spidey.  The kids didn't so much break it open as they decapitated poor ol' Spidey, and when that happened my son went into hysterics.  Didn't handle seeing his hero decapitated too well.  But after he realized Spider-Man was full of candy, he was better about it.  We also found out that he's now tall enough to stand in our swimming pool and not be below water.  I don't know if that is good or bad.  I say that because on one hand it's good...if he manages to get outside and into the pool by himself(which he is very capable of doing), then he shouldn't drown...the bad thing is it takes away his fear of the pool, which has been the only thing keeping him from climbing into the pool by himself.  If he does that, even though he can stand up and have his head well out of the water, if he slips  and goes under, he might panic only being 2 and not realize all he has to do is stand up.  Sometimes, fear is a good thing.  He has none what so ever.  My 2 year old has a lot of 'Hey, y'all, watch this' in his future, I am afraid.
First, starting Monday morning I will begin doing a tried and true radio thang,  called 'Pick It or Flick It'.  You know what I'm talking about, I'm sure.  At 8 every morning I will play a new song that we have not added to our normal song rotation, and give listeners a chance to call in or post a comment on here as to their opinion, should we pick it or flick it,  meaning should we keep playing it or toss it.  Hope you'll participate.    Second, I have noticed a song that has been a pretty big pop and rock hit, the Los Lonely Boys' 'Heaven', is at #18 on the CMT Top 20 Countdown.  And now I have started getting requests for it.  Have you heard the song, and do you think we should play it?  Post a comment on here, or call me at 762-8200.
I am so proud of myself...for the second day in a row, my show this morning was completely live!  Now, you say to yourself, 'Self, what does he mean?  I listen to him and he sounds alive, usually.  Occassionally he sounds a bit comatose, but not dead.  So what does he mean by live?'  Well, here comes the dirty little secret part... we have a computer that allows us to record ourselves and plug it into the music, hopefully making it sound like we are here when we are actually not.  We could be on the other side of the globe, for that matter.  Better than almost every other station in the market, though.  Except for one other station in Clovis and Portales, other than our 2 stations(KKYC-FM and KICA-FM), all the stations here are on satellite from either Dallas or Denver AT LEAST 21 hours a day.  Some are on a satellite fed service 24 hours a day.  So we are the exception, and are truly your local hometown stations.  That being typed, however, let me continue to let the cat out of the proverbial bag.  What you hear on our 2 stations after 9 am is usually recorded.  Example, I usually start recording what you hear me say beginning about 8:30 that morning.  Hopefully, you think it sounds like I am really there.  My shift from 4 to 7 every Monday through Friday on KICA-FM(98.3, rock, should you care to tune in) is 99.9% recorded.  I usually 'track it out', as we say in the biz, around 3:30.  But the last 2 mornings, I have felt compelled to do my entire shift from 6 to 10 on KKYC-FM(102.3, country, should you care to tune in) live, without recording a thing.  Almost like the old days of radio, except I didn't have to actually change records or CD's, the computer still played all the music.  But you know what, it was a blast to do the whole thing live.  I think I might start doing it everyday, as long as I don't have something I have to go take care of that necessitates me having to leave the studio or building for an extended period.  God, I miss live radio....
Well, I certainly hope you guys missed me, otherwise, why the hell did I come back from vacation?  Went to Conchas Lake and did some fishing for a few days, and caught a whopping 2 perch that could have been twins.  Make that triplets, because my oldest son and my nephew caught the third one right on the surface with our net.  My 2 year old caught his first fish(with some help from dad and his cousin), a baby catfish that, even though it was a baby, outweighed both my perch put together.  And I did have a pretty good sized bass that I at least got to the surface before he spit the hook out, and he went one way and the hook and worm went the other way.  Oh well, had fun and family time, and that is really what it was all about.  And not catching any fish meant I didn't have to clean any fish, which is always a good thing.  Anyway, and this is totally unsolicited, if you ever go to Conchas, I highly recommend you stay at Adobe Lodge.  It used to be housing for the Corps of Engineers when they were building the dam, and now someone has bought it and turned the duplexes into lodges.  Very, very nice.  Very close to the North marina and a great view of the lake.  Check them out.  Two thumbs WAY up!

Once again, your old friend Joe Daniels displays his amazing cognitive abilities...All along I have been saying I don't think Kobe Bryant is guilty of rape.  Stupidity, yes.  Felony stupidity.  But rape?  Don't think so.  Why?  First of all, he's KOBE BRYANT!  He has women lined up around the street to do anything he wants anytime he wants anyhow he wants.  He doesn't have to rape someone.  Secondly, everything about this from day one has smacked of the 'victim' filing a civil lawsuit eventually.  Well, guess what, my friends...it came out today that the 'victim' is going to talk to the prosecutor in the case about dropping the charges because she is afraid details about her sex life might keep the trial from being fair.  In other words, it might prejudice the jury AGAINST HER .  And wouldn't that screw up her civil lawsuit which, oh by the way, she said she might file now.  Now before I get strung up for being insensitive, let me say that a woman's sexual history doesn't mean she can't be a victim of rape.  A woman can be raped whether she is a nun or a hooker, and it is no less horrible a crime because of her history.  However, for a woman to allege rape when none occurred is equally apalling.  No matter what the outcome of all this, whether the charges are now dropped, whether it goes to trial and Kobe is acquitted, or it goes to trial and he is convicted, Kobe Bryant will never be the same.  Now, could I be wrong about his guilt?  Of course, but I don't think I am... but if I am, I hope his celebrity does not get him off and I hope he does the max.

I went on the net after and talked 2 friends.
I'm so sad right now.  It's sad that I feel the way I do.  I shouldn't be this upset over a person.  Letting this feeling ruin my mood and my evening.  But it's happening.  I don't know if this is real or my mind and my heart are distorting my actual feelings to make it seem like I should be feeling this bad or that I actual love him this much.  I just wish he would just take me back so we can be happy.  I know I can make him happy.  If only he knew.  I feel like such a loser, it doesn't even make sense.  Someone should get a gun and put me out of my misery because I am making a fucking mockery out of my self not to mention embarrassing my self.  God.  Love Sucks!  It just grabs a hold of you and jerks you all around and then throws you on the ground and leaves you there all bruised and bloody.  Not to mention hurting and confused.  But its so wonderful while it lasts right!?  Sure whatever. Yakima
I am so in love.  It is ridiculous.  I'm sure that he loves me too, but I don't know if he loves me with the intensity that I love him.  Shit I'm thinking of him throughout the day.  Talking about him constantly.  It seems to come from out of no where.  Natay this, Natay that.  I know people get tired of it.  I do too.  It only makes my fall harder and stay deeper in the feelings I cannot seem to control.  I just want to be with him forever.  It sucks, because when it doesn't happen I am going to be sooooo hurt.  Man, I can almost feel it just thinking about it.  Why can't I just have him.  I don't know if I can't, but I don't know if I can either.  This not knowing sure sucks.  I don't like it.  What did he do to make me fall for him so.  He is just wonderful.  He's beautiful.  He has a beautiful person.  He's so true and so honest.  How many guys out there are this good.  There probably are  a lot, but how much rubbish do you have to crawl through to find them.  Too much.  I just want to keep him.  It makes me feel so dreamy and so longing and the same time thinking about it.  I think I'd be so happy if I could be with him forever.  We have so much fun together.  Laughing, talking playing, smiling.  We just genuinely have a great time in each other's company.  Love, it is something funny isn't it.  The emotions it takes you through.  But it can feel so good.  Just being in love.  Man I want to see him right now.  I can wait until I see him this weekend.  I'm like a kid getting ready to go to Disney land for the first time.  May the lord bless me with sweet dreams tonight.
God I miss my ex so much.  We broke up about a month ago.  He broke up with me.  He says he has a lot on his mind and he doesn't know what direction his life is taking and he doesn't want to hold me back.  Hold me back from what?  From who?  He's who I want to be with.  Does he really mean he doesn't want to hold himself back?  He says that he's not even sure he wants to settle down for good.  He doesn't know if I'm the last girl he wants to date.  Oh.  Okay.  Now I'm sitting here missing him.  The wierd thing is at first it didn't even seem like we had broken up because we still did all the same things.  But now that I've moved out, we're not together all the time anymore.  So now the reality of it is setting in.  We're not together.  I love him so much.  All I can do is shake my head, sigh and hope for the best.
Last weekend was a memorable one for me!  I have been to the street at George V near Arc De Triomphe to buy a camera looking for a SONY showroom. Itâs verisimilar to the Brigade Road in Bangalore but its very long and very wide with wide platforms.  When I reached here I was thinking that people here are too cold like the weather here. But the walk down that street made me re-think! People are screaming! But maybe thatâs not real happiness, but at least you get a feel of how it would look like!  On both the sides of the street there are big automobile showrooms of every international carmakers!  Wherever you go you see the orderliness of the buildings and the meticulous plan of the city that makes transport so easy and trouble-free unlike our Indian roadways and railways which are quite confusing! You just have a map of Paris with the routes of RERs, Metros and SNCFs (various types of trains) and voila! you can go anywhere without troubling anybody. Cool!  Then at last in a showroom in La Defense I saw a camera that was good and I bought it.  The next day Iâve been to 'Musee de Louvre' and 'Tour Eiffel'.  Just to behold the building of the museum, which they say was used by Napoleon Bonaparte, is wonderful. Itâs too huge.  The museum is divided into 4 main buildings with 2 stages. After spending some 6 hours inside, I could cover only half of it!  The sculptures and the paintings have a lasting influence, which makes them eternal. The Greek and Italian sculptures of the well-built kings and soldiers made me feel very puny! There is one feeling that runs and that connects all these pieces in the museum together. BEAUTY. Exquisite, exemplary beauty in all its splendours. No inhibitions whatsoever. The artists just seem to express themselves.  The sculptures and paintings make you think that artists love nudity for its revealing beauty of the human body. Felt proud of having one of those myself! Common people seem to abuse this!  When I saw those paintings, I really wondered how the society would have tortured those artists, those amazing gods of eternality, for they might not have been 'productive' by its standards! Surely many of them would have died of starvation for the world accepts a genius only after it slays him! Felt really strange! Every one of those paintings and sculptures tell you a story , even though the explanation given by the placards placed in front of them speaks French! I understand and cry as a salute to those gods!  There was a rush to see the Monalisa painting .For once, you feel that all ways in the museum lead to that painting! But when I saw that, I couldnât quite understand whatâs so great about it, thanks to my appalling ignorance of art! That too the lady looks as if she has not slept properly posing for the picture! In spite of my ignorance, I saw many other paintings that captured my attention and ate my memory card of the camera!  Next I've been to the Eiffel tower, just to have a look at it. Thought that it would not be so interesting and would be dull to behold. But as usual I was proved grossly wrong! What a massive structure and what imagination! Indeed people who love beauty seem not to think of logic, reasoning and purpose. But I think that even though it looks like that prima facie, its not so. Beauty is in itself a purpose! Create things which are beautiful and you have given them a meaning for them to exist!  When I get closer and closer to the tower, I slowly realized the size. I felt really fearful when I was at its foot. Beauty and mass mixes up to produce fear?! Quite strange! For every 10 minutes of an hour they switch on the lights, which randomly sparkle all over the tower and which simply cannot be captured by a still camera! Nor do I think that any kind of recording can capture the feeling. I stopped clicking and just stood at the foot and looked up and itâs a dream! Forget everything and look at it! You feel at once lost and above anything else!  People here seem to pay a lot of attention to beauty, love and experience.   THEY LIVE!  Merci.
As if I command the sunrise and sunset, I planned to visit all over the 2nd and 3rd arrondissements of the city of paris! So I took the map which I had bought earlier and noted down the important landmarks in those areas.It read like this: 1.Notre Dame Church, 2.Beauborg district (a book said that itâs the most picturesque place in Paris), 3.Ile de la Cite, 4.Quartier Latin, 5.Top of the Eiffel Tower, 6.Ile Saint-Louis. This seems to be a short list!  When I reached Notre Dame Church it was already 1pm, since I woke up very late!  Notre Dame church is an architectural feat! And it has been carved in the early 14th century. When I was in there , I could not realize the historic importance of that building. If you do not know a bit of history of Paris and its monuments, its of almost no use visiting them except for their picturesque beauty! It has witnessed great historic moments like the crowning of King Napolean to the most recent one like the visit of King Narayan I !  I have always wondered why does a human being require an institution like religion and more strangely an institution like marriage! Its quite perplexing if I go looking for an answer! It seems to me a pre-historic question which should not be pondered upon in the post-modern 21st century where its taken for granted by majority that these institutions are indispensable part of a human life! Quite strange! But in spite of having not an answer for this question , I realize Notre Dame church epitomizes the importance given to a religion by the kings and the commons, verisimilar to the attention that the temples in south India had received.  Before getting into the church I circumambulated around the building to record its beauty. It has intricate carvings with a lot of detail. Outside the church there's a wonderful garden. Before again reaching the entrance to get into the church, I went into a small gift shop and bought some souvenirs which were quite cheap by money but pretty rich with meaning. I donât buy things like this very often. I consider them junk .But this time they had some meaning to be transferred!  Then I went into the church. There was some prayer going on. The hall looked gloomy and tall with lot of arches on the roof. Nothing much to see inside. The carvings, a placard said were done in mid-14th century! It had those colourful stained-glass paintings. I got bored inside. Things like these look pretty outside, but internally they stink with rotten meaninglessness!  When I came out of the church it was 4pm and I had to buy vegetables and other cookeries at Gare Du Nord and had to visit the top of the eiffel tower. I had to ditch the idea of visiting all other places since that shopping will take a couple of hours and I should be there at the top before sunset to capture the view both at daylight and artificial lights. I went to the Eiffel tower. There was a huge rush and I thought it would take a couple of hours to even get the ticket and then ditched that idea too and went to Gare du Nord, bought some vegetables and returned to the room.  But amidst these I roamed around the Beauborg district , before going to Eiffel tower. As far as I have seen Paris and that place, its certainly not the most picturesque one! Bastille seems to be a very good place, with peaceful gardens, to live at.  When I was walking along these streets I saw an old woman who looked like some 40 years old. She was almost half-naked and with a lot of facial make-up. At the first sight I thought she was waiting for somebody, just like anybody else and my pace of walk was quite normal. Then within another furlong, I saw another woman in the same state. Another one...another one...Now I realised who they were!! Some were young too! I had a lot of money in my pocket. There's nobody in that part of the world who would recognize my identity. All alone in that atmosphere! I could do it if I want! Then a strange fear crept inside my mind. I cannot explain to myself why I felt like that. Freedom and fear, I thought are quite opposite. But here I experienced both these seemingly mutually exclusive emotions at once. That increased my pace of walk. I got out of that place as soon as I can! Even now I feel that pace!  There was another incident which affected me this day. When I was metro-ing towards Eiffel Tower I guess, there came a violinist-beggar inside the cabin where I was sitting. By now, I am used to these metro-beggars who play some music and ask for money and the kind of body-build and the faces and eyes they possess. Opposite to me there sat a man whose eyes cannot concentrate on a place for long. His hair was disheveled and his eyes rotund. He was holding a new tome in his hand. I could read from his face that he doesnât have what it takes to read a book! He opened the book and started reading. Within a second he flipped through the pages and looked at me who was staring at him! He kept on flipping the book like that as if he lost his golden ring somewhere in between the pages! My guess was right! He cannot read a book.  In the meanwhile the violinist had been playing his tune. His eyes looked quite strange. There was no sign of begging. He was adroit with that instrument. But this is not unusual since he might have played the same piece of music a thousand times before. His face impressed me. He looked like a normal guy who might as well be working as a software engineer! I felt from his eyes that he could take up my job and he would do better than myself and definitely I cannot play that violin like that! He ended his play. Took out a ticket pocket that we have for having our photo and the monthly pass and used it to collect the coins that people gave him. The train stopped at the station where I had to get down. I took an euro and gave it to him! I still cant believe that I dropped an euro to a beggar. I had never dropped a coin to a beggar even in India! If you have read and digested Ayn Rand, a beggar cannot impress you. And if you are impressed by one, he cannot be a beggar! I was sure that he didnât want money just to exist but to live. So I decided so. He too got down in the same station and I asked him to pose for a photo. He did and eagerly looked at the image I had captured in the camera. He said 'merci' and walked away without turning back. I took the map to read about the next train I had to take. I could not read it. My throat was choked with a heavy heart.I sat in the nearby bench and tears started oozing out of my eyes.I somehow controlled them so that they do not wet my sweater! It took me some time to get back to normal. There is something really wrong with either that fellow or the society in which he lives.  The day ended with these many things worth recording!  The next day I decided to take a walk along the banks of river seine. This river is seen as the reason for the birth of this historic city. I hoped that the sceneries would be good to  capture. Unusually, I was not dismayed. I started at the station of Gare de Lyon and from there started walking along the banks. Surely the panoramic views with the bridges, the Notre Dame church and the Eiffel Tower far away, is a sight that one should not miss. It was so beautiful. I could not believe in that heavenly beauty. What a fantastic scene! I tried my level best to capture them in my camera.  Along the banks of the river are the church and the Concierge building and Musee de Orsay museum and if we cut a little bit farther from the banks then and there we can see good monuments (of whose identity I am unaware) and pillars and statues. I came to the church and thought of getting inside again!  There are a lot of second-hand book sellers along this bank near the church who also sell paintings and covers of old magazines and posters of historic importance. There were a lot of books, but very few in English.  I saw a couple of pictures of Einstein with his quotes: 'Imagination is more important than Knowledge' 'If you have trouble with your Mathematics, do not worry. I have greater ones with mine!' Coincidentally, the day the 14th of March was Einstein's birthday. I thought he is right. A man can live a life without knowledge. Its no sin. But if he is living without imagination and artistic expression then he's no more a human being. I thought, 'Knowledge is Present. Imagination is Future'.  Just before the entrance I saw a man who was inviting people to be drawn as caricatures of themselves. I thought its a good idea to have a caricature of myself drawn. After a bit of argument that guy settled for 10 euros.Surprisingly, I said ,'Go Ahead'! I sat before him for some 10 minutes. He asked me to look at the side to get a good view of my facial features. I could see the picture he was drawing in his glasses! 'Where are you from? London?', he asked! 'India'. 'What are you doing? Student?' 'Software Engineer'. I felt a bit strange. When I look myself in the mirror I cannot believe that I am a software engineer. The notion of a student is, I think, better suits me and well deserved, because I have a lot to learn. He finished it and it was not what I wanted. I said thanks to him. Took a picture of him. While walking back to home , I tore away the picture and deleted his photo from my camera, since I didnât like the thing! I cursed myself for wasting 10 euros just like that. I thought I would like a portrait of myself rather than a caricature which follows the whim of the artist.  While taking a walk inside the church, looking for anything that I had missed the last day. The same boring religious drawings and paintings! But still the church from outside is worth looking at!  After walking along the banks for a few hours, I returned to my room to re-fuel myself. Then I went to the Eiffel Tower to go to the top of it. I thought there would be  a mad rush since its Sunday and I was there around 5pm so that I could watch Paris from the top of it. To my surprise there were few people. In another half-an-hour I went to the top. I am an acrophobic and I was alone! I thought that anyway even children are there and there would be enough safety measures. There were and I didnât feel any fear at the top. I discovered that my fear is not the height itself, but in climbing the height. Since it was inside a lift with lot of people , I didnât feel the fear. But I could not take the stairs due to that fear!  At the top of the Eiffel tower, the view although not as beautiful as anything as looked at from the ground, it was a good one. Nothing special about Paris. I thought if Bangalore had an Eiffel Tower then it might look as good too! The only thing worth capturing from that height is the flow of the river Seine. I waited for skyline to get dark. Unfortunately it was a cloudy day and I could not see the sunset properly. It was really chill and very windy at the top. But I was there for around 3 hours just to see Paris, the city of lights, lit. It drizzled a little too!  After it got dark completely, and when the whole city was lit, it was a good sight to behold. But its very difficult to capture those details in a camera. But I tried. And in that chill breeze, even though I was wearing woolen gloves, my fingers were trembling and the pictures I was taking, shaking! I would go to a calm place there, warm myself, take a picture and then go back!  I cannot forget the couples who kept on kissing each other standing at the zenith of the tower. I wondered why do they come to the top of the tower and try this stunt in this unbearable weather. They could very well do that in the warmth of their bedrooms with much more savour! I am kind of getting really annoyed of these French kisses. Indeed, couples who travel in metros do not waste their time. They keep kissing , happily ignoring the public. I kind of like that care-free attitude. To watch a beautiful couple kiss each other at such close quarters, as inside a lift, within a feet away from you, is a sight to be savoured every second! A note of a trip to Paris is not complete if it doesnât talk about the French kisses, I guess! So now I have done that!  After taking enough of pictures, I came down.  So this weekend ended this way!  I think slowly the Paris-fever is running down!
The weekdays rolled on too fast to me that at the end of it I realized that the weekend was not planned properly. I just thought I would visit the 'village' Paris.  This week was a bit boring.  The theme of 'village' Paris included the area stretching from Montmatre to Batignolles and the museums Musee de la vie Romantique and Musee de la Eroticisme.  I was wondering what would be a 'funiculaire' train. At the foot of the Butte Montmartre, there's this train which could take us to the top of it where the church of Sacre-Couer sat. Its a kind of a coach on rollers on an inclined plane. I took the stairs anyway, not wanting to part with my euros. The church was beautiful. The weather was very cloudy. From the top of the hill, I had a good panoramic view of a part of Paris equivalent to what I saw from the second stage of Tour Eiffel. Lots and lots of tourists. Most of them were speaking English. Maybe one of the reasons why the guy who drew a caricature of mine asked if I am from London!  I went inside the church just to see if there's anything worth seeing! To my dismay, nothing. All of the glory of any monument here, seems to be interwoven with its history. Without that its just another good piece of a building. After the prayer was over, it was good to see people shaking hands with whoever sat around them for the prayer. I was surprised to see a placard in Tamil asking the devotees for donation towards the water and electricity of the church. Thought that there are many Tamilians around there to visit the church. Maybe SriLankans, as there are plenty of them in Gare Du Nord. There were a couple of street-musicians as usual there too.  Beside the church, thereâs 'Place du Tertre' where were a gathering of artists who drew everything from caricatures to portraits to landscapes. Different types of them too. Indeed to watch them paint and to see their finished work was really fantastic and awe-inspiring. One artist told me that he needed 50 euros to draw a portrait of mine. I withdrew. But the prices vary greatly depending on the type you need. For  sometime I thought of getting a portrait of mine  done. But I thought its too costly.  To go to the museums, the map said that I had to get down the hill and walk a bit further.  When I got down the hill where the narrow street led to a wide road across, a big building stared at me with its huge neon sign reading 'sexodrome'! I was taken aback a bit. An English lady screamed to her husband, 'how the hell did we reach  this hell of a place? the sex place!!'. Both sides of the road were full of sex shops hosting live shows, peep shows.... Quite a strange sight for me who has only seen streets dedicated to jewellery, garments and the like!  I realized that I am in Pigalle.  The street was demarcated by the two metro stations Pigalle and Blanche.  Took a slow walk along the walkway to see the shops. The pictures that were displayed outside the shops, glaring at the passersby were quite obscene- the kind of pictures that are banned even in cyber cafes in India! Pornography is quite public here!  I thought that people who live here, can come to this place, perform the sin, go up the hill to the church and confess it and go back home purified! Quite a smart way to live indeed!  Along the road was the Musee de la Eroticisme! It was a small building. I entered it and saw that the entree[sic] fee was 7 euros. I looked around. The room was full of lewd statues and porno. Surely, I donât want to spend my money here!  Then while walking down the street, a woman who was wooing the pedestrians into a shop, came running and said 'Excuse me, Sir' and began to pour out words in French. I didnât turn back to her fearing that that might be taken as a sign of approval! I almost started running! Its quite a disgusting place.  I thought that I should not buy sex. Instead I should earn it. If I earn it, then it means that it comes with love and it'll take me to heaven. If I buy it, it'll become an indelible thorn of steel in my heart and given the kind of character I am, it would surely kill me! Its so fatal. So I'll better remain away from this. But the problem is, I always think that I am not smart enough to 'earn' it. There's a great probability that I'll be a failure in this regard. Its very rare to come across people who earn their sex. The majority satisfy their appetite either by buying it or begging for it or settling for something cheap. I do not want to do anything of these.  And when I think of Love, I realize that its so elusive that those who seek it will not find it. The choice is not ours but Her's!  The 'Moulin Rouge' which was glorified by the eponymous Hollywood flick, starring Nicole Kidman, is in this street. I went to the street again the next day night to take a picture of that windmill placed on that mall, lit. While taking the picture and returning back too, I was accosted by a man who showed a shining card and pointed to a narrow street nearby and said 'there are beautiful girls there, sir?'. Instead of running away, this time I paused and  said, 'No.Thanks'! After all, he too is a human being and in a sense, we both are beggars! The boredom which I go through is making me one!  Getting quite repugnant of the place and thinking of seeing those artists again at the top, I went to Place du Tertre and then to the church. There I sat at the steps. I was sweating due to the uphill climb and I took off the jacket and felt the chill air on my warm wet skin.  At this moment, I couldnât quite grasp why, I felt really completely lonely. The old feeling of boredom which used to kill me while I was in Bangalore got its grip again on me! I felt tired and bored of the whole thing! Paris has failed to remove this sense of boredom from me. Then I started pondering about my favourite, unanswerable, ever-mysterious question of my career. Till now, I could not find what would enthuse me.  It seems that my mind is altogether inconsonant with whatever I experience, be it anywhere, anytime! I desperately want to find something which resonates with my mind. Or else its better to die, than going through this boredom and loneliness and the feeling of worthlessness. I am sure that with this sense of detachment to anything I cannot achieve anything in my life and am already a failure. But somehow this fact doesnât seem to bother me. I always think that its perfectly fine to be a failure. Maybe thatâs one of the reasons why I cannot find what I really want out of my life. Everything still looks meaningless, even though they are beautiful!   After resting outside the church, I got up with no specific place in my mind and roamed around the streets of Montmartre, which they say had inspired even some of the great thinkers who frequented the place. Quite a good place. Calm and serene. The narrow streets, typical of a village, without any tourist noise are good to be in.  Later in the evening I went to the village of Belleville just to see whatâs there. But when I got out of the metro station onto the roads, the first impression of that place and the smell of it wasnât good. To forget that hangover, I went to the 'timeless' Paris again, where I've been last week, to take a picture of Pont Neuf across river Seine lit in the night. As I expected, that place had a magic touch! I felt good again. Took some pictures and returned to my room.  Since I was bored this day I thought going of nowhere the morrow and went to sleep!  While returning to my room, in the metro, I saw a person who can neither be called a boy nor a man. Somewhere in between, like me. I liked his countenance. Lots of hair, clean cut of his nose and a 2-day old beard. He was reading a book and when I saw it I envied him! It was Victor Hugo's Les Contemplations. I felt like learning French to read Victor Hugo, Voltaire , Rene Descartes and the like - the kind of men who are keeping me alive and who make me realize that thereâs nothing to get bored and thereâs a universe to learn and contemplate upon. Its a  never-ending quest! I only wish to ask them, 'THEN WHAT?'!  I couldnât sleep beyond broad daylight at 7:30AM.And again got bored of the room! So I went to Musee de la vie Romantique and Jardin du Luxembourg.   The museum, unlike what the name suggests, was not at all romantic! In fact I found boring portraits of the Rouart family of artists and a not at all beautiful woman artist called George Sand and the materials they used and even their hair sample! I wrote in the visitor's book 'Nothing romantic about this!'. Got really pissed off.  At times, while strolling around this paradise, I feel a bit of wonder to think that I am at the opposite side of the world , so far from India, wearing the same jeans and T-shirt which I wore in Bangalore. And I feel a bit of sadness when I realise that I had to return! Dreams only last until you realize that they are dreams! Now the dream has ceased to be.  I expected the garden of Luxembourg to be huge and beautiful. But it was pretty small, even though beautiful. Spent some time there and then went to Gare du Nord as usual to buy cookeries with my roommates Amarnath and Srinand and returned to the room.
Last weekend turned out to be another memorable weekend for me.  I thought that I have exhausted Paris and there's nothing more to see in it. I am grateful for Marc, who explained about the places to see in Paris and made me realize that I had barely seen Paris and there's a lot to be discovered and who guided to me to a bookstore in La Defense where I bought a guide. I had to start my sight-seeing almost from the scratch to be comprehensive.  So this week my plan was to cover: 1.Ile de la Cite 2.The Marais 3.Beauborg and Les Halles 4.Tuileries Quarter. But I couldnât go to the last one for want of time.  It seems that every week I had to start with a church! So now it was St.Chapelle. The church, even though not as huge as Notre Dame, was quite impressive in its architecture. It had two chapels on 2 stages. The lower one was meant for the commons and the upper one seems to have been used by the kings. The lower chapel wasnât quite attractive except for its roof which had many arches and was in a bright blue colour. A narrow circular staircase led to the upper chapel. Wow! It was so colourful and full of stained-glass paintings. But the tourists who were quite large in number made a hell lot of noise and the building reverberated it to my annoyance! I tried to take a good picture of the rose-window which depicts the scenes from old and new testaments. But my camera's zoom wasnât good enough. One of the faces of the apostles there attracted me a lot with the calm in its face, carved so beautifully! You have to believe in something or the other to attain that calm or else you'll be pushed into eternal chaos and void. I would like to have a hairstyle and beard like that. If not for the damn tourists' noise I would have sat there for much more time. Felt that the environment was very good to sit and contemplate on something.  The marche aux fleurs et oiseaux (market of flowers and birds) was quite a treat for the eyes. It seems that the island was once famous for its flower markets and this is one of the very few left! There was a shop beside this for decorative items. The items were so beautiful that I wanted to build a house just to host them there!  Then I went through Rue de Arcole  which was full of souvenir shops to reach Notre Dame church. There were a few places there which I had missed earlier. Those are the point zero mark - from where all the distances within France are measured and crypte archeologique underneath which there are relics which are almost 2000 years old.I was looking for the statues of Gargoyles (chimeras) when I had been there before and found them now atop the walls of Notre Dame. Again my camera zoom was not powerful enough to capture them in close-up.  The woman who was in charge of the public toilet of Notre Dame church affected me a bit. She had quite a pleasant smile on her face always and she looked like an Indian. She was guiding the people to a free-cabin in the toilet. I thought nobody could have a passion for such a job and still she manages a smile.  Every street in Paris has a historic lusture. I was amazed to see a street sign on Rue de Francois-Bourgeois which pointed to 3 museums in 3 directions. Thought that one day or the other the residents of Paris will be evacuated for want of place for hosting the museums. So many of them.  I cannot forget Musee Picasso for the rest of my life for the impact it had had on me. I was quite half-hearted when I paid and entered the museum. But slowly I began to realize the genius of Picasso. It was so intense that it could pierce my ignorance of art. Mind-blowing imagination. Until then, my perspective of art and painting was that its just drawing portraits and landscapes and caricatures and theres no intelligence or analytical thinking involved in it. But many of the paintings that I could comprehend made me realize that I was egregious to an abysmal  extent. At first many of the paintings are quite inscrutable. I read the placards placed in front of each of the rooms explaining the importance of the exhibits and the phase of life of Picasso in which he drew them. Combined with a bit of imagination and absurdity, slowly I could decipher a few of them and those had a profound impact on me. What if I could understand everything? I would go mad! I used to think that only symmetry in objects and paintings would be beautiful. For once and forever I realized total incongruity can also be beautiful insofar as they depict the concept handled by the artist and the depth of it. I could see that at the start as an artist he too was drawing normal pictures and as he aged he paintings involved more and more abstraction. And also the subjects of the paintings like bull-fight, war, romance, sex, illness, death et al reflect the agony of their creator. And it was quite interesting to know that his wife ran away from him. Not surprising. They say that theres a woman behind every man's success. They forgot to add that he has to overcome that woman too to attain that success! They turn the simple task of life to an herculean one!  I was very much affected by a bronze piece of skull sculpted by him which reminded me of my mother's skull. Its still fresh in my memory and would be there till my head turns to one. The works which depicted illness, death, gruel war with dark and dull colours and which depict the frailty and ephemerality of life invoked sadness in me. Death is a subject which I am grappling with for quite sometime now and its unfathomable and quite disquieting! I believe that instead of trying to understand life by attacking it directly, I might get some light if I approach it by trying to comprehend its absence, death. They are two sides of the same coin. One inevitably leads to the other!  After going through most of his works and a bit of his biography I was wondering how could this world understand his complex conceptual works and allow him to rise to prominence. He is a genius inasmuch as he found a language to express his emotions. I was very much amused to see a group of little girls debating which leg belonged to which face in a painting and an elderly girl trying to guide them and make them realize the picture. I am ashamed of my ignorance of art.  Another part of the museum had his sculptures. They were works of a creative genius in Picasso. I've read about the bull-head created with a bicycle-seat and handlebar. To see that and to see many others like a goat's stomach made of a waste basket and a child in a trolley made out of iron pipes and pots was quite intriguing. It takes a genius to bring simplicity in chaos. This is exactly my state of mind - utter chaos and I am afraid I do not have the intelligence to discern the simple and eternal concepts behind them which runs this universe.  One more reason why I was annoyed with myself is my ignorance of the meaning of colours. If only I had that knowledge, I could fathom much more of Picasso. My heart and mind was full with pleasure when I came out of the museum for the only reason that I had discovered another language of expression. Quite a treat!   Then I went to the garden in Places des Vosges. Its beautiful with the surrounding buildings. There were lots of children playing there. And there were a group of violinists playing at a corner. There was a rush to hear to them. I envied those children very much. There's so much of art, music, poetry around and surely many of them would grow up as artists, poets, philosophers and musicians. No seed in a child would die of starvation of imagination and expression. Its a very appealing ambience.  In 6,Places des Vosges is Maison de (house of) Victor Hugo. There were a lot of paintings of his and the manuscripts and old posters of his shows were on exhibit inside. I didnât know that he could paint. Everybody seems to have some knowledge of art and music. Its very bad that I didnât study them. But many of the paintings depicted poverty and illness and other somber subjects. I didnât quite like them. I would have appreciated if he had depicted glory and heroism. I equate him to those qualities. But it felt good to visit that house where its said that he wrote most part of Les Miserables.  The whole of the next day I spent in the beauborg district with most of the time in Musee National d'Art Moderne in the Pompidou centre. I started my tour at the Pompidou centre. Its strikingly different than any other building I would ever see. In short its a building built inside out. All kinds of pipes, elevators, escalators are outside the building! The pipes outside the building were coloured distinctively to symbolize their function like ventilation, water, air-conditioning, electricity etc. The escalator which takes us to all the floors was set up across the facade of the building which was quite an attraction. At first, I was not interested in the modern art museum. But I could go to the top of the building only if I take a ticket to the museum! So I dropped the idea of going there to the top to take pictures. The centre hosts a cinema complex - playing kind of art pictures. And from 19March to 17April its Bollywood special! They were playing chaiyya chaiyya song in a TV and then I heard the Hindi version of a song from the Tamil film Kandukondein Kandukondein! In the library there dedicated to art and industrial design I was amazed to see a book on Indian films with Simran on its cover. And there was a book on photography which was dedicated to human genitals! Really crazy!  Beauborg district is very small but its very beautiful. Last time I've been to the wrong part of it and thats why I felt that it wasnt the most picturesque. Place Igor Stravinsky, very near to the pompidou centre, has a lot of so-called modern fountains which were quite funny to look at. They seemed not to have been maintained well. Many werent working properly. But the place looked colourful.  Besides this place, there's St.Merry church. I went inside to see the old 13th century pulpit. The church was quite small. Many churches here have the look of Notre Dame.  Then I went to Fountain des Innocents and Forum les Halles. Forum les Halles is quite intriguing in that it has a garden at the ground floor and a big shopping complex, cinema complex , swimming pool, gymnasium in the floors below the garden! The building which surrounded the garden was pretty to look at.  After going to all these places, I entered into the Pompidou centre again.Got the ticket for the museum and went to the top!But I was dismayed to see that I could not get out of the closed glass escalators to the terrace or anywhere to take clear pictures.I could only take pictures from inside that glass tube!Then I went to the modern art museum!It turned out to be another lesson for me, like Musee Picasso.  Many paintings were quite indiscernible. The paintings were like scribblings of a kindergarten kid hung in the name of contemporary art! It was quite funny. But I was bemused very much with the works of artists called Cesar, Sigmar Polke(for Pasadena), Andy Warhol (for Electric Chair), Jean Pierre Raynaud(for Container Zero), Opalka (for Details).I could not quite understand container zero and pasadena. I noted all these names and works for investigating a bit on them! I myself felt strange. Many works which involved optical illusion and compression mechanics were also intriguing. Roman Opalka's details is a bit weird. The painting is nothing but a series of numbers. But the importance of it comes from the meaning given to it. Opalka seems to have wanted to do something that would only die with him and uptill then keep on evolving! So he decided to write numbers on a board. He started from 1 and I do not know where he ended. Only part of his work was on display. I could see numbers like 3309916, 5131330 and so on. When he finished one board of numbers he would take a photograph of himself. I think the total work includes a dozen boards. The colour of the board gets lighter and lighter starting from gray. The numbers are in white. So as he gets older, it becomes more and more difficult to read the numbers. What a crazy idea! I was wondering how much he should have been affected by death and the finiteness of life to make him take up this kind of a work.  Another artist that I should mention is Yaacov Agam. His is a fantastic idea. He hated the static nature of art and succeeded in bringing dynamism in it by involving time and motion. They call it kinetic art. A room was dedicated to one of his works. In a room, 3 sides , the floor and the ceiling contain some strange patterns. One side is ofcourse open for us to see! For once I was lost. I thought this is another one that I could not understand even a bit. But the silver ball placed at the centre of the room explained everything and the genius of Yaacov. I saw patterns of circles and diamonds and various other shapes. As you walk from one end of the face of the room to another you see the pattern changing! What a genius! What kind of painstaking imagination! Superb! That was indeed my favourite.  But my body got tired and hungry and I had to leave the centre to my room!  So this week turned out to be a week that awakened me towards art.Picasso and Yaacov Agam have lit the light!  There are abundant languages to express oneself. And I think the best and perfect among them is SILENCE.
This weekend I didnt spend much time outside and from the few places I went, the predominant theme seemed to be, my pet pondering, Death.   I started at Place de la Concorde.Its a majestic square.Only one side of it has a building and all the other sides are open.There were two fountains in the middle with 8 statues each symbolising the french cities.The star attaraction of the square is the 3200 year old (!!!) Luxor Obelisk.With the Eiffel tower not far behind, it adds to the scenic seduction, I should say.  Very near is Jardin des Tuileries.A beautiful garden.Its better than the one in Luxembourg quarter.Here I was accosted by a boy who had a similar build like mine but far younger than me. 'Excuse me,Sir.Do you know English?'.  I thought he's going to ask me the way to somewhere for which I had a prepared answer, 'Sorry.I am a foreigner!'. But he asked me to read a card,which read,'I am staying with my mother and brother here.We are from...(I forgot!).My father died in Bosnia.We are starving.Please give me some money'. These were not the exact words,but the meaning is intact. I read and looked at his face. 'Sorry!' and smiled.I still do not know why I smiled then! These kind of acquaintances, although very short, kindles my mind very much and makes me ask seemingly silly questions for which I have no answers and I had to decide that I went by instinct rather than reason, which is very sub-standard for a rational being. After enjoying the garden, I proceeded to Palais Royal and the surrounding garden. Nothing very attractive.  To go to the palace, I had to go through Rue de Rivoli. At the middle of it is the statue of Joan of Arc. It reminded me of the movie with Milla Jovovich as the protaganist. I liked her figure and the way she portrayed the character. Fantastic. Rue de Rivoli is magnificent and imperial. You suddenly forget that you are in a very modern city and feel like being in a period where an emperor rules the country. This is not the only place where I get that feeling, since Paris is painstakingly maintaining her countenance. They donât allow buildings to soar so that all the monuments and other historically precious places are prominent in the skyline. Thatâs why when I look Paris from the top of any tower or a monument, I get a feel of being in 18th century with all its kingly glory. The road has a lot of shops and I went into a few of them, just to see whatâs in there and how the shopkeeper looks like!  The second part of my day was spent in the Latin quarter. I think they are the prettiest streets of Paris in the evening with lots of boutiques and restaurants. It was very busy.  Then I landed in the place of the day, the Pantheon. The facade looks like the pantheon of greece. I pitied the poverty of the imagination of its architect. But its supposed to be an architectural feat. All I could reason for that feat is its difficult to place 2 huge domes on top of one another with lot of room in between and support them with only 4 pillars which form the end-points of the 4 aisles, with the plan of the building looking like a cross with a circle at the intersection of the cross. They call this kind of mix of Greek and Gothic architecture as neo-classical style! It means that its neither new nor classic. Its a confusion. But the facade with this greek Pantheon-like pillars and the peristyle of the lower dome , looked royal.  The space inside is vast.The place is the necropolis of the great french personlities. The names I could recognize where Saint Genevieve(the patron saint of Paris, who (she) is said to have saved Paris once from an attack of some barbarians),Victor Hugo, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Marie & Pierre Curie .I couldnât go to the main place called the Crypt, which hosts the tombs below the chancel, for I had arrived there lately. In the middle of the space, at the intersection of the four transepts, is suspended the Foucault pendulum, right from the centre of the dome. I have to study what its all about! The walls had a lot of big backed pictures and pendentives. The spiral staircases took me, with lot of other tourists, to the peristyle, to have a panoramic view of Paris.I asked to take a picture of mine with the Eiffel tower far behind, in the colonnade, to the lady who guided us to the top. I gave her clear instructions on how the picture should come and where I and the tower should feature. She invariably messed it up! Somehow cameras or the photographers screw up my photos. All the passport photos which I had ever taken, except for the one in my Nortel ID here, have suffered this. Every photographer and camera seem to conspire against my face! So I ditched her and gave the camera to a tall guy and gave the same instructions. To my surprise, he took it almost as I wanted. I was happy. 'Where are you from?', he asked. 'India. Bangalore'. 'I am from Mexico'. Then I heard the guide cry something in french. I thought he is explaining something and ignored it and was immersed in a bit of day-dreaming. After a couple of minutes, when I realized where I was, there were nobody around. When I looked down, all the other tourists had went down. I could see them on the terrace down there. There was a door open. Then I came around the place to see if anybody else is there. When I reached that door again to go down. It was locked. For a moment I feared being left there. I started yelling 'hello' towards the stairs hoping that somebody would hear me. No reply for a couple of minutes. I pushed the button which was besides the door thinking that its some kind of an alarm. No reply for that too. Then I turned back. All the tourists were still standing there staring at me yelling. One of them shouted that the guide is on her way. I felt relieved.  Then I roamed around the latin quarter streets for sometime. Her I came across a treasure trove! Shakespeare & Co! At last I have found a book shop which sells good English books! It was very old. I forgot that the guide book had mentioned about this. There was an odd-tempered very old man owning the shop. The shop too looks pretty old. Theres a reference library in the first floor of the shop. Earlier I had seen one more bookshop in that quarter. But the books were all of those not so meaningful subjects like engineering and technology and science. But this one dealt only with those soulful, and hence comparatively although not completely meaningful subjects like philosophy, literature and art! I bought Les Miserables. When I came out of the shop it started drizzling and I returned to my room.  The next day I roamed around Montparnasse. Hell lot of theatres. Every street atleast has a couple of cinema theatres. And some sex boutiques too. Should look lively in the night. I saw Tour Montparnasse, which was, when it was built, one of Europe's tallest towers. This, I guess is the only skyscraper in the heart of Paris. All others are in the outskirts like La Defense. I didnât go up the tower for it would have set me back by 8 euros!  The next place in my plan was to visit Cimetiere du Montparnasse (The cemetery of ...), one of Paris's biggest cemeteries. It hosts the tombs of many french prominent personalities across all the fields. I went to see the one of the famous existentialist couple, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, the couple I most envy. They dominated the 19th century philosophic and literary scene of France. I took a couple of small stones from their tomb as memento mori! Some names I would recognize there were Guy de Maupassant and Henri Poincare. I wondered at the man's thirst to be remembered even after death when I saw some strangely designed tombs. I wanted to see the whole of the cemetery but I had to go to Catacombs by 2PM and so I rushed through it.  For the first time, the map in my guide showed a wrong pointer to a place. Because of that I have to disturb some localites there to arrive at the  place of Catacombs. This is a very special place! Napolean, once wanted to clear all the cemeteries in Paris and clean up the city. So he dug up all those and stored all the remains of dead bodies under some 3 'mont's of Paris. One of those is Montparnasse and the place where he put all of the remains is called Catacombs.  I had to go down a seemingly unending spiral staircase to go to the underground storage place. Once my head started rolling and I had to stop for a moment to regain myself! At the entrance there's a warning asking weak-hearted and weak-bodied people not to take the journey!  Then I had to walk some 2 kms underground to arrive at the storage place. The walkway was very narrow and fearful, if alone. Thousands and thousands of skulls and bones. Wow! what a sight to see! Good that I didnât miss this. For the next 2 kilometres of the maze-like dark alleys which were dimly lit, wherever you turn you see the skulls staring at you. I was petrified at the collection! In some places the underground water was seeping through the roof, making the walk even more difficult. For the next hour or so all I saw were those skulls, the emblem of Death. This is one of those places where I want to go again for I forgot to take a picture of myself with full of skulls and bones in the background. It would have been a marvelous photo.  Then again to come up to the city, I had to enervatingly climb those stairs. I was a lot relieved to see sunlight and brightness! And I was a kilometre or further from where I entered and I had to search my way back.  I was satisfied with the treat of these places and ended my weekend stroll!  Mother Death, it seems, is waiting for me to get matured to reveal herself! Till then I'll enjoy the fun and freedom of being immature.
With thoughtful books to read, With soulful music to hear, With beautiful places to stroll, With intellectual art and sculpture to tickle my mind, Paris is a paradise!  Sitting at the banks of River Seine, Wear Lucky Ali on your ears, Hold the little finger of Victor Hugo and ask him to walk you through his woods of ideas and now you know how heaven would feel like!  Wanting a change from monuments, churches and museums, I started my weekend with Bois de Bologne. Its a huge garden. Its the remains of a forest which was beside Paris which is well tended now. The atmosphere was absolutely serene, far away from the din and bustle of the traffic and noise of any tourists. Its the best an ultra-cosmopolitan city can do to take its citizens close to nature. There were many people seen around. They had come with their kids and pets and were having their time. You should be an idiot of a bachelor, like me, to go to such a heavenly place, alone without a girlfriend!  There were ponds in between with calm water with birds and ducks and pigeons. I roamed around for some time to drink the beauty and then settled in a calm shady place. I was disturbed by that calmness! To face silence has become difficult for me, for I have to face myself and my stupid questions. Men cant easily live in silence and solitude for they dread to be denuded by that one-word interrogation upon oneself which they have no guts or patience to face. So many prefer to inundate themselves into noise for that reason and die without ever attempting to answer that eternal query.  In the park, I could see a couple of young beautiful girls jogging, a married (hopefully!) couple, an old lady walking with a middle-aged man; maybe her son. How many roles do women play in a man's life from birth to death, I wondered! And I always wonder about the inherent duality of nature. Why should there be men and women? Why did not human beings choose to be asexual? And why should I allow this duality to screw up my life?! But without this duality, I realise that this world which has progressed from molecules to men, would have remained inert and be impotent of any reaction and procreation. Conflict is indispensable for creating harmony. But I donât understand why should there be any progress or procreation in the first place. Why should there be something? Why not nothing? Isnât that calmer? Isnât that more peaceful? Isnât that beauty? Why should I exist and experience chaos? I dont know. I am clueless. But all I can fathom is Chance and Change are twin directors of life and Love its producer! And I, the actor. How colourful it is, even though meaningless!  There were a lot of children playing around in the garden. I envied them a lot, as I did in Places des Vosges. I felt that this is quite a good environment for children to be brought up. India is not a good place for children to grow up and get educated. Not only that the educational system is hopelessly marred by the mud-headed politicians, but there's a complete dearth of role-models to look up to for kids; dearth of soaring of human spirit, dearth of order, dearth of discipline, dearth of planning and perfection. Children should definitely not be educated in such a place. Their mind would become crippled with the narrowness of their vision. The fundamental and primary objective  of a teacher is to show the ideal and then to teach how to go and attain it. But this happens rarely in Indian schools. No teacher is worth his salt. I have come across only three of the breed of good teachers in my school life, who deserve some respect. India is against the grain to impart soulful knowledge. All it can achieve is to produce meaningless software engineers like me! The calm of Bois de Bologne disturbed me a lot and I walked back to my room, not wanting to disturb myself further and in the evening I walked along Champs-Elyssees with amar and srinand, looking for a compact flash card for my camera and to enquire about the prices of cellphones for suneetha.  Musee Rodin hosts the works of the master sculptor Auguste Rodin. Its placed in one of the 'finest town houses of Paris'. The 'Gates of Hell' welcomed me. Its a very famous work of Rodin and I wondered how the hell he put all these pieces of bronze together. The house had a marvellous and big garden around it were the masterpieces of Rodin are kept. I couldnât understand why the other sculptures were regarded as anything wonderful, thanks to my blissful ignorance.  Le Penseur (The Thinker) attracted me a lot, if not for any of its scuplting brilliance which I am incognizant of, for its simplicity and profound meaning.At the first sight it reminded me of Rene Descartes's 'Cogito ergo sum'.He is an exemplary thinker, who set out to build an entire philosophical system from scratch, not believing in any misleading logic, but his own reasoning. I was quite stunned to look at a photograph of him, for he shattered my pet ideas of physiognomy. To put his idea succinctly, denuding the benumbing abstraction of philosophical parlance, he proved that the existence of self is beyond doubt and we exist because we think. He looked a bit ugly outwards(!) as opposed to Rodin who looks like a sage. All this came to my mind with that piece of scultpture. Its powerful. And its so fitting that Rodin's tomb is below this statue.  Inside the house, there are numerous works of Rodin. I liked those erotic statues very much, for their expression. There are only a handful of emotions experienced by human beings that are so severe that however refined is the form of art used to express them, it would never be complete. Sex is one of them. Sex is sublime. That exalted state can be experienced, I believe, if I can check my sixth sense. Thatâs the reason, I guess, that every sculptor, painter and musician tries his hand at it, to gauge his mastery, against the infinite!  When I see the statues nude and get out of the picture to see myself and all others dressed up and standing there, I feel odd. Itâs not the statues which look odd but its our dress! Its as if I dress to conceal my weak body with a frail frame. The statues make me feel ashamed.  In the afternoon, I had been to Tombeau de Napolean and Musee de l'Armee. The tomb (crypt)of the great emperor Napoleon I is kept inside a dome church. The church is quite majestic to look at. Did I read somewhere that it took 27 years to build that dome? What were they doing sitting on that rotunda for so long!!? But the gold gilded dome  with a cross at its zenith, with sun shining as best as He can through the clouds above Paris, it looks splendidly effulgent. Felt like entering the gates of Heaven after having seen the gates of hell at Musee Rodin! When I entered and beheld that massive dome from inside and the beautiful altar of a crucified guy called Jesus Christ, I felt that its quite a fitting place for that emperor's soul to rest in peace if at all it chooses so! Its quite amusing to note that he rose from obscurity to become a glorious emperor. He was extremely brilliant and is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. He is also one of the father's of Paris's beauty. If not for anything else I would remember him for being a part in sculpting such a beautiful city. Its a myth that he was short. He was 5'6.5' tall, average height, but half an inch short of mine! This character inspired me to proceed further into Musee de l'Armee where there are exhibits of things used by the Napoleon dynasty and is quite comprehensive. Itâs considered one of the best and wide collection in the world of the materials used in a war.  When I entered the museum I was still revelling in that erotic mood which Rodin has managed to create! But suddenly to switch the context from Love to War was difficult! It was quite a complete switch nevertheless, I should say. The museum educated me of the complexities involved in a war with all its exhibits of swords, daggers, pistols, guns, plaques, flags, epaulettes, uniforms, water-cans(!), heavy metal suits, iron masks, ornaments, bonnets, keys and various symbols used by the infantries and regiments. I was stunned by the administrative genius of Napoleon I.I was awe-struck when I came out of the floor. Sheer power. I felt very very puny before that emperor. He is what I call a Man. I felt sad that he was caught as a prisoner of war by England and was sent in exile to St.Helena on southern atlantic and died there. His remains were brought back here by King Louis XIV and was deposited in the Dome church. It was a bit ironic and saddening to see the set up of the prison room in which his soul departed with the bed and chairs originally used by him. He lived only for 52 years on this earth and see the legend he has left behind for us!  It was good to see that the seal of Napoleon I was N which is the first letter of Narayan, the King, too.  There was another floor dedicated to Napoleon III where I saw a rifle. The moment I saw it, I thought there should be something wrong with its design and it should have been very awkward to handle it. If I had been a soldier I would not have used such a rifle for anything. Its not good enough to kill in a swift way. Amazingly my suspicion was proved right by the plaque that read that it was an ill-designed lounge-rifle, with long bayonet (which was the root cause of my doubt!) at the end of the barrel, which was approved by the king and could not be used extensively and hence failed! So I observed that Napoleon III was not as good as his predecessors. Such is the incompetence that dynasty-rule produces. After this I got a bit pensive about the efficiency of the rulers in the systems of democracy and aristocracy. Terrorists do not jump from the skies onto the earth. They are the illustrious sons of democracy whose major achievement is producing incompetent and dumb-headed leaders who only know how to manipulate the sentiment of the majority to their whims. Democracy, in short is the mother of incompetence and corruption. Decisions at any level, from the individual to the government should not be taken by the majority. Majority of the decisions taken by the majority are hopelessly ignorant. Decisions and power should only reside with intellectuals and philosophers. All others, for the sake of good, should submit.  In the evening I didnât go anywhere. Amar and Srinand taught me how to roller-skate in an open space in La Defense. I had a good time! After 1 hour of practice, I know how to stand up on my own with the roller-skates on! I had a lot of times deliberately avoided many things for the fear of success. I donât fear failure that much for I am the personification of it! Then when I returned to my room I got a bit moody about success and failure.  Nobody succeeds unless and until he is aware of his success. And nobody fails unless and until he is aware of his failure. And if he is not aware of his failure, he loses the capacity to transmogrify a failure into a success. I bet that every man who had succeeded, in whatever way you define success, has failed marvelously. If he loves success, there has been umpteen moments when he has faced failure with love, for neither success nor failure is what he exactly loves, but the endeavour towards it. Its the journey that matters and bring true ecstasy, not the destination.  Here again I cant stop repining about my state. Even though I realize all the above, my problem is that I am not able to define my journey and make my sleeping spirit wake up and walk through it. Where there's no definite and conscious journey, all the so-called successes and failures fail to impress the soul. It starves. Journey is the soul of life. Destination is only as good as the body to the soul. As if I am standing uncontrollably on a roller-skates, which for the first time I wear on my feet and find it extremely difficult to get up and balance myself and almost impossible to thrust myself forward in a chosen direction, I am being pushed by the strong wind of chances which has any influence only upon those who have no sense of direction and is absolutely harmless for those who know where they are going, into the gates of hell. I feel that I am very near to those gates. But I can see that heaven is not far away but the next door!. Still I cant change my direction for I am stuck with the roller-skates on my foot which I had been wearing all along in my life, which is commonly called Ignorance. I feel like screaming to my throats capacity, for it would give me a ray of hope that somebody in heaven would heed me and take me under their wings. Hope! Unreasonably hope! 'You bastard, hope!', I tell to myself.  The next day I've been to a place where I long wanted to go after coming to Paris. Its Espace Montmartre which hosts the museum of the great surrealist Salvador Dali. Dali is considered as a genius in the art of surrealism. His strange mustache will itself tell you his character!  The first work which welcomed me was a famous Dalinian symbol of a fluid watch, which consists of a watch draped over a branch of tree. This flowing fluid image of a clock is the masterpiece of Dali which he exploits to the maximum extent. Its seen repeated in many more works of his. Dali's time is not precise, not rigid and it dances to our thoughts. Its subjective and an extension of human perception. He preaches, through his works, that man must learn to strike a balance between time and life, to maximize the gift of life.  There was a sculpture which depicted the nobility of time, with a woman symbolizing desire, reality and this material world and with an angel which is a simile for the deeply religious nature of a human being. In between these 2 there stands the Dali clock to preach that inspite of the other two feelings which drive man in his daily life, time reigns, with a crown on its head.  There were many more sculptures like 'Space Elephant' which were amusing. He uses egg to symbolize the intra-uterine life and re-birth. Thatâs a good idea!  I was able to appreciate even some of his paintings, thanks to the placards that were in English beside each sculpture and painting. He paints and tells stories in his own surrealistic way. He has painted Bible, Alice in Wonderland to name a few. When I was climbing up to reach the entrance, after I was done, I saw many poses of him with some questions and answers which were interesting. I could remember these: What is ugliness? Disorder. What is beauty? Harmony. Why do you wear (such a strange!) mustache? In order to pass unobserved! What is surrealism? Surrealism is myself. Do you think that a painter of your style belongs in our atomic era? Certainly. I personally indulge in atomic explosions.  After this I roamed around the beautiful Montmartre area in the streets back to the Sacre-Couer church. Then returned to my room and wonder about this subject of surrealism, which has always been with me, so beautifully portrayed by Dali. I thought that if his works are called and celebrated as works of a genius, I could produce thousands of ideas like those. After all I am a surrealist of myself!   N. (Inspired by Emperor Napoleon I and the '.' signifies that King Narayan is an end in himself!)
Thanks to Nellai(Nellaiappan Soundarrajan) for lending me his laptop to record my thoughts over the weekend.I missed gvim, for Windows always expects her users to be pretty dumb!  I would love to live and die in Paris for it treats me so well, even though I have no ideals to live upto or die for.   I was in Rue Mechain to start my weekend for the sake of Vidya, my teammate and friend.The administrative headquarters of the school in which she studied, the St.Joseph de cluny in Malleshwaram,Bangalore, is located here in Paris and she wanted me to get some photos of it.  The street was barren and it was drizzling a lot. I thought it would be a holiday and thought of taking some pictures of the street and the door of the building and return. Also since I could roam around only in the weekends, it would be difficult to come in the weekdays and satisfy her wish. After taking a couple of snaps I went near the door. It had no numeric keypad which most of the doors in the houses of Paris have, but a button to press. I hoped it was a calling bell. I heard a couple of rings on pressing it. No response. Slowly I pushed the door to see that it was opened. A receptionist welcomed me. I explained her the purpose of my being there. She asked me to wait for sometime and went away to fetch a sister. There was no school inside as opposed to my belief. But it was a mother house and it hosted a church.  While waiting for the sister, another sister turned up in that room and before I could grasp  her face completely, she thrust a T-shirt into my hand and said, 'Have it' and went away without waiting for any answer as if I am there to receive whatever they give! I didnât want to act rudely there. So I kept the T-shirt, for I should hand it over to Vidya, who was the root cause for it!  The sister whom I am supposed to wait for turned up and took me to a small meeting room. After my introduction, I came to know that her name was sister Violet and she is basically a Tamilian, whose family is in Bangalore and who is in Paris for 6 years now! She started conversing in Tamil. She took me to all the gardens and the church inside .She started with a tree whose seed was sown by the founder of the institution, St.Anne-Mary XYZ, which was almost 200 years old. Beside the church is the crypt (the tomb) of the founder. She said that in the box kept there, the heart of the lady is preserved! Then she showed me the office buildings and the sisters' residence.  Then when we were walking along a garden, as if she could connect two different things, she asked, 'Do you know to solve computer problems?'. She didnât know that she is asking a guy who has slogged in a call-center like a night-watchman troubleshooting PC problems! But that necessarily doesnât mean that she would be as dumb as some of those US customers! 'Yes.' 'Then I have a problem with my PC. Will you solve it?' 'Sure.' The stroll came to an abrupt end and she took me to her room where the PC was.From whatever she explained I understood that PC doesnt play audio.Its 5 years old and all along it has been like that with the dumb speakers staring at her and the poor lady has been watching her movies in another sister's room!She had tried calling up the technical support for no avail.They had replied that the essential software is already installed!Then she gave all the CDs that has been supplied with the PC.Here in Paris, she explained that even if you buy a PC, nobody comes to your house to install it or troubleshoot it.She had set the system up herself following the instructions given in the manual.Good job, I thought.After fumbling around for half an hour, I could install the right device driver for her sound card and made it work.She played a Tamil movie DVD and shouted, 'Thank You.Thank You.', on hearing the sound. 'Do you eat pork, beef and things like that?'. I was taken aback a bit. 'No. I am a vegetarian. But I'll take egg too'. Then she took me to a dining room. And gave me cooked carrot, cauliflower, mashed potato and some bread and cheese. She made some coffee too. In the midst she brought some prawn pickle and told me so. 'What is it?!' 'Fish. Vegetarians eat fish. Dont they?' 'Sorry. I donât take it'. 'How come you do you eat these bland things with not much taste?'. I kept mum. I thought curd rice is enough to keep me going.  After conversing a bit she said, 'Am happy to see you.', with absolutely no sign of it in her face. All along, until this statement I was comfortable. But the way she delivered it injected a feeling of uneasiness in me and I wanted to move out of the place as soon as possible. I hate people whose heart and tongue do not express the same. She came until the main road and showed me the way to the nearest metro station. By now I had grown very uncomfortable about her and the place. I walked fast without turning back.  Religion is a dead body. For me, a perfect religion is dynamic. Nobody can come out with frozen rules and regulations for a dynamic entity. Does it sound like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle on the motion of electrons? My religion should be shaped every minute according to the tune of my soul by myself. Only I know how it dances. That is religion with life, for it evolves with me. Once I freeze it and write down stringent rules to be followed, the soul runs away as fast as He can and leaves the dead frozen body in my hands, useful for nothing and which would stink like hell. The stinking body would only attract vultures to it! Vultures do not have the necessary competence to catch their own live prey. They wait for something to be dropped down as useless, to pounce upon. I can see these rapacious vultures in contemporary religious leaders.  Musee Grevin is equivalent to Madame Tussaud's of London, hosting wax statues. The entrance to it had long set of mirrors which faced each other at an angle to produce infinite number of reflections. I realized that the entrance fee was 13 euros and walked back. Not worth it for somebody who converts euros into rupees before spending!  In that area of Fauborg Montmartre, there are ancient shopping complexes. They date back to 1800's! Every shop is unique. There were a lot of cafe restaurants in which much of romance was going on. I thought this is the place where I want to be, for it has life and expression. I felt relieved a bit. There were shops for philately, vintage photographic devices, books from gay sex to history of France, figurines of every character that you can imagine for kids. The place had a Paris touch, which always leaves a pleasant feeling behind. Inside one of those shopping complexes and on Rue de Fauborg Montmartre I spotted a couple of chocolate shops, handmade chocolates. The smell out of those shops made my mouth water! They were so rich.  But still I couldnt quite get out of the bitterness of that mother-house. So I consulted the map and among the few choices I had, chose the farthest one! It was Parc de la Villette. The guide said it hosted a science and technology complex. Thought that the place would be interesting, but not as quite as art or sculpture.  But when I was done for the day, I was equally satisfied! Its personally a healthy sign that science and technology can impress me as much as art! It was a big complex with various centers like Explora which hosted the permanent and temporary science exhibitions, Cite des Enfants which is a children's science village, centers for shows and films, forums and conferences. I chose  to go to 'The Geode', one of the theatres there playing short-movies, which Marc had told me would be good. It was, indeed. The geode is a sphere. And hence the screen of the theatre is a spherical surface, which is the speciality, as we see in planetariums. But the films that are screened seem to be special documentaries. Each film lasts for an hour. I have to choose one among the 5 films; 'L'Inde' Tigre' whose hero is the bengal tiger and which is inspired by Jim Corbett who pioneered the Indian wildlife conservation, 'Adrenaline' which studies sky-diving, 'Station Spatiale' which is the story of the world's first international space station or otherwise an orbiting research lab and the people who built it, 'La legende de l'etalon noir' which is about the friendship between a lonely girl in a desert and a young black stallion, 'SolarMax' which depicts the humankind's struggle to understand the Sun. I could quickly narrow down to the last two.And the phrase 'struggle to understand' which prettily rings along the same line as  my state, decided the film.  They had given me a wireless headphone for hearing English audio instead of French and hence I could decipher and enjoy the film. The film was fantastic. It was written, produced and directed by John Weiley. It explained how our forefathers studied the sunlight to mark the start of the year, about Aristotle's geo-centric universe(I was very happy to see his face), the genius of Copernicus who propounded the heliocentric solar system, Galileo Galilei who built the first ever telescope to view the objects in the sky and confirmed Copernicus's proposition, how he was shown the tools of torture by the then government of his to make him accept that he is speaking nonsense (!).Here I thought that when there's a clash between an intellectual and a society, its always the society which loses the battle in the long run, irrespective of the immediate outcome , even if the individual is killed as is the case of Socrates, for intellectuals are dynamic and society tends to be static and hence falters. The point where dynamism should necessarily succeed the static rule is seen, by commons, as a revolution, which inevitably leads to another higher state and wait for another revolution to take it further above! It takes a genius of a character like Mohandas.K.Gandhi to design and spearhead a revolution without a single drop of blood. India, if not for anything else, can be proud for having produced this prodigal son who claims to have experimented with truth when I am struggling to discern it.  Art is waiting for another Picasso and science is waiting for another Einstein. This is how we climb the staircase of civilisation.  The two shows in planetariums, which I had seen in India, stopped with Galileo, as if he is the most recent and modern astronomer.But the film came far ahead.It went on to explain about the sun's dark spots, study of sun's composition through spectrography which was very neatly and  succintly put as based on the property of elements to absorb a unique wavelength of light to leave a unique signature in the spectrum, the way kids could easily understand, Berkelin's theory that sun spews out energy symmetrically through both of its poles and how humanity has to wait until man's first space voyage to confirm this hypothesis through videographing sun spewing out its corona, how earth is protected from sun's flares by its magnetosphere, how a couple of thousands of satellites placed around earth influence our daily life, how SOHO was built and placed a million miles from earth balancing exactly the forces of gravity due to earth and the sun to capture the sun's activity directly, how it was troubleshooted by the international NASA team for a silly mistake of their own which turned the system dead, where do we draw the frontier of science and technology now, role of the various observatories all over the world, how they form a chain to study the sun. A notice at the start of the film said that none of the images of the sun were created by computer animation, but were original images captured by various observatories around the world. I was very much satisfied with the film and its content and the way it was presented keeping in mind the level of knowledge of its audience. Brilliant.  I badly wanted something to drink and for the first time in Paris, I bought something to drink, a cup of Expresso Cafe and settled on a chair there.  The children I see here are pretty cute, with their rosy skin, blonde hair, tender lips, chubby jackets, faltering gait, questioning innocent deep stares. All over the world, children are the same. I feel like kissing these children on their cheeks and hugging them and playing with them and answering to their questions with utmost sincerity and successfully pass over atleast a part of my chaos to them! I want to grab all these nascent minds and make them grow as intellectuals. I was very angry then with the kind of range and method of education that the schools which I studied were able to deliver, when I wanted to learn something in my tender age and as good as now, when I was completely ignorant of my goals. I was very upset so much so that I wanted to build a school and create revolutionary concepts in imparting knowledge and which spews out nobel laureates! I would take pieces of coal as students and turn them into diamonds of immense value through the infinite energy of knowledge, by inspiring their elements to point towards one direction. I'll cultivate intelligence and harvest knowledge in the lands called their minds. I would make sure that these lands remain fertile by giving them enough nourishment from outside. I would deploy the best minds in this world to impart them the education. My school will have all the subjects ever touched upon by humanity and invent many more. Geniuses in art, sculpture, philosophy, literature, science, engineering, sports, music will be created. A student would pass out as a complete human being and a powerhouse of knowledge in his chosen field of study. The necessary and sufficient qualification for getting into my school would be the will to learn, the hunger for knowledge. And the necessary qualification to sustain oneself there, would not be the fee, but the love of his job. The system would be such that it would automatically eject out the incompetent or uninterested. Along the course of education from kindergarten to a doctorate every step, the tenure of it, the speed of it, the style of it, its composition, its breadth and depth, will be decided by the individual himself. There will be no admission based on age, race, religion, caste, previous field of study or any other bullshit. All  I needed were proper motivation and inspiration. I didnât find one worthy blackguard who could deliver these. I'll create my own Men. I have never felt at home when I was in school or college. My children who study in my school will feel completely at home, with tremendous deal of motivation and inspiration around. This will come from the kind of teachers I have deployed and they'll be envied all over the world for the kind of pay that they would receive from me. I'll make these teachers, the gods of knowledge, as a bunch of richest men in the world. My eyes were hot with anger and as if to cool themselves they oozed out tears and they ran down to cool my face too! Its a shame on me that, for the first time, I cried in public. I said to myself, 'Get up. Donât cry in public again. And donât dream in public again.' I immediately mopped my tears and put the coffee cup in the dustbin and walked out of the place to the room. For the day, I canât suffer anymore.  Since I am not yet 25 years old, I could visit almost all the places with 'reduit tarif'! This has saved me some euros. I had to give only 4.10 euros as against the usual rate of 6.10  to visit the Conciergerie.  The conciergerie is called so, for it was the office and residence of 'the concierge'( the keeper ) of the King, who was vested with lots of power. The entrance was a huge hall complete with Gothic archs. It looked royal. It has been originally constructed as an office but later many cells were added which made it the bloodiest prison in the history of France. After the great revolution in 1792, the accused who were thousands in number including personalities from all walks of life from peasants to emperors have been guillotined here. The prisoners faced only two options once they were brought in: freedom or death. Still I could smell the suffering of those hearts there, for the authorities have managed to keep the ambience intact and replay those events through documentaries and pictures well.  I could not even imagine the kind of suffering of the people who were sentenced to death would have gone through. If natural death disturbs me so much, how much these people on whom death has been imposed by heartless savages could have got disturbed? I wondered. It should have been a deadly agony for I read that some of them committed suicide with raw tools that they managed to procure there. The paintings there depicted the feelings who were guillotined en-masse in Place de la Revolution which is now the Place de la Concorde. Very somber. Man's intelligence is so paltry that nobody can ever manage to create a soul. I do not know who has any moral prerogative to put an end to one. No individual or government is qualified to bring an end to somebody's life, not even their own. Its the nadir of justice and the zenith of evil to award a judgement to a fellow human being as to end his life. Its not fair by any moral or ethical standards.  I came out with a heavy heart from that erstwhile prison.  Outside it was raining heavily and the weekend was marred by a pretty bad weather for sightseeing.So I returned to my room and continued my dreaming!  With her long lithe legs,  the lustful shape of the seat of her pants, the fatal curves of her pelvic girdle exposed neatly by her tight jeans, slender sleek waist, voluptuous bump of her bosom drawn by her skin-tight tops, shining shoulders, slender rosy fingers, svelte lines of her face, cherry red seductive lips, the lovely pink skinny cheeks, the wavy upperlip with its minute pale-brown hairs, the tip of the nose which has been made red by the blood rushing to rescue her white glowing skin against the chill wind which splits itself at that point notwithstanding the fast gait of hers, soft thick pink earlobes, the blue eyes which pierce into mine, the look of disdain as if she descends from heaven and I have dug myself up from the netherworld, the flaring forehead, the golden blonde hair which cascades down on her shoulders, the young french girl looks like an angel and disturbs me a lot. I've enjoyed seeing these features in the same fashion described atleast a few hundred times and I donât think I'll ever get bored of it! The chill weather increases the need for warmth!  I saw the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life a couple of weeks ago. Her features had a deadly perfection. She was taller than me. She had the kind of face I would love to see every night. Being so close to me physically in a metro, her face told me that she is still unsullied. I couldnât take my eyes off her blue ones till she disappeared from  my purview. Phew! It pained. I have not heard of a bachelor king. So my queen should be skulking somewhere out there. I should find her out. But how?!  Lets see! Lets Hope!  N.

So I was watching 'The Transporter' today..and the main actRESS, is Shu Qi, a Taiwanese girl. Sometimes she's a TERRIBLE actress, and she can't speak english very well, (obviously, with her accent and everything), yet she stars in many english movies. and chinese movies..but her main language is taiwanese.duH..so when she speaks cantonese..it sounds funnie. I believe that the only reason why she IS in the movie business is because of her looks...   urlLink       ...why is she so PRETTY? I wish I could be as pretty as her=(

DON'T JUST BUY ONE BANANA!! THAT'S STUPID!!you don't have to get exactly 12 chris!!'jO   Forth stop: Home Depot  .   'first grocery shopping then shopping at home depot...chris..what are we doinG?!'-jO so we found everything we needed at home depot...just one last thing..we need cable wire..well we found the cable wire..and you know how whenever you're at home depot, and when you need something, there's like, NO ONE THERE? but when you don't need anything, THEY WON'T STOP BUGGING YOU?? YEAH!! that happened. we needed to get cable wire cut..but there was no cutters. so we needed to find someone to cut the wire for us.  'where the hell is everybody when you need 'em?'-jO  so we ran around the store lookin for someone to cut the wire...we found this guy..  'excuse me, i need to get some cable wire cut.'-chris  'table wire cut?'-crazy old man  'no... cable  wire'-chris  'table wire?!'-crazy old man  'no!! CABLE WIRE!!'-chris  hahahahhahahahahha.........what a crazy old man. then he said he was going to go page someone for us..cuz he ca'nt help us..cuz that's not his work area...*coughcoughbullshitcoughcough* well if certain ppl have their work areas, then where the hell is everyone in the work area where we need someone?! so we wait...for another 10min. no one came..  'look there's another dude, ask him!'-jO  'excuse me, we need some cable wire cut.'-chris  'uh, yeah wait there, and i'll get someone to come'-some dude called marcus  no one came.  'forget it let's just leave'-chris  'oh no, they're gunna get a piece of me..i wanna yell at them!! go up to customer service and tell them that you've been waiting for 30 MIN TRYING TO GET SOME DAMN CABLE WIRE CUT, AND AFTER 2 PPL SAID THEY'D PAGE SOMEONE TO COME, NO ONE CAME!!'-jO  and of course chris, being quite passive..says...'i'll come tomorrow'  well if it was up to me,, i'd yell lol. but it wasn't. we wasted 30min in homedepot, for NOTHING     Fifth Stop: walmart  we need     apple sauce     we went all the way to walmart..........to get apple sauce. why? cuz his parents phoned him and added it to the list of things he need to get. by the time that was all over..it was 5:30pm. i got dropped off home, and chris went to pick up his mom at the GO, at 5:30. the good thing is..i came home just in time, before my dad got home..hehe, he came home at 5:40pm. perfect timing=D      &nbsp;
what a long night..........actually it felt kinda short..it just flew by!! i swear..it was 12am one moment, and the next, it was 8am!! all and the while..i was talking to my BaBy forever..BIGGEST RISK EVER!! I SWEAR I WAS LITERALLY HAVING A HEART ATTACK! I WAS SO SCARED. seee, what happened was that i was online till around 11:45pm, and then got told to go to sleep, so, i went upstairs, and laid on my bed and closed my eyes, and almost fell asleep, but i had a little light on in my room..and i heard someone coming in my room, and i thought it was my mom, so i quickly shut the light off, but it turned out, it was my brother...  'yo Joanna, your 'friend' is online'  'whaaaaaaaaaaat? right now?!'  'yeah, you wanna talk to him?'  this is the moment, jO jumps outta bed, out of her room, and runs downstairs to the basement where her brother sleeps. (good thing my dad was already in bed, and my mom was like brushing her teeth or something int he bathroom, they didn' thear me go downstairs) so i get down there (my brother has his own laptop) and started talking to Chris....then we came up with a plan you seee..to stay up all night together talking on msn...the latest we ever stayed up on there was 4am. so what i had to do was hide in my brother's room UNDER HIS DESK, in the dark, so if my mom came into his room, she wouldn't see me. cuz they already think i'm in my room sleeping.  we spent the whole night talking...not closing our eyes, cuz we shut them...they won't open again!! lol. and our hearts would beat so fast, cuz we're so scared for ourselves and each other. if we got caught...we're done for. =S so we spent the whole night talking, and i went back upstairs, at 8am, to my bed..very quietly so no one could hear me..and fell into my bed...and slept..for a total of about 4 hours..i'm going back to bed soon i assure you. hehe. it was SO worth it. nearing the middle of the night i was like talking drunkness...but by the time sunrise hit,...i was so hyper..    'i've never seen this side of you before.' -chris  'you've beenwith me 15months, and you've never seen this side of me?! it's gotta be the tiredness, lol'-jO    seee chris, i've told you before...life's all about risks...!! if you ain't going to take risks...don't expect anything to happen. we practically risked our lives. !! lol, the way our parents are..yeah.i would say so. huh, funnie thing actually..we kinda got to know each other even better...despite the 15months...we even got to know how we are without sleep, at 4-8 am..in the morning. haha. i'm going to remember this memory for sure,       'my g/f is giving me girl tips'  NEVER ASK A GIRL HER SIZE  you're buying me CLOTHES!? LOL.  making dreams together then making them come true  PATTERNS!!  past g/f's and b/f's  completely ObLiVIOus  innie/inbetweenies  where's the whipped cream!?   that's all i can remember right now with the lack of sleep..some reason..it all felt like a dream..like it didn't even happen..like the times when you came over..they still feel like dreams too..  i was saving the convo, since i was on my brother's laptop, and put it on word..but at the last couple of minutes..i closed the window b4 i saved..cuz i was too concentrated in planning to how i'm going to get upstairs, and listening for my dad walking around....sorry chris=( oh well. we were talking randomness anyways. lol, the BEST randomness. key thing: at least we didn' tget caught...     'i&nbsp;leave when my dad opens the basement door to come down and go to the bathroom...he opens the door to freedom for me! LOL.'    *i need sleep*  &nbsp; urlLink

*sigh..ok..let me start this off by this morning..woke up..already a bad day. lol.i was so tired. i wanted to go back to bed..but i couldn't cuz i have summer school. so i get dressed and every thing and go downstairs. every morning b4 i go to school , i fill up one of my water bottles, (you know me and water). so i go and pour water in my bottle..well..while i was pouring this water...i'm guessing i spaced out..cuz i was pouring it..and i was being stupid..cuz i had to stop pouring when it got near the top..but i didn't..i just like ...WATCHED it spill over..yeah...how stupid am i? lol, so i spilled water all over the floor. i went to get the mop, and mopped it up..and then i went to pour some water out into the sink..well..i didn't see this bowl right..that was in the sink..and it was full of water..and i poured my water straight into that bowl and the water splashed up..INTO MY EYE...AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, MY EYE!! IT'S BURNING!!! lol..i was like..WHAT THE HELL/. lol...great..now my eye is like full of dirty water. lol, it didn't effect me that much, i ran to the bathroom to wipe my eye up..ewewew...ok, then after i was like..i should pack something to eat at school, cuz obviously i am a human being and i need to eat, and i get hungry..well guess what?? THERE WAS NO BREAD AND NO BAGELS! what is going on here?!?! lol. so i get angry..and thought, i'll just eat breakfast, and not pack anything..so i grab a bowl..and take some cereal..as i was pouring the cereal..IT DROPPED ALL OVER THE FLOOR!! well like..it kinda bounced out of my bowl onto the floor..since when does cereal BOUNCE?! well today..it did..so i finally ate my cereal and went to school (all this happened in less than 30min) crazy..so i go to school..and we had..hmmmm. 2 FIRE ALARMS..what is with this school and fire alarms!? and one of them was right in the middle of a quiz..and the other ..right b4 i suppposed to do my test...so the test got cancelleld..cuz we would've had to write it in like and hour..which is UNLIKELY..and all through the day..i was happy cuz i couldn't wait till the end of the day where i go home..and at 4 or so my baby will come over and see me..hmmm..when i got home tho..i realized..my brother wasn't home..'where's stanley, mom?' *jO reads a note dad left for mom* 'what's this?? it says..something..uh..' *it was in chinese. lol* 'umm..it says, me and stanley went to peterbrough something for..carsen?' (carsen is the company my dad works at) uh..wait..'if stanely's with dad..doesn't he have to go to work today at like 4?' mom says, 'yes he does' jo says 'then ...doesn't that mean..dad's going to be home because he's driving stan home? is he goign back to work afterwards?!' *mom phones dad to find out what's going on* 'no, your dads coming home right now..' *time..3:00pm* hahahhahaha...WOW. then i had a heartattack, cuz if my dad's home..and he comes..i'm in BIG TROUBLE. so i went up stairs..sat in my room, did 'homework' while STARING outside of my bedroom window, to watch for him just incase he came. and then i saw him ride by at like..4:15? hehe..awwwwwwwwww, he had his adidas hat on..and i think he was with his dad..on a bike ride..awwwwwwwwwwwwww, it's a father/son thing. THANKGOD for that, lol. but after at like 4:30, i was THEN homealone. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr..stupid plans screwed up on me..but i can guarenteee..they won't screw up tomorrow..and i hope i have better luck. bad day...veryvery bad day..
oH yeah..and i almost got my BIKE STOLEN TODAY. seee, i was going to Simon's house right, and i was ringing the doorbell, and you know simon, never answering the door, because he can't 'hear it' from the basement...so was standing outside for like 5 min. ringing that doorbell, and suddenly this guy rides past on the other side of the sidewalk, and looks my way, then shouts behind him, 'don't do it'...hmmm..sounds kinda fishy to meeee, so i walk back to my back..and there's this girl on the driveway..tiptoeing to my bike,, and was about to pick it up, and i stood there, looking at her..like 'what the fuck do you think your doing?'..and she lloked up at me..and right at that moment i know what she was thinking..'shit..' lol..so all she did was like laugh..cuz there was nothing she could say..and she went back to her bike..picked it up..and rode off..well at this time..simon FINALLY came out..and yeah..it all went from there..interesting eh?? now simon's scared that he can' tleave his bike out on his driveway..fear of getting it stolen. haha. 'this is bad neighbourhood now...='( now i can't leave my bike out!!' hmmm, reason ithink she wanted to steal my bike was because her's didn't have a seat on it..lol. i noticed that much. plus, i knew who she was ..she goes to pickering, and she was in my business class in grade 10...you know chris? the one who asked for a pencil near the end of the school year out of nowhere when we were at our locker? yeah, THAT girl.
...and i'll never see it again...never wear it again...i miss it already..*sniff* i want it back...so white..so red..so black..so...adidas..so new..so STYLIN' IN IT. i look better in it than YOU DO!! ...ok, maybe i don't.  so anyways...ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, i had two quizzes today, and i have another one tomorrow, PLUS a test!!! and now that the temperatures are going up...+ concentration..= HeaDachE. Meee take tylonol *sigh* i miss my ToAsTeR...how it makes toast..how it makes my slices of bread all nice and golden brown..how it makes it all crunchy when you bite into it. lol..oh and peanut butter and jam together..so simple yet so good. yeah...ToAsTeR..my ToAsTeR...simple...yet so good. Now i'm hungry for some ToAsT=)
hmmmmm, so...now i can't go out because i'm a GIRL?! and my brother goes out like every single day. they don't even know where he is right now, and they don't even have a problem with that! i haven't gone out since forever, and if i had asked to go out today, they would've went PSYCHO ON ME. 'Girl's aren't supposed to go out' WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN!? so what do i do? i stay home. what do i do at home? 'clean the house, wash the dishes, vaccuum the house, dust the house, fold the laundry, do the laundry...' why don't i just do EVERYTHING, while my brother is out god knows where, and while my sister stays in her room and goes on her laptop 24/7, and does absolutely nothing?? now you know...now you know why, i go out, when they're not home..

I had a good appointment with K this past week.  We had missed a week because she was gone, so I was sort of feeling like there was so much to cover and not knowing where to start.  Ended up with us talking about Panther (not a suprise...) and me for most of the time.  Interesting thing happened...  As we were talking about us, and what I get from the relationship that is positive and what the lessons are to be learned, my necklace that I wear all the time just slipped off.              Came unlatched and just slid off.       I caught it and made the comment that that was odd (and heres why I love K), she then started asking me what the necklace ment to me...           and how important it might be that it came unhooked right then in the point of the conversation we were having which was basically about my frustration with Panther...        I told her the necklace is something I have worn for years in different ways.  I change out the items all the time, but am always wearing something.  and 99% of the reason I wear it is because of Panther...I wear either something he gave me, or something that has pertinent meaning to him and I on it pretty much all the time.        Right now I have 3 things on it   a Faery that he gave me    a Konji charm of Faith that we bought in DC    an amethyst crystal that is just mine...        She then lead me through discussing what it might mean that it fell off...and what we came up with was that while it fell off, and that would to the outside world seem like it was 'broken' in reality I could tell it was not (the clasp was still intact) and because I was aware of the fact it slipped off I was able to catch it and put it back on rather then ignoring it and losing it, or assuming it was broken and throwing it away.        This lead to the idea that with Panther and I, that while from the outside perspective it seems 'broken',  from my innerself I see that it is **really fine** and that as long as I pay attention to that fact and dont ignore things and let them fall and be lost, it can be put 'back on'.        Onward now to the lessons I feel I need to learn within this relationship.  I came up with 2 possibilities, which actually leads to one... Let me see if I can sum them up.  Well the one possibility that I have pretty much thrown out and I'll explain why in a minute, is the idea that I am to learn to not be naive and to learn to walk away... the other lesson (which is the harder of the two possibilities) is that I am to learn patience and trust.  Trust in my innerself more then anything.  To trust the inner voice that tells me to keep holding on, and that it is all worth it, while the outer voice is going 'dont be a smuck, just let go and walk away...it'll hurt less now then if it happens later'...see that is where the conflict comes in to play.        The idea of the lesson being to walk away is really the 'easier' of the two...and it really is just the complex expressing itself...the no trust, fear of getting hurt complex...its not really a lesson now is it.        Now the other one, the trust in me, the listen to my inner self one, that one is the hard lesson and the more difficult because it means going AGAINST all my inner defenses that have built up because of the complex that is trying to fool me into thinking its a lesson to be learned.  Sooooo, basically we came to the conculsion that as frustrating as things are right now for me, I really do want to give Matt and I more time and I dont want to turn my back and protect myself.  I need to learn patience, self relience and trust, while at the same time learning to speak up for myself.       ***I cant pick easy lessons now can I?******      We also discussed how this relationship Panther and I have really in all its oddity has some good sides.  The fact that I am 'alone' so much makes it where I am               1) forced to be dependent on myself, therfore stronger then I would be if I was in a traditional relationship where I could dump things on someone elses shoulders and              2) gives me alot of time to do this work, move forward on this journey I have started.  I have no conflicts of someone tugging me away from my inner work and that is partly why I am able to do so much and move forward so quickly.        Also, my doing this work, and shoring myself up, makes me a stronger person to be there for Panther as he starts his own work and really needs my dependability and not my flakyness...

Staunch, religious-conservative Republicans are just as much the problem as annoying, pussy liberals. Republicans are no longer the party devoted to freedom.  They're mainly a religious party, who governs us based on their religious philosiphies. Even besides religion, they no longer believe in gun rights, and they made the 'Patriot' Act. They claim they're for 'small government' but it's quite the opposite. But back to religion, it's annoying to have some radical Christian government tell the country that 'sex is bad' and so forth- John Ashcroft is like, the epitome of the religious, authoritarian Conservative. Ashcroft has spearheaded a huge anti-porn campaign, and has supported way tighter FCC regulations. Both things that majorly piss me off. This whole Christian Crusade against abortion, sex, porn, drugs, YOU NAME IT... DOES NOT belong in our national policy. I've had enough of these annoying fundamentalists imposing their will on me. Hey, you church organizations and lobby groups- preach to your own people whatever whe hell you want- But keep it outta my government.
It really sucks to be both an outdoors enthusiast and an out-of shape fatass at the same time. But, Lyle Canyon is an very easy trail (or at least the first part before the pass) and it should go relatively smoothly. We're (my parents and I) just going to hike a few miles in, stay at a nice campsite a couple nights, and hike back.   To accompany me in this new trip is a new backpack, the Osprey Aether 75- a sweet pack that totally redefines the word 'ergonomic'. Also, I finally get my own single-person tent (not the $250 tactical one I wanted from TADgear), which means I can finally sleep alone and uncramped, and have a little privacy to myself.
Hello? Hel...Hello? Is this thing on?  Hi, I'm Henry. I live in a smallish town of 25,000 on the central coast of Kalifornistan, that combines the problems of a city and the problems of a rural farm-town all into one horrible, crappy package . I like guns, knives, and other deadly weapons in general. Enjoy my future posts in this (we)blog.
I am not very much religious at all- I am definitely not a member of an organized religion-I'm not really sure what I am. I don't know what I believe, or anything. Basically, in my opinion, religion is basically the quest for knowledge about what follows after death, and how to make life after death pleasant. There is more to it, but basically, that's all it boils down to. My problem with Christianity, Judiasm, and Islam is it's hard to believe that we only have one life to prove ourselves, and when we die, we are immediately sentenced to a wonderful bed of clouds where everything is perfect or a firey dungeon of pain for eternity. I just can't help but think there's much more to it than that. I do not consider myself an aethist, however, as I can't look at this vast universe and feel that there is nothing behind it. There must be a force or being behind this, life must have a meaning. I, and no person on this planet, for that matter, can know what ensues death. Perhaps we are reincarnated, perhaps we become another human being, perhaps something else happens. But I can not bring myself to believe that whether or not I swear too much, if I have sex before marriage or not, and whether I commit some other 'sin' as defined by the church will decide my life for eternity. What do I think is 'wrong'? I try to live my life on the basic principle that it is wrong harm someone or their property without good cause, and it is wrong to steal. I try to be kind to others, I try to be as peaceful and friendly as I can. I believe that if there is a God watching over us all, that is all he could want, is a loving soceity. I have trouble with the organized religions, as they promote the idea of God as being 'love', but also preach about the 'firey wrath and vengence' that he will strike down on us if we lead 'sinful' lives. If there is a God as we know him, I truly believe that he does represent, or is love. If he is a vengeful tyrant, then well, it's a pretty dreary existence we have here. It's hard to think of what awaits us after our passing, but I believe, with all my heart, that it is not dull and dismal as some people would like me to believe. If there is a God, why would he focus on suppressing our natural instincts as human beings, especially if he created us this way, instead of simply promoting the idea of love, and unity between us all?   -Henry    'Sin lies only in hurting others unnecessarily. All other 'sins' are invented nonsense.' -Robert A. Heinlein
I realize in my postings I've been a bit, err... high-strung. See, In reality, I'm not much like that, but I like trying to be different and offensive, to make a statement. I do not believe in political correctness, and I try to go in the exact opposite direction of it, as a way of fighting back. So, if you see me making some heated rant about something absolutely ridiculous, or you see one too many 'fuck's on this blog, just keep that in mind. Sorry if I offend anyone, but noone's forcing you to read this. And frankly, if you have a serious objection to 'dirty words', I just can't really understand. I'm sorry, but in my view, they're just words, that I use to express my opinion. I am not offended by these words, I have no objection to using them. Again, I'm sorry if I'm offensive, but that's just the way things are, please keep the above in mind.  Thanks, Henry
I'm back after all of this vacation and parents-taking-the-computer crap. I'm dog-ass tired now, but I'll get back to here.
Somedays they amaze me. How grown up they are My keepers and I theirs Once so little and helpless Now blooming into their own What would I do if I didn't have them... Where would I be ... Life would not be the same. My heart burns for them,  with love and worry Wanting them to be safe and happy Never wanting to let go. They are mine forever..  One thing I will always have.. Is their love.Forever.
In my mind , thoughts wonder in and out of reality Aimlessly floating , causing grief, confusion and pain In my mind memories haunt me. Torturing scenes from my childhood into adulthood Every choice and decision made, taunting me relentlessly In my mind, I talk to myself, asking rebounding questions  Never satisfied with the answer In my mind is a constant battle with myself Do this, you should of done that... why didn't you.... A never winning scenario.... In my mind is a mind of many and mind lost to itself.
Another day gone by... started out shitty and didn't get much better. I should just go to bed and stay there... my safe haven... sleep , pillow and blanket.   Ah... to sleep is to escape.  In the night, my soul wonders free To search out the new and forget about the past In the night, my heart is free to feel  To open up and engulf all the wonders of the world In the night, my mind escapes and journeys to far off places Experiencing all and everything, without guilt or shame In the night, my body is at rest  Self healing, young and beautiful..full of grace. Ah ... to sleep and never wake.  One day , One day.
Well here we go.. My mind is full and ready to burst. Let's just say I'm having one of those days where I wonder if I've made the right choices in my life, my once marriage, divorce (the choices that went along with it) AND EVERYTHING SINCE THEN. My life has been a whirlwind... for everything that has happened it's all be a choice , a reaction or done in defense. At 35, a mother of 3 kids, ( 13, 11 & 10 ) in a serious relationship ( I think ) and still feeling the weight of past relationships. I guess I carry things to close to heart and ALWAYS over analize. Why do we do the things that we do?? Creatures of nature they say... or just scared and grasping, I say. Afraid of being alone and afriad of making the tough choices. Do we always opt for the easy way out? I really wonder sometimes. Nothing is ever easy in life.... it hasn't been for me. If I wanted a scape goat I could blame my upbringing... but I don't and won't. I survived and think  ..THINK I came out of it ok. I guess reflection is a self cleansing thing...  I guess. I wonder if I'm steering my childern in the right direction...I see my self and the choices I made in them all the time. I sit here , with a banging headache, sore from working out and feeling very empty at the moment. So needy I can be , wanting to be loved and wanting attention,but then to be left alone to do my thing... what ever that is. Screwed in the head maybe... or is this normal you tell me.........Please.
Sitting in the dark with only my computer keeping me company.  Music to soothe my soul , making the time fly by I take a deep breath trying to clear my mind... What lies a head of me is endless..Every day is the same  What a routine we live in Cooking , cleaning trying to keep everyone happy Oh what we moms do for love Waiting for the thank yous and the hugs  Smiles and kisses keep us going It's the little things that count... We rant and rave sometimes.. trying to be heard. Mostly out of frustration. Tired are we that run the house. Feeling unappreciated and part of the furniture What a grand life we lead.
Lost in a sea of ever changing emotion the dark sky looming in my fear of loneliness all but drowned by mistrust and no devotion swept away by the bleeding heart , crushed and broken What's to save me...  An Island of warmth and security? a lovers arm wrapped around me? Those would be ideal, but lost I am  Until the sun breaks through once again  And the passion of it's Love frees me.
Tornado events take my energy away A rollercoaster of never ending Thrills & Chills. To maintian is the goal and not to lose control Even when face to face with a hater who's so fake Being the better person and not to give in Or atleast know when to shut my mouth , making it all end Not take it personally when being ignored I'm standing my ground I will not go through that door Rationalizing their problem , only to make myself feel better Can you see me, can you hear me... I am right beside you I am not a ghost , I do exsist ...can you not see my clinched fist? Should I yell or scream..or should I cry Your power struggle will leave you behind. Open your eyes.. are you so blind?
Lost in the sound of haunting music Dream like visions past me by The rythmn is hynotic My eyes close and I lose myself Swaying to the music My body eludes me Swimming in the lyrics I become one with the song Beating is my heart  Keeping time , pounding out of my chest. I can't breathe.. I'm victim to the tempo Swirling and twirling endlessly Darkness takes me.. the song is over.
I want to write .. but I am so tired. I have many thoughts to jot down. Feelings , emotions.... but again never enough hours in the day... tomorrow , tomorrow and tomorrow.... Until then, May dark wings embrace you and give you the kiss of life.

Word's of true wisdom ( see previous entry ) Feeling like shit lately.. the only time I feel good is when we're playing racquet ball and I can sweat every bad thing out of my body. Work is stressful and tense.. Another big change and people scared for their jobs. Me? Yes and no.. I don't wna to lose my job , but if I have no choice and I get laid off... well then I guess I make the best of it. I am excited to go back to Heritage. It's likre going home.. closer to my kids and my old stompin' grounds. The weather sucks too.. finally a weekend with no plans. maybe some nice quiet time at home with my love. Maybe take in a movie. That would be nice.. Financial stress had been getting the best of us.. with the bi-weekly pay  now in full swing, making sure our bills our paid, food in the freezer and gas and his support paid.... there is nothing left. I think we are finally getting the hang of it. Vacation is soon .. 4 weeks... I can't wait. Sun , sand and Shane & I. Who knows what  we'll be coming home too... work wise that is.. The BIG move is July , the first or second week. Who knows who will be moving and who won't...... Too many changes. To find something else.. may be a task all in itself. Pay cut comes to mind.. starting over.... Not a good idea. Maybe I'll just hang out and see what happens. I've had 2 nights with out all kinds of extra running... the kids schedules are wearing me down. I love watching them play ball... Proud momma for sure.  A true balance is the goal of my happiness.... how to get there is the question at hand.   Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity  To seize everything you ever wantedOne moment  Would you capture it or just let it slip?   Good question..........................till we meet again. May the dark wings embrace you and give you the security of it's love.

Mindi's Sun Sign is Pisces ...          Romantic Pisces, you are the twelfth and last sign of the zodiac. You are regarded as the sign of sensitivity and receptivity, and are a true chameleon by being mutable and infinitely complex. Your keywords are communion and vision, and you have the capacity to go beyond this world to the one of dreams and the spirit.  Your ruler Neptune, the planet of confusion and chaos, gets people out of habits that imprison them so that they question themselves and can discover another path toward growth and spirituality. Neptune is also the planet of imagination and illusion, and governs the dream world with all its many facets.  Pisces is the third of the three water signs, Mindi, which means that you are concerned with the realm of emotion and feeling. You deal with sensitivity, intuition, and deeper psychic aspects of life. You are able to conduct unconscious telepathic communication with others.  Your sign rules the twelfth house of the chart, the sector associated with the unconscious, need for seclusion, and places of restriction. This house describes the wellspring of your being, including psychological problems that you repress. This house is very healing and can promote personal and spiritual growth, once you make the effort to go deeper and face YOUR reality.  Pisces is a mutable sign. You adapt to the exigencies of life and ingeniously melt into circumstances like a chameleon. In your interaction with others, you are personable and compassionate, and successfully connect on a deep emotional level.  Your strengths, Mindi, lie in your altruistic and empathetic nature, because you feel the urge to help people less fortunate than you. Your sensitivity and intuition make you a true healer. Your strong imagination and highly evolved creativity predispose you to artistic expression.  Your main weaknesses are that you can be weak-willed, passive, and indecisive. Many times, you prefer to escape reality and indulge in your dreamworld. Chaos and confusion can be present in you, which may frustrate your circle of friends. At the same time, you can be oversensitive and fragile, feeling victimized by others.                   Your Rising Sign is Aries ...         As an Aries Rising, Mindi, you face the world with intense energy and primal power. You always look to go beyond your own limits and outdo yourself with every step. With each challenge, you learn more about yourself, and gain additional confidence to go even farther on your next adventure. Your incredible decisiveness enables you to act on your ideas the minute you form them. You don't have time to waste! You are very competitive and have a strong urge to excel in whatever you do, and you continually prove your power through action.  The downside is that you can be quite impulsive, Mindi, and often make decisions too hastily for your own good. Once you've made a decision, it's difficult for you to go back and reconsider, because you only know how to move in one direction in life, and that is straight ahead.  It's no easy task to make someone like you back down. This irreversible strength you have inside allows you to thrive in some of the most powerful and influential positions in the business world, the ones in which the important decisions are made. If you have stopped climbing, it's probably because you've already reached the top. It's as simple as that!  Since you are extremely ambitious and outgoing, Mindi, you don't quail at social climbing in order to make your dreams come true. Once in a while, you may even inadvertently step on some people who get in your way, as the ideal you quest for can blind you to the effect of your actions on others. However, Mindi, you don't hesitate to recognize and reward those people who have helped you on your way up, because you are an honest and fair player.
What kind of kiss are you?     You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming. Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.

Back from vaction.. it was well earned and very needed. Now back to reality and everything that goes with it!!! Work totally sucks and I dread the thought of being there. There is no human factor there any more. We are all $ signs and treated like it. Beat it till it bleeds and dies is how the employees there are treated.. used and abused... Oh but hang in there they say.. next year will be rewarding and you might even get a raise!! KISS MY ASS I SAY!! Letting go people who have given everything to the company and to their co-workers. You have no safety line here. Keep the bastards and the whiners.. let all the true bright stars go... makes no sense to me. Not my problem my netter half says.. don't worry about it!! How can I not??? I care about what I do and how it's done....working in chaos kills me!!! I'd give anything to not go back...BUT I have to... I guess I'll put on the fake smile and do my best...

-Hurt- I hope you know this is my FAVORITE nine inch nails song. Many people have left your life.. and it seems that every time you are hurt even more.

You are always there waiting for them to come back into your life, and would give them everything you have if they did.. but you know you're just going to disappoint them.    urlLink   What Nine Inch Nails song are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

You are Form 2,  Angel : The Pure.   'And The Angel rose as holy protector for all that was created.  She fought with honor and valor to serve the good of the world.  But the coming of the mankind was her downfall; and end to purity.'   Some examples of the Angel Form are Michael (Christian) and Hercules (Greek). The Angel is associated with the concept of virtue, the number 2, and the element of wind. Her sign is the zenith sun.  As a member of Form 2, you are a person of your word.  You generally keep your promises and give everything you do your best.  Although some people see you as overbearing sometimes, you know that you have to stay true to yourself and do what's right.

a lil bit bored right now. I have to do my reportage :( I actually don't like it, cuz it's election day, which means we should be free from work :( and now, i'm waiting for my boyfriend. he still does some of his jobs :( fortunately, i have this blog. it such a great friend, 'someone' to share. Blog... I love you more than my boyfriend (at least for now. lol)
Well, if there's something I love in this world, that will be my... BOYFRIEND!!! Wow, I love him so much. Eventhough we sometimes get fighting or argue, I will never leave him. I'm truly, madly, deeply in love with him. I think I'm going to marry him soon.
Well, I voted Amien Rais-Siswono in this morning election. Praise be to God, this couple won at 3 TPS in my neighborhood. Hope it will be the good beginning for my country. I've been a huge fan of Amien Rais for long time. So, I wouldn't choose any candidates but him --and his couple of course. Will he win and become president? I don't know. Let's see the result, soon.
yeah... i've just built my own blog! hmpffh.. can't wait to fill it.
David's in England [april told me] and i really miss him.
damn it...April's been meditating for like...forever! and its driving me whacko!!! she never listens or talks to me anymore...i hate it! ugh!! and well, David's made friends with jen. he never leaves his crypt now...well..except for patrols. i never get to come on patrol with them...that so totally sucks... i mean...i could help. April doesnt know this but when i was asigned to polish the weapons and thingys, i kinda...used them..i sneaked out and went on my own patrol. i dusted my first vamp!!!was cool...you know... it turning to dust and all...it was awesome...and the energy i felt was fantastic...power.... i felt ultimate power...
okay...so...somethings really bugging April. she hasnt been telling me anything lately and it sucks. April treats me like a little kid. hello??? im 17! im old enough to go on patrols. plus im a potential slayer...and she could fill me in now and then but she doesnt...freak...the wiccans are always busy meditating and all. i could help with the research. or maybe the slayage. anything to keep me busy...just as long as they dont give me the polishing weapons deal again...
welcome to my new blog.
what is wrong with you, David? now youre telling April you love HER??
David! how could you do that to my sister?? how could you even try!? that is it! that is it David! if you hurt my sister? touch her? i swear, you are going to wake up in flames!
alright...I dont get April. first, she tells David to lay off and then she teleports on over to England and begs him to come back...what is wrong with her? i mean, if you're going to tell someone to lay off, you wait for them to come back. and if they dont, suffer! thats the first rule of dumping. that's it...it's safe to say that my sister has completely lost it! i mean...what is she? numb? David's been there the whole time...and David's all love love love love April! and what does my idiotic sister do? go away David! i need time alone, David! it's just...damn it...what is wrong with her? cant she see what David's done for her? there are so many things that David's done for her. and she just...ugh! alright...nevermind...  later...
I am stressed out!! Worried about a math test that I have to take on Monday, August 23rd. I know I passed the one last semester, but honestly I believe it was all fluke! I know one gets three chances to pass it with an 85%, but I am still nervous. I want to go in and kick butt and be done with it.       Then I just plain out scared to death about this upcoming two semesters. Two classes, two clinical days..blah!! I am already tired and classes don't start till the 30th.       oh well..STRESSED is just DESSERTS spelled backwards. So, a big ole' hot fudge sundae sounds good.      Peace all      Dina
Okay, so I said I was going to write down my thoughts, but I have decided to just let it go. *uhmmmmmmmm* OOH!, what Zen feeling.  I am on my way, shortly, to pay the first installment of this years tuition for my children. It's crazy. I will be paying damn near as much for tutition a month as I do for rent. And I don't really care for this school. So, that, in itself, makes the experience extremely painful. But, for right now it's convenient. Just a couple of blocks north.  I shall have to endure the pain for at least one more year, then we can check into St. Daniel's.  Which is the grammar school Nick attended.   And I really like that, but they did not have a full-time preschool.  St. Rene does.  Answers the question of what I am suppose to do with the kids while in school and at clinicals.   Luckily, I have the world's greatest mother in law, if it wasn't for I wouldn't have made it this far.  She watches my kids, makes sure they get to school and never complains about it.  I think she really, really wants me to suceed and I appreciate all that she has done to allow me the opportunity.  Okie, off to the school.  WISH ME LUCK.  They always seem to have something that you need to buy and forgot to mention at the end of the school year.  YEAH!, like I need another friggin' bill this month.  August is our UGLY month.  But, we will survive, with minimal scaring to show for it all...:P  May the blue bird of happiness visit you today!  Dina
Does anyone know anything about this subject?? Can you iron Velveteen?? For the love of god, someone please let me know! *snicker*  I will post later today. Need to get my thoughts in order and I have been harping on a particular subject for a half an hour. It needs a break. But, I am positive that it will rear it's ugly head again and then you all will get an ear full. So, all I have to say is..BEWARE, the butterfly wrath is coming...to local theatres near you. HA!, now that would be cool. I could be a one woman show. BRING IT BABEE!

YeeHAW!, on saturday morning at the bright and earlier time of 8am, my big toe toenail was removed for .....FOREVER! I am still dealing with my freakiness...:P Actually, it went better then I thought. Well, that could be the Darvocet talking...*la la la* Will see if still holds true next week.  Now, I am trying to figure out what I can wear to a wedding reception we have to attend on Sunday. Barefeet are in season....right?? My hubby says tennis shoes, but the thought of anything putting any pressure on my toe makes me cringe...*CRINGE* See ya told ya. So, I guess I will have to weed through my shoe closet and see what I can wear and then pick my outfit from there. *go me*  I am thinking about posting the pic of my toe. It looks really, really....uhm, RAW!  *snicker* I will decided tomorrow if I will be doing that or not.  Peace my brothers and chickadees!
The hubby and I went to his sister's graduation party.  I had a nice time.  But, it appears my boobs have become quite a topic of discussion..*boggle*  It's like they have taken on their own identity!  I truly believe the girls in the Fam are jealous.  So, me and 'the girls' would like to say this to them...'nah-nah-nah'  Yes, I do indeed have a sensitive bone in my body....:P  Really, I do care about their handicaps...NOT!!!
Frankie, showed me the way to this new little toy.  *hugs Frank*  I hope to be entertaining, that's about all I can promise.   Right now,  I am sitting and debating the very complex world of wardrobe.  It's either striped capris or the army green ones.  Decisions, decisions!!!  Why must life be so hard?!?!  Oh and..I WANT SLIDERS!!!  *enough said on that subject*

The energy of this place makes me crazy, both angry and insane.  All eight of us relocated in the house we grew up in. Eliyahu, Naftali, Tsiona, Ayelet and Aliza, not to mention the babies, Ema and Papa. I don't connect with the person who grew up here, mostly because that person was so disenfranchised. These days I feel quite the franchise, and, hoping somehow to make up for lost time, fail miserably. Getting dressed every morning is an ordeal. Morning coffee and cigarette must be taken locked in old bedroom. Nevertheless, She has calmed down and I'm not Her biggest problem. I have the sense that even She has come around to the humor of her situation. She is endlessly trying to sick her possy of manicurists and masseuses and waxers and make-up artists upon me, and sometimes I comply because then She inspects my eyebrows to make sure they are perfect, and stande very close to me and smiles very brightly if all is well.  Miriam, Anthony, Nadya, you are all on my mind from far away. Noam, Noam. Having lunch with Ari and Cippi, Cippi who married Ari because Naftali wouldn't marry her. They want to sit around and reminisce about old times in which each and every one of us was miserable. Why, oh why, I can't figure it out. Schreibman has called twice...How to avoid seeing these fascists.  Miss you all greatly.
My boss where I waitress told me the most moving story yesterday. Picture this guy, Jay. He's Nigerian, but his mom is American. So his English is very mildly accented, but it's mildly Ebonicsy, and the two seem to overlap most of the time. He wears tasteful jewlery, and shoots the shit with everyone in a comfort-level that suggests ghetto familiarity; but he also keeps a distance more respectful than the more ghetto types. So he talks the talk, but there's something not quite right about his picture.  So I'm in between tables, and I ask him what his last name means, and he says it means 'Let the world rest.' He says his great-great-great etc. grandfather, about 10 generations back, was a warrior, and always the first to volunteer for war, so they would always bless him by saying, 'Let the world rest,' so he wouldn't be in danger. It became like a nickname for him, and then it became his last name. Anyway, this ancestor said that if any of his decendants ever needed anything, they could come and ask him, and he would help, even after he was dead. He was buried with a thick chain wraped around his body, and then he was lowered 69 feet into the ground, and the chain goes all that length, and sticks out of the ground where Mr. Let the world rest lies. Legend has it that if you are his ancestor, and you tug on that chain, he tugs back. 'Does he?' I asked Jay. 'Yes,' he admitted, his voice small. 'When I was a kid, it used to scare me...' Throughout the story, Jay's voice had the tone of one incredulous that he is actually&nbsp;uttering these words. I knew that I was the first person on this side of the rainbow to be hearing this story. It was all pretty unreal.
Friday Night Alexander and Noam met. I, however, was too drunk to pull off anything graceful, and contented myself if not with a job well done, at least with a job not botched. Before the party, Noam and I went out for dinner with A. and N. Noam and I argued politics, me claiming that Israel and Palestine no longer need political intervention, and he arguing that giving back Gaza is a way of not giving back West Bank. Anthony, insecure at the castration of his ever present authority due to his ignorance of political issues, began to chide us for bickering. I looked at him and harshly told him he wasn't helpful, just as&nbsp;Noam, ever in search of a father figure, implored A. to help us. Dinner ended somewhat strained, Noam annoyed at my political views, me annoyed at his caving to A.'s pressure, and A. worried that I was pissed at him.  'Are you angry at me?' he asked when he and N. took us to our car.  'No. I feel to guilty about my harshness to be angry.'  He said it rang true, and we agreed to meet sometime soon.  On the way back Noam and I decided to argue about politics rarely, and to do so respectfully. For example, it hurts him that I argue that Bush and Kerry are so similar because it entails that I don't think Bush is a jackass. I decided to preface any equalizing remarks with remarks about Bush's incompetence as a human being. Etc.   We went to visit Papa at Lake Bruce and sat on a dock and in a kayak. I had this image of my child sitting next to us spalshing its feet off the edge of the dock into the water, and saying to me, 'Look, Ima, my feets are in the water!'   Tomorrow I'm going to Israel, and must remember to call and see everyone. It will take masterful negotiation not to see Aliza Schreibman who I don't mind hurting like that because she broke my heart a year ago in July, and again this year in June. I'm still smarting. I'll send Naftali over to see her.
I have eaten  the plums that were in the icebox  and which you were probably saving  for breakfast  Forgive&nbsp;me they were delicious so sweet  and so cold  A poem&nbsp;by William Carlos Williams. And now, a poem by Batya: 'This is just to say' :  I have stolen  the heart  that was beating in your chest  and which you were probably  saving for a better man  Forgive me it is contagious so sweet and so pure
It's an age of forgotten passions. It's hard to recover that which gives me pleasure when I am in such new space, for example, waiting tables at Leona's and working for Mysterious Mystery Shopping. When&nbsp; you work a 12 hour day, the thought of watching a movie curled up on the couch with a beer and a cigarette trumps the idea of reading ANYTHING. I'm scared.  Please, someone, convince me that there is an actual difference between John Kerry and George Bush...
In corsets, like we do, year after year, day after day.  Oh to be alive. Feeling well, feeling in power. I know that indicates I'm thinking wrong about things, but until I can get my mind around the right way to go about picturing myself, at least I'm happy. I saw this movie yesterday called 'the grass is always greener'. Fantastic.  Also: I love it how the Economist and the Wall Street Journal can say the same thing about the economy, I mean recite the same facts, but convince you of opposite states of affairs at the same time. It really goes along with Donald Davidson's thesis about paradigms and evidence.  Melech Rachaman, Rachem Aleinu. Tov Umeitiv Hidaresh Lanu. Shuva Eleinu Bahamon Rachamecha.
Looking forward to Germany like chemotherapy--you solve one problem at the expense of loosing your hair, intense vomiting, skin boils, etc.  Anyway, I'm still healthy, in case you were worried. Tsiona and Dani, thanks for calling last night. (PS. in America, we sleep at night, you know, from around 1-9 AM, ok?) I've finally come around to accept that this, well, IS my life. I'm not waiting for something exciting to happen, and I'm not expecting things to radically change. I'm just living it. I think that may mean I've given something up. What the hell. My parents and grandmother insist on driving me crazy. Very strange. I've decided that I need to give them as much as I can without expecting them to realize and without expecting any thanks (since nothing is enough).  And so it blows, tiddlibum.
Lieszche and I went to see Princess Diaries 2 yesterday and ate $40 worth of coke and candies and shit, and got hyper-glycemic, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It's early in the morning and it feels like winter is closing in all around, though it's far off. Something about the chill of these mornings is uncanny...
I used to think I'd whore my poetic tapestry to the first taker.  Now I know it's not true. Rather: I now know I'd tax he nude in my bed. No, no, what's the word? Ah,  welcome . I would welcome the nude in my bed, if only it weren't...Thursday.  A poem from 'Hymns for the Drowning' by Nammalvar:  Before I could say,    'He became cowherd        fish         wild boat,' he became a million million.  or, perhaps, a favorite favorite? So which of us is drowning baby?  I had a rare encounter today with a dark and evil thought that rang truly true like a newly acquired familiarity, and now, I am on the rampage.  Furthermore: Alan Keys told the world today that Obama's position on abortion is akin to that of the slave traders--let the people decide, never mind what our moral commitments are. It's an oddly affable argument. I can't seem to stop smiling. If only there were no morality to the other side of things, the argument would actually shtim. As it stands, Keys looks a bit silly. Like the authors of the Talmud--'certainly it is our perogative to decide whose life is worth more, the mother or the baby. After all, we are MEN!'  But, as my Rebbe Miriam says, sarcasm is not an argument. So here's the argument: fuck off. Don't tell me you want to marry me and then leave me a $50 tip when I can't throw it back in  your face because of my credit card debt. Can't you see that the sight of you makes my knees shake, and bile rise in my throat?!? I hate you all.
All the world like a woolen lover once did seem on Henry's side. Then came a departure. Thereafter nothing fell out as it might or ought. I don't see how Henry, pried  open for all the world to see, survived.  Vehamavin Yavin.   Almost back, almost home, or is it. Gay Israelis are the UberMenschen. You get all the burning suffering exciting and engaging conversation of an israeli without the trying to get laid mention the army as much as possible how can I force her into a place she casn't refuse bullshit. It's the perfect combination. They are, well, fabulous. (who would have thought this was the perfect combo waiting to happen.) I told the cook who catered the Sheva Brachot at our house that I am a waitress and he laughed in my face. He absolutely refused to believe me. He lives in Har Homa and called me 'Ati' the way Arab speakers do when they never realize the difference. Funny that. Murad was the same way. I could never bring myself to point it out. I think I'll always be that way. These days bring it up as a joke, but it's more painful that way. When I say I bring it up I mean things that would have shamed me as a fifteen year old and I thus asume are still shameful to my interlocutors. It's like retarded people--get over yourself!!! But Israel is good. Zev, I'll be at Shushan 4 tonight again with Eliyahu and maybe Jose--come join us.
Hey crazy ninos!   I've decided to start one of these bloggy things. God has been teaching me suh much lately...tis a shame not to write it down somewhere. So alas, I turn to the wonderful world of internet. So hopefully I can keep up and remember to write the things in here. I guess we will see how it goes, eh? (that was for all of you Canadians out there....)  Peace.
Weekend Stuffeseses   My modem died so o I haven't been able to type anything on here over the weekend. Darn storms. Well, this weekend was pretty cool. I went to the Riverbats game with a group from Southeast Christian Church. It was the second game I've ever even been to ever. The other one was the Anaheim Angels...well unless you count little league, then I've been to three games total. Anywho, the game got kinda interesting in the last inning and then we lost.   I walked around the stadium alot. It was kinda cool seeing all of the different people. I prayed for alot of them as I walked past. God's really placed that on my heart lately....praying for random people....cuz with God it's never random. All of the people that I have any kind of interaction with whatsoever whether it's as a really good friend or the cashier who always checks me out at the store or the waitress at the restaurant or a person I pass on the street and never say a word to, God has placed them all in my life and in my path for a reason. That's so crazy cool to think about!!! It makes you realize how interactive God is in our lives, whether we realize it or not. It definitely makes me think more about my responsibility as a Christian to pray for these people and, if so led, to start a conversation and possibly some kind of relationship with them. I pray that God would place these people in my path and give me wisdom and courage to take advantage of the opportunities He's given me.  Sunday, I went to church. Woohoo. Kyle Idleman talked about servanthood and how we are called to serve not to be served. And our servanthood is not limited to people who are 'servable' (aka: nice, appreciative, respectable, yadda da yadda). We are also called to serve those who annoy us, are rude and unappreciative. And even if we know that they are going to hurt us in the future, it doesn't matter. This is such a big thing for me. I've been praying that God would truly help me to understand forgiveness as He sees it. I kinda hold to a kind of 'forgiveness' that says 'ok, i will try hard to get along with you despite the fact you've hurt me or ticked me off.' It's such bullcrap on my part. I've got to come to the point of realization that I will be hurt and I will be stepped on and even in those times I've got to step out and serve those people knowing that it will happen again but not allowing that to hinder my service or my thoughts about that person....anywho, it was just a whole lot about what I've been studying in Jeremiah....actually, I think I might just go ahead and describe in another post my current spiritual developments cuz they are suh exciting.   The Vine was really cool. Worship was awesome despite the fact that I thought the floor was going to cave in....but it didn't :O)
Distractions   The need to love. It is a strong and powerful force.  Not just to be loved but to love - to experience the fulfillment.  Relationships falter all around. It's hard to have hope.  Yet the need remains. Our very nature yearns for these things. Yet when I search for the object of my love, I am left wanting.  I wonder how people find each other, where it begins.  Still, the need consumes me.  I pray.  I hear others speak of their need - how it consumes their life.  I pray.  It consumes mine too.  I pray.  The balance between the heavely and earthly is oftern twisted for the earthly I can see.  But the heavenly surrounds me, lives within me. It penetrates my soul, my being.  Yet somehow I'm blinded to it's presence.  I trudge on down the sidewalk - the trees, the car, the people.  My thoughts shift. How can I devote my heart - fully devote - to this God.  A parking meter, a mailbox, a crosswalk.  The God of the universe, the mighty creator.  The gas station, a pothole, the noise.  He calls my name, but I hardly hear.  The traffic, the planes, the songs in my head.  Dear God, scream louder.  **This was written on 10-2-03 as I deal with the vice of allowing the distractions in my life to cloud my view of Jesus.**
Surreal   I find no comfort in my surroundings. The trees, The sky, Even the very air I breathe -  It all seems so surreal,  As if they were masks created to convince my mind That knowledge is found through sight, That love is found through giving. I yearn to see beyond what is here, Not with my eyes Rather with my very being. There is something more. Something so unexplainable and uncomprehendable. Something that most people shall never see. Nor will they miss not seeing it, For they view the world only with their eyes. To open oneself up to the true source of vision is far too terrifying. Not because of what is seen, but rather for us to truly see,  We must become transparent, Totally exposing ourselves to this harsh world. Yet even more terrifying, we must view ourselves as we truly are. So, we convince ourselves that happiness is found solely  In our state of blindness. A lie that swallows our desire to see.   **This was written on 8-5-99 when I was struggling through depression and God's role in it all. It is so awesome to see what God has brought me out of!! Still I find these words an insightful reminder of how deceptive our world can truly be and even moreso, how deceptive we are with ourselves.**
The Point Between   Confusion steeps my soul with words much too difficult to say.  And I sit here. Here in complacency, Here in denial, Here is self absorption. I don't want to talk about it. Not because I don't want to deal with it but because I don't know how. How to express the thoughts I'm thinking.  How to make sense of the things I'm feeling.  It all seems so circular.  I don't even want to think about it  Because I keep ending up at the same points over and over again. The bottom line is that it doesn't make sense. Is it me or is it them? Now I don't even know.  And if it is me, then how can I truly know anything? At all? I can't. I don't. So I sit here. Here in confusion.  Here in hopelessness. Only is doesn't really feel like hopelessness anymore. It is beyond that. My brain is foggy. I want to give up. But for what? A life of ignorance? Can I ever truly be happy with these thoughts in the back of my mind, knowing that I would be living a lie? So now, the problem is ever before me. While the solution evades the entire plateau of reason. I'm tired of talking about what I want.  It doesn't make a difference anymore. I just don't even want to think about it My body is exhausted from the constant searching.  It must end. There must be an answer. But where? Not in the frail logic of man. Not in the ever-changing emotions of man. Not in the hypocritical actions of man. Not in man at all. It must be elsewhere.  In a place we continually try to overlook.  Our stupidity drives us in the opposite direction And our pride keeps us there. Now it is no longer just about me. No, now it is about the whole. Humankind. We continue to look the other way as salvation stares us in the face. But we can't give up what little we cling to. Somewhere along the way,  We were misled into believeing that this world is what our existence is all about. Pointless. Ignorant. We have tried to remove the true source of all that is. Thinking that we are the inventors, The discovers, The creators. Can we invent something that is already made? Can we discover what is already known? Can we create what has always been? We must relinquish this false power we believe we possess. For this is not the purpose. But still I sit here. Here as the whole. Here convicted of all that has come between. Here, I sit.  **This was written 2-26-00 during a time when I was struggling through some very tough doctrine and looking at it all in light of how we as Christians, as people, live these things out.**
The Cost of Love    The world crumbles around me, As the darkness rushes in. All the words I spoke in vain Tear and rip apart my skin. Exposing me to what is real Exposing me to truth. I lay here stripped and naked Looking everywhere but You.  This truth it hurts my wearied heart, It makes me cry aloud. I try to quiet my aching pains As I whisper through the crowd. I smile and laugh and pass You by As if the world is full of glee But every breath I take Brings me closer here - to me.  The darkness - it cannot prevail. Trembling I turn to face my fears. I feel some strength within me. I fight back the showers of tears. You have a plan and this I know A plan to bring me life, A plan to watch my darkest hours To call forth your wife.  I turn to You with tear-stained checks How bright Your light does shine. I realize now, that the darkness I saw Was only because I was blind. By choice I went and shut my eyes Darkness filled my vision alone But when I turned and faced your glory, Radiance flowed from Your throne.  I thank You God that You are King And that You are filled with love. For in my own power I can never attain Your blessings from above. But you have bought redemption You have sacrificed To live a life in love with me Paid at the highest price.
Freed to Dance   The space between dreams and reality is an ever-moving line. It dances. It spins. It twists and glides. Sometimes my heart is filled with thrill and awe. Sometimes - with aching and anguish. It all depends on how this space aligns itself. The moment of truth. This dance makes it difficult to know with certainty Which way to choose, Which path to walk, Which heart to trust, Which soul to touch. For one side can not make decisions based on the other. They each demand my all, Yet I yearn for the balance. I am pulled and torn and led away- Sometimes for good, Sometimes for bad. I ponder on God's design- His decision to place man in a real world But to give him a mind that can dream up another. Sometimes those dreams rip us apart. Other times they pull us together. So I will join the dance- Performed to the song of God's providence, Led by the hand of God's grace. Sometimes I might fall. Sometimes I might soar. But this space between the dreams and the real, Truly make life worth living for.
Untitled   Nothing is ever quite what it seems, As uncertainty spins its web, Clouding the hopes I treasured. I try to resist the trap, But I am taken in Through my desire to live, to love. This isn't how it's supposed to be. This isn't what you're supposed to say. I have rehearsed it over and over again On the stage of my mind. So follow the script And we will be alright. But you don't, so we aren't. What am I left with? Disappointment and depression. Can't we try it my way, Just this once?
Ode to a Night of Little Sleep   My head is foggy as exhaustion overcomes. Faint memories of hostilities expressed fill my mind. What I have feared my whole life is coming to fruition. The uncontrollable release of emotions leave me volatile and unpredictable. I yearn for balance. I desire control. These things evade my grasp.
Avoidance   Life is well.
My Coping Skills   The mind-numbing bliss of Coronas and Saving Silverman shake me from a day of despair. A day full of avoidance as sleep provided an escape from reality. Damn reality.
Words Float Away   I try to conjure the words to express what I feel. But I can not fabricate them within the confusion of my thoughts. I only get brief glimpses of sanity as my thoughts fly by too fast for me to grasp. The world goes on as if all is well. The sun still rises. The sun still sets. The darkness still consumes the night. And I am left alone to wonder when peace will make it's presence known. The mundane tasks of everyday life bring no passion to my heart. I lack direction. I lack desire. I'm tired of scooting through life doing just enough to get by. I am not able to muster enough strength to take hold of my dreams. I have been beat down by the world. My arms, once strong, are no longer able to lift me from my burdens. My legs, once muscular, are no longer able to carry me away from the pain. So, I sit powerless as the world overtakes me.
Another Day   Confusion weaves a web around my thoughts. I grasp blindly for something to cling to...some sort of stability. I am met with nothing but empty spaces. As fear consumes me, I transform into an anxious creature, knowing nothing but the fight for survival. Hostilities scream within my head, warring with harmony for my attention. They win. They always win. I fight for control. But I lose. I always lose. As I torment myself, a victim of my own thoughts, I wonder if I will ever know peace. My only choice is distraction. It's a struggle but at least it provides momentary hiatus from the war within. But all too quickly it's over as I'm left to face the harsh reality. Religion, independence, career, confidence, school, spirituality, relationships, family, drama, friends, hobbies, passions, words, prayers, self discipline, understanding, edification, partying, hurts, depression, wounds, dissapointment...my world crumbles around me. Balance is non-existent. My strength wears thin. I can not do it anymore.
Group Therapy    Hostilities continue to war with my sanity. It sucks. It's never been safe for me to express my emotions. So I've held on to them, internalized them. Now I'm screwed. I'm tired of all the Christian shit about denying yourself, sacrificing yourself, anger is bad, what would Jesus do....God gave us our emotions so I'm sure he intended for us to use them. Not to suppress them in the name of piety. I'm so tired of my life of deceit. Now I'm ticked and I don't care who knows it.
Fun   Mind-numbing skills increase as I seek to fill my head with anything but reality. I'm getting better at this task. A weekend of wild fun in Nashville made it easier to cope. My reaction of absolute bliss versus my friend's hangover pains makes me wonder. But I don't want to think too hard right now. It was fun and that's all that matters. Now I trudge through the task of milling through my entire life of torment as I sort out what went wrong and where. All this to the tune of a cursing elderly woman who is darn friggin good at dragging things out of people. All this in front of an audience struggling through the same shit. I pray that peace will come.
Sleepy   I feel exhausted...emotionally, mentally, physcially. It's amazing how life can affect you. I don't know if this is natural or medicine induced or a combination of both. But I am worn out. Unfortunately, I can't sleep. There is no time.
Overwhelmed.    I don't know what other word to describe how I feel. There seems to be so much that needs work. So much for me to do. I'm stuck. I want it all to just go away. I'm tired of having to think about these things. Having to ponder these things. I understand my problem but I still don't know what the hell to do about it. I continue to distract myself. Sometimes I'm successful. Sometimes I'm not. In the mean time, I'm not about to commit to anything with anybody. My brain is shot. I can't even think straight. There doesn't seem to be a hope through this. Everyone says there is but I just can't even fathom the concept. I'm tired of it all. My obessive thoughts will ever plague me. I guess I should accept the fact that my illness will ever be before me. I can't fix it. Others can't fix it. I don't think it can be fixed. I'm tired of the hurt and the pain and all the shit I've been put through. I don't even care anymore.
Ten Broeck    Yesterday was my last day for group therapy. I so came to love that place. Hours a day in the midst of honest communication. It was something that I was missing my whole life. It developed into an environment that was safe, calm, and loving with Mary as our surrogate mother cheering us on and ripping us new ones - whatever was appropriate. I miss it. I miss being able to share my thoughts and feelings with people actually listening and me receiving honest feedback. I miss listening to other people and understanding the different fixes we use to compensate for our lost self worth. I miss being able to say shit and hell without being judged. I miss being about to talk about sex in a realistic way without being condemned. I miss being able to talk about my somewhat psychotic thoughts with people who are honest enough with their own shit to admit they've been in similar situations. It's amazing. We all had the same problem, just different symptoms. I need to take what I've learned in this setting and transfer it to my reality. But I'm not quite sure how that will play out.   There are many things I have learned about myself. I know more about my problem and where it stemmed from. I'm learning to not be so critical of myself. It is so amazing how our childhood affects every aspect of our adulthood. Those messages that get stuck in our mind play throughout our lives. Sometimes they are good messages and that's awesome. But sometimes they are lies and that's when we have to step back and separate ourselves from them. I'm tired of the deceit. I'm tired of trying to live up to other people's expectations. I'm tired of wanting people to view me as some super Christian. I'm confused about how my spirituality plays into all of this mess. But I know I've been dished out some fucked up religious views that kept me in a life of shame and guilt.   Well, I guess I will take it one day at a time. Today, I'm realizing that my crazy obsessions that seem to control me are actually my attempt to create chaos in my life because it's my comfort zone. It's what I'm used to. Throughout my life, there has been much legitimate chaos. I became so used to it that when it wasn't present, I was uncomfortable. So I start to obsess over past things to fill that void. I need to continue to realize when I'm doing this and kick it in the ass. Self worth is another HUGE issue. I basically have none. I need to restructure my thinking away from false religious precepts that have held me in bondage and toward the truth. Fuck lies.
Baptists...Those Dirty Dogs   Ok, so maybe it's the baptists that I hate. After years of growing up under the legalistic dogma that did nothing for me but enhance a sense of shame, I'm realizing that maybe belief systems aren't absolutes, like I had been led to believe. Years of hiding my faults and elevating myself above others as a disguise is coming to an end. And I'm damn glad it is. This screwed up behavior wasn't a conscious effort on my part. It was all that I had known. When things get messed up, you hide it. When you make a mistake, you hide it. When your family embarasses you, you hide it. You don't talk about it. Don't even acknowledge it. This is NOT healthy.   Then you throw in the concept of religion and the stresses accompanying a world view that life demands perfection and so does Jesus. You have people who give you pre-fab answers to life's crappy events and stare at you like you're nuts for not tapping into 'God's peace.' I spent almost my entire life struggling with depression. Whenever I would try to talk to people about it, I would get fucked up answers like 'Whatever is worthy, noble, blah blah blah...think on those things', 'You may be unhappy with the circumstances but if you ask God, He will give you joy even in the  midst of it all' and 'What would our passive Jesus do...turn the other cheek and move on considering it an honor to suffer for Christ.' Ok, so then I pray my whole life and where is this peace....no where. I am angry and hostile on the inside but Jesus doesn't like angry people....so Jesus must not like me then. But what if I just hide the anger and suppress it...maybe He won't notice. Again, these aren't things that I consciously thought about but perspectives I had developed based on the attitudes of those around me.   I don't even want to start on the attitudes of the Baptists as a whole. My time at Seminary was by far some of the worst years of my life dealing with people. As a whole, the Seminary community cared more about proving a theological point to elevate themselves above others than they did about other people. It's so ironic because it should be the one place with the most caring people but it isn't. They sit around and gossip in the name of 'prayer requests', they spread rumors and lies with no regard to the people they are hurting, they are dishonest with the things they struggle with leading them to a lifestyle of hidden sin stuck in a perpetual cycle, they get more upset over petty things like language and immodest clothing than they do about the reason they are even at Seminary....because people are GOING TO HELL. My years spent there were one big lie. It was enveloped in deception. They twist God's word to make themselves look better. This is not what I see as the church when I read the Bible.   Then there's my church that I grew up in...a power hungry pastor elevated above questioning and bent on intimidating those he comes in contact with. A church that says shit to you when you wear jeans to church because everyone knows that Jesus hates those disrespectful jeans. So we must all dress up and act like everything is wonderful so other people at church will think we are super Christians, all the while we are falling apart on the inside. Our families are eroding...dads are fucking younger women, kids are doing drugs, moms are popping pills...then we dress up in our Sunday best and act like everything is wonderful. It's bullshit.   I hate the deception and I hate the lies. I've done it for so long but I'm finished. No more. I'm not going to live my life to make other people view me a certain way. I'm going to be myself. If people like me, then they like me. If they don't, oh fuckin' well because I'm not going to bend over and kiss my ass for every person who won't accept responsibility for their own shit.   I don't know how all of this will play out but I know that things are definitely changing and I kinda like it. I have the right to live a life of freedom and not hold myself under the burdens of this shitty world. So, that's what I'm going to do.
...                    All or Nothing              Black or White              Rigid or Open            Passive or Aggressive  This is what codependents flip between. It's one extreme or the other. Either side is unhealthy. You are to desire a balance between the two. But now, in my codependency, I have journeyed from the far left to the far right. I don't want to be screwed over again. I don't. And now I'm going to make sure that it doesn't. The problem is...I'm turning into a real bitch. To be honest, it feels good. But unhealthy none the less. I guess it's a process. I wish I knew how to find a balance...until then...I feel kinda bad for those who tick me off. I'm sure sooner than later I will feel remorseful for those I offend. Until then, I'm going to have fun with my new found freedom of speaking my mind.
beachchick     After a week in Myrtle Beach, I am quite dissappointed to wake up and not have a beach to run and play at in the mornings. The responsibilities of 'real life' smack me in the face. Vacation was so much fun. I am so glad I got to spend time with my fam (Mom, Lou, my sister Cindy, her bebe daddy Chris, my nephew Caleb, my step-nephew Tyler, my step-niece Taylor, my step-sister Amy, her husband Mike and my step nephew Alan) and also with Rachel. I was so excited to have a friend on my family vacation. It made the night time fun. It's amazing some of the shit we got ourselves into....all in good fun of course. It's so cool to go and meet new people and get to know them as well.     The first day we were there, we went parasailing. It was way fun. They make you sign your life over and keep saying it's for 'thrill seekers' but honestly it wasn't freaky at all. It was very relaxing. The banana boat ride out there was way more thrilling. Also the hot guys who operated the boat thing were more exciting. But I'm definitely glad I did it. It was very very relaxing.     The waves in Myrtle Beach are awesome!! Not as big as Cali but Cali waves are scary. Also, east coast water is warmer and easier to swim in. One night after it stormed. We went and fought the crazy waves for hours. It was sooooo friggin fun. We kept getting yelled at by the lifeguards because we were too far out!!! So much fun....for reals!!    We went out to eat at a seafood buffet place one night....actually it was a friggin Chinese restaurant that had a bunch of seafood. I felt ripped off but that's ok because we got all you can eat crab legs for $15. Rachel ate over 5 lbs of friggin crab legs....yeah, she likes food. We also went outlet shopping.....which seems to be my favorite past time lately. I got lots of fun stuff. There were a bunch of little shops along Ocean Blvd too. I got a cute little shirt for Caleb that said 'If you think I'm cute then you should see my aunt'. I had to buy it!!! I also got the cutest Corona outfit. I don't know why I'm so obsessed with Corona wear....probably because I'm pretty obsessed with Coronas....but you know....anywho, I got a cute little pink tank top with the Corona logo and a cute little white mini skirt thing with Corona written on the butt in pink.     Also, at one of the first stores we went to, I met this little asian guy, probably in his 30's. He worked there. We started talking and he mentioned competing in Aikido tournaments in Japan and I was like sweet. Cuz you really don't meet a lot of people who even know what Aikido is. So we talked for a bit. I don't know if he was hitting on me or what. It was weird. He was like maybe I can come to KY and teach you Aikido. He gave me his number and everything. I'm thinking um....ok. I don't quite trust him though because when I mentioned the name of the guy who started Aikido, Morhehei Ueshiba, he didn't know what I was talking about. And that's just weird. Oh well.It was weird. But cool to talk to a new person none the less.     The clubs in Myrtle Beach are  pretty fun. The first night we went out, we went to the House of Blues. They have a cute little deck bar area with a live band. We had a couple of drinks and were about to leave when the bartender came over and said this hot guy, Josh, wanted to buy us some drinks so...of course we didn't want to hurt his feelings. We ended up hanging out with him and his family and neighbors, who were all there on vacation, all night long. They were kinda wealthy. They bought us lots of drinks and we all danced (with all of them) and had fun. Seriously, they were all crazy!!! The whole family!!! They were staying in our same hotel so we all went back to their room and chilled. They were very cool people.  Plus Josh was hot....did I mention that???    The next night we decided to stay in and chill. We went all bummed out to the hotel bar and ended up having the most lame time of my life!! The woman who worked there was so annoying and harassed this guy for over 20 minutes about bringing alcohol into the bar. Finally I was like...WE MUST LEAVE NOW BEFORE MY BRAIN EXPLODES. She just wouldn't shut up about it.     So we got dressed up and went out to the Spanish Galleon which was kinda a lame club. We were bored out of our minds there too until we met Sean (Shawn?)....the coolest accountant in North Carolina. He was bored too so we started playing bar/club games to amuse ourselves. These consisted of dancing like retards in the cage (and amazing enough we fit in because most people there could NOT dance) and then picking out really ugly people or bad dancing people for each of us to go dance with. I made Rachel dance with this redneck with a mullett. Sean picked this bald funny looking guy in a 007 jersey for me to dance with. Unfortunately there weren't many busted girls for Sean to dance with so he got off easy. After that I spent the rest of the night dancing with Sean. He cracked me up to no end!! I wish he lived in Louisville because he is so the kind of guy that I go for....laid back and amazing sense of humor. I so regret not getting his contact info. Maybe I can find him with my stalker skills....who knows. Overall, it was a fun night with very little drinking. Probably the most fun I had.     The next night we drove down to the Freaky Tiki. This club is crazy. I later found out it's been on Wild on E and MTV. Fun times for us. We actually had gone to Mother Fletcher's first but it was lame. This older guy there bought us some drinks and then went with us to Freaky Tiki and hooked us up there as well. He was really nice and not creepy. Just said he wanted us to have a good time our last night there. Plus I think he liked walking around with 'hot chicks' (ha). Anywho....this place is nutso...it has beds with tables and stuff, flames all over the walls, tv's all over the walls. They even have a 'foam room' where you can dance in bubbles....really weird. Rachel went to take a picture and slipped on the steps and busted her ass. She has the biggest bruise now. It so sucks for her. We had to leave soon after that and on the way out this cute foreign guy started hitting me so I talked to him for a bit. Oh....I almost forgot....the boxer short contest!!! Fun times for the ladies.     That was the end of our fun. So sad. I am seriously sad. I wanna go back.  Ok, I'm done.
Reconciliation     Confusion still clouds my mind. Changes have been made. All or nothing has been epitomized. Things that used to mean everything to me now mean very little. I'm just tired. I feel as though I've spent my whole life trying to live righteously, putting others first and truly seeking a higher power. And now I'm just bitter. I've been run over, taken advantage of and treated like shit. I figured if this is how it's going to be, if my efforts are so in vain, then I'm going to live my life and have fun. Either way I'm screwed so I might as well enjoy it more.     It's just the inconsistancies in life that boogle my mind. For example, why is it that the 'good little christian' boys treat me like shit. They are disrespectful and twisted. And these are the people that are supposed to be good and encouraging. BUT...the drunk random guys from the clubs, they are quite respectful. When I say no, they say ok. Now what is up with this shit?!?!?!? It doesn't make any sense.     I feel like things are out of control. I know I'm being used but I'm using other people as well. So does it matter?? I don't feel bad. I don't feel guilty. I do feel somewhat uneasy if I think really hard about it. But I'm not sure if that is guilt from my actions or from my legalistic past that would tell me to never even speak with people who lived their lives in such a way. It's fucked up. So I'm just going with the flow, trying to survive. I am having more fun which is cool. I feel more free.     I'm having a hard time reconciling these things in my head. Beliefs, actions, values, virtues.....how do they all interact???
The weekend was great. Sat we celebrated Nicole's Graduation at Sam Woo's (check carlene's blog for pictures) then headed back to the house for more socializing and drinking.  Sunday juss had a chill day, went to hooka with Carlene, ate In-and-Out and rented Mooseport (that movie with Ray Ramano)pretty good movie.  So today we're headed to watch the game and have B.B.Q. with some new friends we made Sat (Paolo and Janelle). They both do archery and thats something Carlene and I have always wanted to try so I'mma take a shot at it when we head there in about 15 mins...Look out Orlando =P  Oh and today is Game 5 of the Lakers and Wolves... 3-2 Lakers, hmmmm I wonder how this is gonna go down. I can't lie a little part of me is routing for the under dogs but I can't be too open bout that or I'll be shot here in LA...enven though they ain't in the runnings I have to say it...'go raptors'...k YAY LAKERS WOOOOOOOO!!
The time now is 3:11 pm and I'm still at work but I just had to blog about the good news! Kay, heres the run down:  Carlene has been looking for an internship in the field of Graphic Design so that she can gain some early on experience before entering fully into her career.  So she had contacted a few places and this one place, I believe they're called 'Creative Imagination'; had called her in for an interview. They we're looking to hire someone for a 'paid' internship ...That's right paid baby! So this was the perfect opportunity for Carlene to get the experience under her belt AND get paid for it. She was a little nervous and wasn't sure if she'd get it but....  SHE GOT IT!!! UN HUH! *does a funky victory dance*  Yep she just called me and I almost went into tears, thats how happy I am for her... that and she can help pay rent now hehehehe jk! No really I am so proud of her, she truly is an awesome designer.. she thinks I tell her that just cuzz I'm her bf but it's true. I don't know anyone else who takes time to really think outside the box. I mean her design and concepts go far beyond her instructors expectations and being that I am in the same industry I can honestly say that we need more designers like her.  CONGRATULATIONS BABY! I'm sooo proud of you! Let's celebrate tonight, dinner and a movie on me k? Love ya!
T-minus 4 hours 3 mins 12 sec till gym time. I woke up 5am this morning too groggy to do anything so I X'd the gym routine this morning and instead I'm gonna meet Carlene at L.A. Fitness @ 6pm to try and catch a Spin class and then do some weight training. K back to work...
urlLink    'WHATCHU MEAN SHE'S SCARED!?!?'&nbsp;  This picture was taken when Carlene and I decided to have ourselves a lil' picnic. Yep we had the picnic basket, blanket and everything. We went to this park her mom used to take her and her sister when they were young.  It was nice to kick back, relax and watch our Penelope (our dog) frolic around in her american flag dress Carlene's mom got her from the Philippines. I know she's spoiled but can you really say no to that face? I mean really...
I know I know...you're probably thinking, isn't Sonny doing the whole living healthy thing? I am it's just that this weekend I slipped. Well maybe not the entire weekend, lets break it down:  Friday: - went over to Carlene's in Chino Hills - watched Shrek 2 (kick ass movie) - snacked on some candies and junk food (it begins)  Saturday: - help clean up the house - wash the cars - made BBQ steak for dinner (not bad but it was late)  Sunday: - Connected and networked Carlene's mom and sister's computers to the web - Watched the Laker game - Bought and ate Bravo Burger (all hell broke loose)  Yep it was a pretty sad site. If you could only see the carnage this food caused. I mean we juss lay on the floor and couldn't move. Looked like somone dropped a bomb and we were the after-math.  So tonight it's time to hit the gym and burn off those weekend calories. Other than that I feel good and work right now isn't crazy hectic so I'm glad.  Pictures coming up soon...
If you were to look at my life right now, thats what some might say. In some aspects, my life is just that...boring. I hate to say it but I have become soooo routine.  Everyday I... â¢ wake up â¢ exercise â¢ go to work â¢ come home â¢ Q.T. with Carlene â¢ sleep  And it just repeats. I know once something becomes routine sooner or later it becomes boring and I fear that is what I am becoming. Partially because, and I think this could be one of the many reasons... I don't have a lot of my own set of friends here, sad but true and it's partially my own fault.  It'll be a year next month since I moved from Canada to sunny California and I must admit it's hard to make friends outside of Carlene's group of friends. I figure it was easier back in the day because I was still in school and it was just easier to meet people on a daily basis who were in your age group and had similar interests. Now that I'm done school and working the making friends thing is a little harder.  I can't use the whole...' I just moved here from Canada' bit because 1 yr is more than enough time to adjust. I need to get out more, join groups or something and I'm gonna start doing just that this weekend. Well tonight I'm heading back to Carlene's place in Chino and we might hit up a grad party, then tommorow nite is her friend's b-day so we'll do that but on Sunday I'm free to go back to Costa Mesa and figure out what there is to do. What groups are there to join around my apartment. I wanna stay away from the Club and Bar scene, I am so over that part of my life....but what else is there to do? Thats my new task, to try to make my life NOT routine and to find new and interesting things to do and if I happen to make some friends along the way bonus...  On a good note....NO MORE MOHAWK!!!! Thats right, mohawk just for one day. I couldn't take it no more so yesterday after work I went to go get it fixed. It's really short right now but it's better than what I had before...WAAAAAAY better =)  I'll start adding pix and updatiing you guys bout my new adventures real soon...
It's been a while since I had a decent hair-cut and as of late it looks like I've been in desparate need of one. Now if your anything like me I'm picky with who cuts my hair and i takes a long time to actually find a barber/salon who can cut my hair without me having to worry about wearing a hat or calling in sick the next day.  I had that comfort zone with a particular salon back in Canada and they've been cutting my hair for over 7 yrs. But now I moved to Cali, things have changes and I have to start from scratch. Son in my search I've had to deal with 'Super Cuts' and 'Fantastic Sams' and even a place called 'Hair Cutters'. They all were decent cuts but not really to my liking.  My search lead me to what was near my apartment which I have just moved into recently so I'm still getting familiar with the area. And what do you know, there's a Paul Mitchell Salon just round' the corner from my apartment. Carlene had taken the liberty of making an appointment for me @ 8pm last nite. I was happy that it would only cost me $10, sweetness...but did I mention it was a Paul Mitchell SCHOOL!?  Yep I had agreed to get my hair cut done by a student with full knowledge my hair is no easy task, with 3 collics in my head, weird shape and on top of that my hair cut before was masacred by a little asian lady who cut my hair wearing over-sized latex gloves....At first I thought wow she must be very hygenic but not too smart wearing gloves that are too big while cutting peoples hair with sharp tools! Then I saw posters on the wall with her in a doctors uniform and the big gloves toting a pair of sheerss with the headline saying : 'Who's gonna operate on your head today?'  Fear and disbelief filled my mind and sure enuff she messed up my head...But all thats ok now since I'm going to The Paul Mitchell School to get it fixed right? Well I get in at 8 and I wait for say 15 mins. The place is packed, I guess a lot of people were wiling to get their heads done so I wasn't so worried at that moment. Then I hear my name called out and this guy Justin comes out, a punk-ish into the import car scene kinda guy. Nice guy but.....in the two hours it took for him to cut my hair he managed to butcher my head all the while I'm thinking 'it's gonna get better, it's gonna get better, I don't have my glasses on so it must look ok, it's gonna get better'.....  2 hrs later and I walk out with a wack ass MOHAWK!!!!!!! k it's not too bad but a mohawk??....I don't think I'll be heading back to that slaughter house anytime soon. Maybe it's because I go my hair cut done by a phase one student, I should have got it done by a phase two for $5 more...Dammit. Oh well hair is hair and it'll grow back rite? *forced smile*  I think I'll head to a salon after work to get it fixed.....*ponders the thought*  To be continued....
'...and now I hit publish...dammit...'  yep that kick ass blog entry I thought I had published durring my lunch break today somehow didn't go through...poop on a stick.  Maybe if I feel like it I'll re-cap what happened today later tonight, but the question of the moment is...Where is Carlene??.... she's at school =(  I got home from work and she's not here, I can't call her cell cuzz she left it at her moms....Now I know what Carlene means when she's says it sucks to be at the apartment alone....well I'll juss sit here and read some books till she gets back.  Tonight is movie night so when she gets back we'll walk to Hollywood Video ....=)
Juss saw my bank statement...it's diferent from yesterday, ALOT different. So right now I feel a little crappy.  I also finished reading my gf's blog entry about how there's a site for imaginary gf's and you have to pay for it, how sad... yeah imagine doing a spin off to that site... 'perfect boyfriends' cuzz you know perfect boyfriends are imaginary....funny stuff  Well at least tomorrow is pay day...yay
Ok...Since I lost my Clie (PDA), I know sucks ass!!!! I need to find an alternate way to give myself reminders of things to do or specific dates. So, being that I'm on the computer all day at work I might as well use my blogger for this purpose, well until I buy a new PDA oh and get Carlene one too. (I know she really wants one even though she swears by her traditional pocket organizer)  Having my own apartment is pretty cool, there's just a few things I need to get like cable...Well I can live without cable since I don't watch alot of TV plus it gets me to do other things like read books! I'm currently reading 2 books: 'Marketing Plan' by Don Debelak and 'The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership' by John C. Maxwell. I'm really diggin' both books from what little I read so far, both will help me in my future plans in terms of where I'd like my career path to go.  Well thats all for tonight, gonna watch a movie Carlene and I rented 'Girl With The Pearl Earing'.  K here's da list for 05/13/04:  - email Carlene with the response email I got from one of the graphic designers - 11am meeting with kustomerkinetics - finish outlining and color correct AJ's bags to upload to the web - make the changes for the Berkley site and upload b4 the end of the day  - work on NYX header cards and display boards
Early 90's music blasting in the office??? OH HELL YEAH!! The other day Rudy and I started talking about music and 90's music entered our convo. Names like C&C Music Factory and PM Dawn popped up.  We even found out each others obsession with Milli Vanilli. Rudy went as far as to getting his hair braided, I on the other hand had made a home music video lip syncing to 'Girl you know it's true' with a Mop head fastened to my noggin. Yea I know....dork, but you find me one person at that time when no one knew they were fakes who didn't like them....you liked them, yeah....you did.  So anywayz, that convo sparked me to download a bunch of song's from the early 90's. I even got this one mix that's 1 hr long....awwwwwwwwww g'yeah!!!!!!!!!! Let's get this party started right....let's get this party started quickly!
Well it's been a really long time since I have attempted to blog, and the truth is I was just gettin lazy and was just finding it hard to make time for it. But then tonight Carlene had told me how blogspot had a new setup for their blog sites...Comments now? Shut Up!  So we both got on the site and signed me up. This is good...getting back to blogging since my family is in Canada and I talk to them like once every 2 weeks, it gives them an outlet to see how I'm doing on a daily basis.  So with that here's the run down  to get you guys up to speed with whats happening in my life:  - I'm still with my wonderful gf Carlene - I moved into an apartment in Costa Mesa - got a kick ass bed set and mattress for choice price with help from Carlene - still with that Marketing Advertising Agency KMG and things are going well - going back to Canada June 23rd for a week to visit family and friends - Oh and did I mention I turned a quarter century last month yay  Thats all I can think of right now, I'll post some pictures up and blog in more detail soon...I miss my puppy =(
urlLink     Yep, it's official! Our little Penelope has made her way to  urlLink DOGSTER.COM!   Carlene's sister  urlLink Nicole  signed Penelope on a Friendster like website for dogs, it's cute and Penelope already has friends how funny! I better do a background check on them...hmmmmm
yes yes I know I haven't posted in a long while, for that matter my site wasn't even up so I do apologize. But now that it's back up, it's back to business.  Here's the breakdown update:  - Next week on the 29th I'll be on a plane with Carlene back to Canada to visit my family and friends whom I haven't seen in roughly 1 yr.  - My company is moving to another building so new environment new energy, just good things all around   Um there's more but I'm on my lunch break and it's almost over so I gotta bounce. I'll be back later tonight to finish this update =)
(The Scenario) On my way to work, driving on the 5 fwy and I start to have an un-easy feeling. Can't quite explain it but something inside me felt weird. No it wasn't the food or the hooka I had last night with Carlene, Jill and Sarah (That was fun btw, Jill and Sarah are welcome anytime at the Apt.), it was something else.  So I arrive at the office on time and punch in. Lorraine (my co-worker) arrives soon after. I begin the usual 'Good morning' and proceed with small talk. The topic of the last episode of 24 came up and she was telling me about bombs attached to some guys arm and having to chop it off with an axe, more bombs and terrorists ish....  *ring, ring*  All eyes on the office phone...I pick it up.  Me - 'Good morning, Kurianski Media Group' Caller - *muffled*  'What suite are you?' Me - 'Pardon me? You'll have to speak louder, it's very difficult to hear you...'  *now un-muffled I can hear him clearly this time with a middle eastern accent*  Caller -  'What suite are you? I am outside RIGHT NOW!'  *After talking bout 24 with bombs and terrorists, my mind starts running and I must admit I was a little thrown off*  Me - 'um...who do you want to see or what is this concerning?' Caller - 'I am outside! Tell me where you are!'  --  Turns out he's this dude who's supposed to pick up a CD with files he's paying for. So in the end he wasn't some guy who wanted to bomb my place of work. He just wanted a CD and gave me $60 for it.  I knew it all along... ;)
The time now is 11:08 am. As I have said earlier the company I work for  urlLink KMG , has just moved to  a new building and so today a guy named 'Gus' from ADT is installing the system.  Seems like a normal day so far untill I walk past him while he's on the ladder... Not before, not after I pass him but while I am right beside him...he lets one RIP!!!! *FART* Oops he's says with a childish grin. Man right at that moment I was filled with so many mixed emotions, I didn't know weither to say gross out loud, gag and say 'excuse me I'mma go shower now'.  Yep this day seems interesting already...
I know I know... I promised to update more frequently and I'm not. It's just that ever since I got back from Canada it's been hectic here in sunny Cali. Work especially has been a whirl-wind of over-time to catch up on jobs and to complete new ones, oh and did I mention we moved to a new building!?  So on top of all that work we had to deal with the move durring the week. Now that we're here at the new building we still got to paint the walls cuzz you know to be a Marketing/Advertising/Design Firm we can't just have plain white walls, we need some splashes of color to get our creative juices flowing =) We're also removing the grey carpet and putting down hardwood.  I have taken some pictures of our move and the new location so I will post that up a little later. Also I got pix from rafting, not the pix you've seen already on Carlene's or Nicole's site but ACTION shots supa coooool hahaha.  Ne wayz I will post that all real soon but for now I gotta get back to work, just wanted to post to make sure that the one or two of the people that do read my daily ramblings besides Carlene and her sis know that I am posting and that this site is not static...er stagnet...or whatever you wanna call it... I posted dammit! THERE!   -- peas
Yep after a long hiatus I'm back. Sorry I haven't been updating as much, I've just been real busy with work and all which I will get into later but first.....  Picture Time!!!

Stealthy Assignment                                          It had been 6 hours since the briefing.  The previous night, a special ops meeting had taken place in an American outpost just outside of Warbah, Kuwait.  Attending, had been Joshua Bradley, a member of the American delta force.  Bradley had been called to rescue another member of the Special Forces that had been captured earlier in the week. Not only to rescue him, but to also reacquire his explosives and destroy the bridge that should have already been in rubble.  The POW, Jim Foley, along with another of his comrades, was sent to destroy a bridge, on the Iraqi, Kuwait border; 50 miles south of Umm Qasar.  However, guards spotted them and Foley was captured.  Thus Bradleyâs call.  Taken to the outpost, he was briefed on the situation and put on the helicopter to the Kuwait Iraqi border.    Sitting in the helicopter now, Bradley sweated.  Just thinking of the job he had to do overwhelmed him.  According to the intelligence compound, he was going to have to pass through the guards and checkpoints unnoticed.  If the alarm was raised, then things would become difficult.  In the cockpit, the pilot glanced back at him and noticed that he was studying his map.  Indeed he was, he wasnât given a GPS this round.  They would take to long to connect to the satellite and, at worst, might be pin pointed giving away his position.  A bump jolted him from his studying.  He looked up and saw the drop point.  His rifle, a colt m-167A with an attached grenade launcher, sat ready in his hands. It was just before dawn, the sun was already beginning to rise, and the dew had already soaked into the ground.  âOk! This is it!â  That was his cue.  The helicopter was 15 feet above the ground; it was time to go.   Bradley slid to the ground on rope.  He watched as the helicopter sailed away.  In his mind he could still hear his commanding officer, âOk, just get in, get Foley, get the C4, blow the bridge, get out.  BUT! Remember! If the alarm is raised, youâre probably toast.  Stealth is everything.â    It was quiet now, the helicopter was already on its way back to base, and he was alone.  He crunched his way through the underbrush and scoped the area.  He was in a canyon.  There were two sheer, smooth rock walls on either side.  A way down the path, there was a steady decline in the terrain. The path wiggled side to side in the same fashion of switchbacks.  A small building was at the landing.  Across from the building was a ditch the spread the length between either side of the canyon walls.  A bridge, large and strong, strong enough for a tank Bradley noted, was on the far left side of the ditch.  Carefully, he inched his way to the first low drop on by the top of the switchback.  On the landing were three trucks one crossing the bridge and the other two waiting in line.  Suddenly, the roaring sounds of a jet sounded. Frantically he looks around, fearing that it would give away his position.  Interestingly enough, it was an allied A-10 Warthog.  Squinting, he could make out something falling from the planeâs bomb bay.  The ordinance howled as they pounded the tow trucks on the landing. The third made it over the bridge.  On impact, a man ran out of the building.  He was armed.  Seeing this, Bradley scrunched down even lower.  As he steadied his rifle the sights were leveled.  The rifled sounded off as three shots burst through the crisp air.  As another soldier saw his fellow on the ground, he looked up and spotted the sweating Specialist.  As the enemy opened fire so did Bradley.  Having a better weapon and training far exceeding his opponentâs, the combatant fell quickly.  Upon seeing his opponent on the ground, acting rather un-life like, he stood up and made his way down the path.  However, another soldier came across the bridge.  Seeing Bradley, he took cover behind a sign near the bridge.  A sign doesnât hold up very well against a grenade.  Neither does the man behind the sign.  Continuing down the path, he trotted towards the building on the landing.    Entering, he found a radio, medical supplies, and a refrigerator that had food in it, but was unplugged.  Not really finding another use for any item except the medical supplies, which he had already commandeered, he left.  After crossing the bridge, the path took two different routes.  One of which turned right and led up to a checkpoint. The other route went through another canyon and split into many different paths.  Having been warned to avoid detection, he decided upon the left route.  Walking cautiously down the path, he observed that the sun was fully raised.  Avoiding detection would be more difficult now than ever.  Ah, man! One wrong step and Iâll land myself in the pit with the rest of the MIAs.  Bradley tensed with every sound, watching cautiously around every corner.  He was in a small canyon, with rock on either side, smoothed by the blowing sand, and nothing but sand and dirt in between.

It really is late. You can tell by the way I'm typing that i'm a bit tired. I've been staying up late for the last three days. But no more of that, time for a random quote... Aha! ZuluChim: hey-ness Pharsalus8948: is that like what a horse says while he's eating with a long face at a bar? ZuluChim: very much like that           That was a bit random. I need to post a story that I've written, but it is very long and I don't want to post it all at once. After I post this blog, i will post one portion of my story, then so on and so forth.
I was taking a nap, but then, here it comes. The foreboding call through the house. I was almost asleep when it came. What's this? A sibling needs help with his scooter? Oh no! It's coming this way! Do the sleep act! Quickly I bury my face in the cushions of the couch. I need heellp. Please, hey, wake up! Hello? I try to filter out the calls for aid. Failing at that, I pull the cranky Lord-of-touch-me-and-you're-dead act, and lo and behold it worked. I settle back into my nap..Ah, it's been a good day. My friend came over, stayed up late working on a lost cause escapde  that had been destined to fail since we set out, then I had passed out on the couch. I woke up and took the role of couch potato, then talked to a few friends by way of keyboard, and then ate some food. As I contemplate all this I am rudely interrupted yet again by a more urgent call. My Wheel is coming off! So I grunt, get up, and come outside. AaUgH! The sun! I need my sunglasses. I come back inside, get my sunglasses, and it comes to pass that the bolt had broken. Therefore the wheel was coming out. In my great genius, I don't search for the same size bolt, but find a small bolt with and place large discs on either end. With help from a friend, I tighten the bolt and it works! I, am a skilled metal worker. Well, maybe not, but there is my episode for today. Tune in tomorrow...well, not tomorrow, just later. I'll put something else amazing here. Caio!
Yahoo! My dad is home! From Dallas! Where he has to work! And soon we'll move down there...! Good and bad, but he has a job there, so that's mostly good. Right? of course right. So he came back today after the final performance of vbs (yay, yay...) and taking my great grandmother some food...that's better than the goo they try to give her. But, now for the meaning of the title...Since i am going into highschool and all that fun stuff, i'll be going a few places by myself and doing things for long periods of time away from parental supervision. So, naturally, i need a way to check in with my folks. (who says folks?) And so, my dad got me a cell phone. Yahoo! I can call anyone in my family for free! So if you want to talk to me, you can call me so you will pay for the time, and i won't! But i can't talk long because i have a limited amount of minutes. And if you want to talk more than a bit (for what reason i don't know) call after 9 pm cause then i get unlimited minutes...but that doesn't really matter because no one knows my phone number! and that's the way it's going to stay. Not because i don't want to talk to you, well maybe i don't. But maybe i do. So now I'll just leave you in suspence forever. My brother and mom and dad all got new cells, and there's can take pics, but mine is great for me. And I'm happy, I wasn't going to get one, but then he got this one. So there you go. Out for now, I'm wiped. No...as in exhausted.
The movie Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock is one of the weirdest, most twisting mysteries I've ever seen.  It's kinda scary too. The people are a bit insane, you don't know what is going on, and it has Jimmy Stewart, He's on of the best. Great movie though. It's the kind of thing me and my friends would get together and watch at midnight. Then talk about until 4 in the morning. I'd be so tired after that.                  I let time run away last night, and i need to compensate for yesterday's lack of sleep. Tomorrow looks more promising for something cool to happen. Like a giant storm or something. That'd be awesome. Out for now.
...back by popular demand. 'What is that? I looked at it and was like, uh, who is that? and how can anyone pronounce it anyways? fwarsurulas? What is that?' Then of course, I am SOOOOOOOooo stupid! Haha! that was great! if you come up with any other let me kno!
This week is crazy. I'm being a staff member for vacation Bible school at my new church. That goes from 9am-12:30. It's not to bad; the little kids are good, but when you get to fourth and fifth grade it's time to bring out the whip. I have mucho grande child herding skills under my belt, two little brothers the same age, and I helped with Sunday school for two years at my older church. There is a fine line between being overly nice, resulting in anarchy; and being horribly mean, which results in tyranny. Which isn't all to bad, but then they don't obey you until actually move towards them threateningly. Some people find a small niche in the middle of that line, and they can control people firmly, but be a popular person at the same time. For instance, if i said, 'you need to sit here, ok?' and they do it without question. That's the niche every child herder looks for. I was offered to go to a game night tomorrow night, but I don't think i'd be able to participate in anything. I stayed up way to late last night. Then i only got 5 hours of sleep. urk. I was very tired. So I got home and passed out on the couch. Great experience. I didn't really pass out...it was a figure of speech. The grand finali is friday night at 6:30. At TBC's old building. Now Memorial Bible Church. Finally, the thing i won't enjoy the most week is raking my entire back yard. Oh joy. Dead grass litters it, so i go out to rake it all in. Still have to do it, but it's really hot right now. I'm doing it in heats..hehe, heats? Heats as in a race heat, a heat as in it's hot heat. Man, that heat must be getting to me. Oh well, time for the third heat. I'll come back and post some even more corny jokes later. Chaio!
If you could type a cry of anguish, it'd be here. This isn't any regular mowing, this is thick grass that must be cut every other day and my mower doesn't have a bag. That makes for one nasty yard when you're done with it. And I can't mow it during the full day, because I'd roast. Heat index and all.  So I have to wait till afternoon or morning. But, then again, it does make you buff after awhile, mowing and raking and all that fun stuff. And a bit sore too. But that's ok.  Time for an excerpt:  Pharsalus8948: my hands are sore ZuluChim: from? Pharsalus8948: i just finished mowing\raking our front yard  ZuluChim: oh Pharsalus8948: that was as thick as cheese off of a spinner Pharsalus8948: .....that was an interesting metaphore ZuluChim: uh...yeah....I was thinking the same thing  I have huge callouses on my hands though.  Going to be tough to get splinters in them now. My hands are sore at the moment, however, so typing must wait. Out for now.
I just ate dinner. A BLT..mmm, it wasn't warm or anything, but still. A BLT can hit the spot without you even knowing you want one. This must be a great food day. I had an icee from quik trip, and it never seemed to end. I had calzone for lunch from simple simon's. They don't have the greatest pizza, but they're calzone is the best that i've ever had. They baste it in some garlic butter\italian sauce. I had six pieces. I felt like i was about to explode.  But it tasted good, so it was all worth it. Now tonight I had a BLT. And it hit home. I didn't even know that I wanted one, but now I know.                  I'm going to help with Vaction Bible School with my new church tomorrow. Supposed to be helping the little guys sing along with the songs during the music part. I wasn't going to do it, I was a reserve of sorts. However, word of my incredible skills for herding children got out. So now I'm going to be helping with that from 9 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon. During this time, I will join and begin training on a swim team, mow the yard twice, and continue in my latin lessons. I have a very full week. Then I do it again (in a sense) next week. Except it's a camp for my age. Very full. I also might get a small, part time job detailing and cleaning out cars. Amazingly enough. I feel exhausted just talking about it. Maybe I'll go mow the yard if it has cooled down at all. It was\is so hot today. Heh, but then, I remember, that someone was burned much more than me. I'll come back and write something amazingly insightful later. Now, Onward to learning about better mechanical amusements, and business opportunities.
My word, that was the most stupid, retarded, and absolutley random hilarious movie(because it was so bad) probably this year! The costume desginer was a real duck...that's right, a duck, because they had no taste. I don't think ducks have tongues that can taste like human tongues. He's supposed to be this guy that can go through amazing stuff. But he gets shot and schooled. Then he becomes the king of the greatest empire of the world just like that. Not a bad spot, but no plot....not even a turn..Just hopping from one place to another as randomly as  a frog burping in a pond. Oh yes, that random. Don't see it, the worst 5 dollars i ever spent. Actually, the worst cause i ever spent 5 dollars on; nothing wrong with the dollars.                                                      Time to sleep.
Yet again, I run into technical difficulty. I cannot edit my profile. From my profile when I'm signed on at my computer, or from the Dashboard. And the dashboard is getting different links on it all the time while taking off others...kind of annoying. On a better not i got to wash the car and get somewhat of a tan. And eat hotdogs. So there you have it. Out for now.
It was so nice to wake up and have my dad here.  He's working in Dallas at the moment, but he got to come home for the weekend. My brother went to Ft. Gibson and he didn't wear sun screen.  His stomach and chest is SO sunburned. That's what happens, as I know all to well.  My dad took my entire family out to eat lunch.  We went to cheddars, one of my favorite resturaunts. I had the Rajun Cajun Chicken. As always, it was premium. Then we had a fudge desert and i about lost it. But, with my amazing will power, I saved everybody the trouble.  Then we went to look at PDAs. That would stand for Personal Digital Assitant. Not Public display of affection. Which is really annoying. The pocket PCs were cool too. But we don't know which one is the right one yet. They're cool...and expensive...i need some money...not for one of those, just money in general...Anyway, after that we went to the at&t cell phone place to look at those. I'm going to get a cell phone soon because i'm going into highschool, and my dad can get a certain kind of cell phone(which is pretty cool) for free. But not until we have a dallas residency for a dallas number.  We went to Barnes and Nobles right after that. Dilbert comics ensued. They're hilarious. Some of them are over my head, but I get most of them. Being a comic writer would be interesting to have as a your major occupation. You'd have to be funny, have a good sense of humor everyone can relate to, and be a fairly good artist. Then you have to convince your local paper to accept another comic strip in the Sunday paper. A very important boost to a one's profession.  I went to see my Great grandmother after that at the land of doom rehab center. She's the best person there. She hurt her ankle pretty bad, so she has to get it back up to walking strength. That'll take awhile.  That place though...Ehuaheuh! Ugh, it's out to get you, the smell penetrates you and goes right through your chest until it aches. I want to get her out of their. Already I'm formulating an escape plan...that includes mile long systems of under ground tunnels....That'd take awhile to dig.  It's a long term escape plan. Just like a trip to Russia on foot. Time waits for no one, not even me while I'm blogging, so I gotta go!
Yahoo! I went paintballing today.  I woke up early(well,8:30 someodd) and walked around trying to decide if i should do nothing, or if I should do nothing in a different style. I went to tim's house and got there at around 10:20.  We didn't actually leave until around 11:00.  ...only becase JASON didn't get his co2 before he came. ;-) We drove back down to the woods we were going to play at, then unloaded our stuff, suited up completly, and walked, guns in hand, in search of the other guys we were playing with that had already gone out there. We reached a small clearing where we saw one of the guys motion to us and tell us that they were in the middle of hunting a small child.  YES he was playing too. He was just hiding, and he did have a paintball gun with him to defend himself.  Real short kid. We couldn't find him, so he gave up. Kind of backwards. Then i was going to test fire my gun because i hadn't shot it today. But no, of course, it didn't work. Safety off, co2 full, paint in the hopper, no fire.  So now i'm serioulsy peeved and annoyed. Peeved because it won't work, and annoyed because i don't know what's wrong with it and i don't know how long or how much it will take to fix it. Now it is getting towards noon and it is very warm and verry humid. So we decide to take to the woods. We find a nice spot that's shaded, and has a small stream running through one part of it.  And a swing was in the middle of a clearing there. A nice place for paintball. It wasn't really fair, because I now had to use a winchester paintball gun, that wasn't excellent, and one of my partners had the same kind of gun. My other teamate had a tippmann 98 with a lapco bigshot, and a stock. It was very nice. I also let him use my electronic hopper which allowed him to shoot really fast. The first game i was shot in the elbow while crawling\kneeling over the top of a hill. They got the flag that time. The second time we started on the other side, and i shot more. Still, no range. So i try to get closer. I crawl up towards this tree, and i'm in the underbrush so no one can see me. I'm also flat on the ground so it's kind of hard to crawl with a paintball gun. I get to my tree, and it just so happened, that if i lean any space at all to my left, I'm in the line of fire of an enemy.  Same story for my right. I eventually got shot in the knee by the little kid. He had a pretty good gun though. My other teamate, tim, was trying to flank, but he got shot right between the eyes on his mask from a Tippmann A-5. With a very accurate barrel.  But it was cool crawling because i was getting shot at. The paint splat on my friend's mask was awesome. He took a picture of it. Then accidentally erased it. So we shot his mask again. Then we did some defending stuff. Me, the little guy, and Jason with the tippmann 98, went over the stream and on to the other side. The enemy's job was to eliminate or cross the river.  I was the first to go. Naturally.  I was moving up to take down this guy right across the stream, but NO RANGE!! I accidentally shot tim. Hehe, he was reffing and taking pictures. Thus my profile picture. So then, the A-5 guy shot me with his amazingly accurate gun.  So i was out and had nothing else to do, so i swang on the swing. (oh yes, i swang) and supplied paint to people that were running out.  Then we walked back through a very hot path. (i didn't even wear my camo jacket. it was to hot. So i just went with my white under shirt.) back to a very hot car and drove home to a nice cup of cold water. So there is the epic of my paint ball experience in the woods. (hopefully not the last one)
Here I am writing once again. I baby sat my little brother, even though he's ten years old.  Babysitting is just a term. Regardless of whoever is getting watched.  Which can be annoying.  I'm paintballing tomorrow at a stand of trees and a small field. It should be fun as long as i don't run out of C02. It's going to be awesome! Get to test out my new paintball gun....and light up tim...hehe, oh yes, i'm coming for you. Unless we're on the same team in which case we'll have to co-operate. It's great that it doesn't get dark until nine o'clock.  You can go play something outside until it gets dark, then you can come inside, eat dinner, take a shower or whatever, and it's already time to go to sleep! Or you can be nocturnal and stay up till dawn and sleep all day.  I know a few people like that. Little one calls, time to go! Chaio!
At first, I had attempted to write a poem, but I decided to leave that to people that are actually gifted.  I felt inspired yesterday when I saw the clouds rolling around, but today......I just don't have it.  But there are storms here.  Oh yes, storms a plenty. I have been driven to my storm shelter 4 times this year.  They call it Tornado Alley for a reason. As opposed to other places like 'Missouri, land of discovery' or something like that.  I can discover something in montanna if I wanted to. But I don't, so haha. If you think that was a bit odd, please read the disclaimer in small print at the top of the page.  Now you're going to look at the top of the page and see what it says.  I actually don't know that for sure; just a guess.  And this has gone all over the place.  Back to storms.  I love storms. Some people don't. I love the rain, the smell of the storm before it strikes, the color of the sky after the clear, sounds echoing throughout the entire enduring cell.  Lightning with flashes so bright that you are blinded in the darkness that surounds you created by the presence of the clouds. Other people that don't like storm are a bit odd to me.  Great way of displaying God's creation.   It's pitch black outside.  But you know what they say, it's always darkest right before it goes pitch black.  So now, I'll have to leave the rest of this space empty.....just like outside.....except outside it's black and not empty, and here it's black and empty.  So decided which one you want to believe.  Chaio!

I just got a day-timer\planner\ deal. It's kind of sad that I have to had a daytimer DURING the summer.  Oh well, I guess it's good practice being organized and 'neat'  during the summer so I'll be ready for next school year. Neatness isn't one of my strong points......but it will be. I'll make it one of my strong points.  I will Triumph!(my el guapo is disorganization)  Well, it probably won't be that glorious, but I'll get it down. This html thing is still plauging me...But that too! I will triumph!  I need an army doing all this triumphing.  Maybe I'll go hire one.  Alright, I'm out to hire an army, I'll be back.
I'm back from the land beyond.....the computer chair.  I went to see Hidalgo last night at the 50 cent movies.  For the 50 cent movies it was pretty packed. Hidalgo wasn't though, which is a good thing.  I liked it, the only part I didn't like was the shooting at wounded knee.  Killing people in war is one thing, but killing helpless people is a massacre. That is defenintly wrong.  Hidalgo was good, but the Last Samurai is better.  They're not really in the same genre, so I can't effectively compare them.  Out of the two I liked the Last Samurai better. Maybe it's because it is a war movie.  I always liked those..go figure.  One thing that seriously annoys me is that great lack of tactics and strategy from the Samurai at the last battle. If they had   just  used a slight bit of tactics, they could have inflicted alot more damage, and sustained alot less casualties.  If they had positioned archers on either side of that small road the soldiers had to come down, they could have inflicted ALOT more casualties.  If they had used those pitch package deals, they could have burned more men, and if they hadn't LINED UP TO BE SHOT BY THE HOWITZERS they wouldn't have been hurt so bad in the first place. Hello?! Let's line up for the howitzers shall we?  I know they needed to stage a retreat and all, but stick a smaller force in there. Anyways, that's how that goes with me.  Time to go pick up some much needed supplies. Chaio!
I think Xanga might be better than blog.  But blog does force you to do the html yourself, as opposed to xanga which does it all for you.  So really here you get a learning experience. So i'm taking a poll to see which one you think is better.  Just put it in the comments section, xanga or blog? Which one do   you  think is the best? The whole talk show host voice doesn't do anything for me.
I played volley ball today at our church picnic.  First time i've really played.  I was the underdog... really underdog..i had some good moves.  Then there are my other moves, that really stank.  Thus underdog.  I'll get it though.  Only lost three out of eight games. Wasn't to bad. I played for 3 hours! On that note, it wasn't bad at all. Today my family and I went to mazzio's to eat pizza (oh, who 'da thought?) and cake.  We had to get our own cake, but we were going to have to get a regular sized cake for $17. But a guy from our church (who was also getting a cake for his dad's birthday) found the same kind of cake, and we could get two for $14.  Nice deal.  So we got that,(ryan and I) and we got frappachinos with the leftover money :-) On to mazzio's we went!  There we watched tennis, and european football...and made fun of french and german people.  I also had a trick played on me which is to close for me to talk about right now (it cut me deep ;-) ) and i messed up someone's fun by making the language portugeuse...yah.. Anyways... I went to a different church with my family this morning, it was a good sermon, and the people are very nice.  The old people anyway, the youth, i think, are all mute.  Time, once again, is not on my side so i'll leave you with this....Zzzzzz
I wake up, go into my bathroom to brush my teeth, right?  I get the tube and squeeze it, and out comes this big bubble.  My toothpaste is green (no, it's not shrek toothpaste, it's just to show you how well it cleans...i guess) so that added to it. I know that toothpaste is a cleaner and all that, but still. Anyways, time limits me, so I'll check in later.
If anybody knows how to put links on this, it'd really be great if you could AIM me at Pharsalus8948 or just leave a comment on how to do it.                                 It's really annoying....
Dad's Home! Oh yah, he just got home from Dallas and he'll be here all weekend! He has to work there which really stinks. Anyways, it's getting late(not by some people's clocks) and I'd better go to sleep. Chaio!
Here I am, watching over the little ones.  My dad gets home later tonight from Dallas, Woohoo! I should probably clean up the kitchen a bit. It could use some cleaning.. I could always use my power and enforce slave labor. The title TASKMASTER doesn't seem to bad. Well, time to go check on them. Away i go.
Ok, this is mainly a test, so if I say something on here, it most likely has nothing to do with anything.  So that pretty much rules out any relativity. Once again this is a test.
I've just returned from seeing King Arthur with my cousin and my brother.&nbsp; It was alright; I'll give it a 50 cent movie rating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some language,&nbsp; some scenes that you could go without,&nbsp; but the violence as one would expect in a movie like this wasn't to&nbsp;bad.&nbsp; This contradicts with my cousin's opinion, but then again, that's why it is called an oppinion.&nbsp; It rarley actually showed the expendable crewman getting stabbed or anything like that.&nbsp; Blood was occasional, and this one part where Arthur has to pop somebody's fingers back into socket looks painful.&nbsp; Kind of like the feeling you get when someone scratches their fingernails on a blackboard....yeah, like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Theatres don't come in the best ways possible in my city...we have two fairly good ones. The Cinemark, and the AMC. The AMC tends to be expensive though, and it's not on my side of town.&nbsp; The starworld, which is the one we used, is ok but i wouldn't give it an award for....something like...seat cushioning...or backlighting wonders....or stuff like that.&nbsp; Time keeps going while I type, and I need to get up early this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Out for now...
I have just returned from swim team practice. I feel like a pansy. Then again, the other people (6 other girls varying age, the youngest of which is around 12 and the oldest must be around 16) have been for a few years probably. Or at least many months. We swam for one hour straight. Sprinting. Ah, very fun; I could barely keep up in the first sprints. In the warm-up we swam an easy 5 minute freestyle..I did better in that. Heh, that's pretty sad saying that I did better in the warm-up. Immediatly following this, we did more sprints, sets of 50 yards. I did alright. I was in the first group to go, and the last to come back predictably enough. Suffice to say, this happened about everytime. I did in fact, eat every one elses bubbles. ;-) I have not yet perfected my flip-turn, so I was slow in turning, I haven't perfected any of my strokes, thus increasing my water resistance and decreasing my speed, and increasing my chances of getting tired faster. Anyone with any tips? I think I just need practice. This is only my fourth day to swim, so I'm doing alright. Now that I'm home, I need to mow in about an hour or two...the smell of freshly cut grass. In the meantime, however, I can eat and take a nap or something. Out for now.
I hadn't been to there in ages, but some friends from out of town came and I also hadn't seen them in ages so they canceled each other out and we went there. I had the big chicken all you can eat thing, but i didn't have anything for breakfast so the rfried beans didn't taste all too apetizing. During the middle of the meal the electricity blinked and of course Genny's(friend from texas) little sister(obviously little sister of friend from texas...and she also lives in texas..go figure) decided to scream a bit along with some other friend's son who is only three. After we sort of ate the food, Genny's drink was taken away by the waitress so she could get a refill. However, we believe that the waitress either didn't like us because we insulted the food, or the syrup had drained down to the bottom of the drink. Either way, it tasted nasty. Following that episode we decided to  go and see if we could try our luck at the arcade.  However...we need money. One of us obtains a large bill (not to large) and puts it all into tokens. I being the only one with pockets large enough to hold 108 tokens was left with the majority of the bounty. I'm likin' this, a cargo pocket full of tokens i didn't even pay for, and ski ball and cruising the usa at my fingertips. Muhaha! I exercised my will power however, and shared the tokens that weren't even mine. We watch the little ones while at the same time ski-balling and racing. This is great. Ahh! now the storms. We had great storms with some nice thunder. The little ones have now scattered so Genny and I go on a racing spree. She testifies that she won most of the time, but I, being the male, flatly deny that claim. I had the coolest crashes anyway. And I beat her plenty of times. Anyways...We probably blew around 25 tokens on that alone. And we raced for probably half an hour. We did all the courses. And two different cars. The humvee and the jeep. Cause all the other cars are wimpy. My little brother accidentally chose manual, that was fun. I had to dodge and maneuver five car pile ups and big trees (even tho you could run over them anyway) with one hand while shifting. That's talent. Did some more ski ball, and then we had a very small number of tokens left. Genny and I raced once again and i won once and she won once. This one kid got boochoos of tickets in some gambling game. He must have gotten 250 tickets. With no tokens and with nothing else to do, we had to get creative. In this case, it had great potential. You see, My friend's little sister (see above) had a little toy frog that was perfect for shooting at people. So Genny and her cousin becky plotted to shoot me with it, but she couldn't figure out how to do it so there plans were shattered. So much for that....the Guatamalan assassin will need to devise something new. I also revealed the fact that one of my siblings is deathly afraid of rubber bands. All I had to do was act like i had a rubber band by holding two fingers by each other and he shrank into a corner. Amazing. Having nothing to do, and being creative as we are, we decided to go back to the tables to avoid doing something that the staff wouldn't approve of, and because there were no chairs. Once we got there though, our parents stood up and left, and we went with them. The rain was still raining, so Genny went to get her car...danger..i could feel it begin to reek in the air the moment she put her foot on the gas pedal. I jumped onto the median on the way to my car, but i still didn't fell safe. She has a 2 ton weapon, and a curb won't do me much good. She actually drove very well considering that she almost couldn't see over the steering wheel...heh, sorry, i couldn't resist. Then they drove away and we drove away...and then i made political campaign signs for the next two and a half hours. Sitting...in the same room...making signs. Ah well, at least I had a better note for the day, and that would be my visit to Casa Bonita. Ciao
I've joined the swim team. Very cool. I went to get evaluated and all that fun stuff on Tuesday; I got my ID card for the ymca (the team I'm at for the moment, might join bixby) and i got really tired. I was on my way to a friend's house to go hang out, but then I realized that we had to be at the Y in 20 minutes. That kind of stank, but it turned out okay. When I first got there, I had to swim freestyle for 5 minutes. I'm sure that's not hard for people that swim, but I haven't done any swimming like that in a year or two. I finish up and I'm pretty tired. Now they want me to just flutter kick down and back. I get critiqued and try again, and I have it down pretty good. Now for the freestlye drills. I need to work on my 1)Alternate breathing 2) Arm strokes 3) Not getting tired. After that I did the breaststroke, and the coach said I was really good at that. It's my favorite stroke because you're underwater for the majority of the stroke. The coach said that my leg\kicking was great, but my arms stank. I was given yet again more pointers (i needed them) and was sent down to the other end of the pool. My pointers, and back I went again. She said that it was almost perfect right then, but I know that I still need to work on it alot...not to mention endurance. I did the backstroke and some other drills, and some push off and and starting techniques. After all this, I got out, and got dressed and all, though I'm still wet and my shirt is soaked from the bottom to about 5 inches above that. In order to get my card I need to get my picture taken. Nice. I get my picture taken and lucky for me it wasn't zoomed to much. Chlorine takes it out of ya. Time to go and take a shower. I'm all chlorined out. Ciao!
I think I've figured out how to leave out the title. This isn't about any specific item, so I can't really give it a title. This portion of this particular blog should be called 'Attic adeu' or some other cheesy alliteration like that. See, I don't get to sleep until twelve this morning (woah, now it's tomrrow again, must be a growing trend or something) and then I was woken up by a sweet storm. However a lamp was on and I had to turn that off. So I have this totally sweet storm with thunder and lightning and all that other stuff, and I'm to tired to watch it. Then i'm woken up yet again. I'm thinking that it has to be pretty early because my mind is still asleep and my body is kind of getting up, but not really moving, then laying back down. Come to find out it is 8 o'clock. Ugh. I creak out of bed, and I am hustled around the house by little siblings telling me that I am wanted outside. So I go outside and lo and behold the grass is wet. That's ok though, I don't really mind. I find out we are going to mount a satellite dish on the side of our house. Joy. We mount the sattelite on the side of our house with little difficulty, but now we must feed it through the attic into the house. So who gets to go up into the actual bowels of the house and fiberglass? Me. That's ok though, i wanted to go. Here is the cool part, we have this ball that is attatched to the end of a rope kind of thing, and we tied that to another rope, and then i went up into the attic and threw it down to another part of the attic where the cable was. This was my idea by the way...very genius. kind of. Now it is getting pretty hot. It got up to around 95 degrees. So now I plug in the cable to the jack and i come down. Totally awesome view, you can see the skeleton of the house. However, as I said, it is really hot right now. Quickly following after that, I come down, and it does not work. So, we unplug the cable and string down through the house. Now it works because it is the actual cable itself coming straight from the satellite to the reciever. That's nice and all, but we want it to work coming throug the cable jack up in the attic. So again, I go up into the attic and plug in the cable. Now, again it does not work. So again we pull it down through the house. And that's the way we've had to leave it. So perhaps if you know why this might be happening, just leave a comment...or follow the popular trend right now and know what could fix it and don't say anything. Out for now. Ciao
I've officially seen all the spider man movies more than two times each. Yes, they're that good. If you haven't seen it yet it is defenintly worth the 5 dollars. (If you're a student) I would like to put down some of the funny lines, but I think that would spoil the movie. All the times I've seen it have been after 9:00....pm. So that means I keep getting home rather late. That's ok however, because I've developed a tendency to sleep in whenever a situation like that occurs. So, I'm alright. Not that it is a special tendency, but it helps. Now I'm hungry. So if you have any spare time and money send me a giant calzone or something like that....and some pie too. That'd be really nice. Probably going to bike in the rain. Interesting feeling that, but you should try it.
At the moment, I have a dog in my lap. Go figure. Anyways, Not much going on here except school starts in a few days....joy! No, seriously. ;-) At the moment I am also listening to George Winston Jam out on the piano.  Linus and Lucy all the way. He is also crazy good....except on a piano. In case any of you kind hearted people out there want to randomly give me some money, I would rather have the Korg SP-500. Or even better the Triton Extreme. Also Korg. So, anytime now. I'm out, I need to read a certain other blog, then I need to do assorted variety packet special deals....of sorts. C'ya
Woah, he is crazy good on a guitar. Anyway you want it, he can play it better than anyone else.  I don't fully attribute that to him, because I know God has really blessed him with that talent.  Totally amazing, You can do anything with Christ who strengthens you.  That really shows because he only has 9 fingers. And he jams like nobody's business.
I just played a really cool song on the piano. No music, no chords on purpose, just let my fingers down and off the went. It was a slow sort jazz blues song.  Most of the chords had either a flat or sharp on the 3 and 5 fingers, and a natural on the 1. Kinda cool.  I eventually harnessed it and put it in C and ended both hands on a C Major.  It was cool because i played it and it sound kind of cool, but it was also a bit mushed together and from a technical standpoint it wasn't very good.  Someone who is better than me would probably have smiled and said, 'Yeah, that's good.' and pat me on the shoulder all the while having this condescending 'I know something you don't know' smile and think the same thing.  Ah well, it will come with technic and practice.  Until next entry                                                   Shonan
It takes a bit to earn that.  I still have a bit of my bit to go...a big bit.  Practice and time.  And theory unfortunatnley. Theory on chords. I just need to learn to jam.  I can read music, i have a good ear for piano, but i can't seem to jam at all. It's bugging me on a metaphorical level.  It will come. I'll make it come.  Hehe, i'll make it come in  bit. In the meantime I'll be practicing Maple Leaf Rag.  Very cool song; right now i'm on the second page. Woohoo!  The first page needs some dynamics, and a bit more fluidity, but besides that it's totally done.  All I need on the fourth page is the notes, speed, rythym, and dynamics. So i'm pretty much all set there.  If I could get one a day....Wouldn't that be nice.  And if I could learn to jam in one key each week! Man, i'd be a serious prodigy. That's not what I am so dilligence comes into play.                My older brother was greatly privileged last night because he heard  Don Ryan  in concert with a jazz band. Plus played Linus and Lucy.  With the extremely crazy hard and cool jazz part.  Ack.  I'm next. If I could pick three people to see in concert, it wouldn't be some rock band or anything, it'd have to be people with major skill.  So Phil Keaggy, Don Ryan...and....either an edited version of Dave Matthews. (No, i do not listen to any of his songs that i've heard have language in it.)  Or maybe James Taylor.  I wouldn't want to hear Harry Connick junior, cause i saw him performing once on some tv channel; banging some chords out that didn't really sound good and acting like it was pretty much all about him.  Poser.  If you disagree, comment on my blog so i can delete it.  Time to go practice some more or listen to Maple Leaf Rag so I can practice it. Ciao
So it begins.  Yesterday I had to organize my desk and get all my notebooks labeled.  I get to work at home, see? But don't think it's easy and I get to slack off all day cause i don't....all you anti homeschool people. Plus we have harder stuff at an earlier age. The US really needs to work on their school systems. Ah well, maybe later.  Today I get to label more notebooks.  Joyousness! Plus tomorrow I get to get up at 8:30 in preperation for getting up at 7:00. Not that early, but that doesn't really matter right now.  On the upside of all this, I don't fully start school until the 30th.  So I'll have plenty of time to practice Maple Leaf Rag. Now it's time for something a bit more exciting than sitting here and typing. Ciao
Hey, it's been a bit. Wow, King Arthur was the last entry. Ok time to update some.  A few things have happened in that time space.  One of the most important is that I've obtained  the  actual sheet music for  the  actual Maple Leaf Rag. Interesting name: yes.  Awesome skill requirement and totally rewarding song: yes. So it evens itself out.  In fact, i'm listening to a clip of that song right now.  Absolutley amazing.  Also in that time space was the action packed Friday. I had a birthday party I had to go to, and immideatly after that some of my friends had a gig at a coffee shop. The well known Kaffe Bona.  I took a ride with a friend (Some call him.....tim?) and not only was he conveniently going to the birthday party right after practicing for the gig at my house, but he was also playing at the gig after the birthday party, so getting a ride wasn't an obstacle.  After the birthday party which conveniently provided dinner, i didn't even plan to eat anything and I still got food, we played poker and did the whole present thing....except i forgot mine...but that will change soon. I played some piano and was out the door to walmart.  Tim's fingers were pretty much eaten away the by the guitar strings, so we needed superglue so his fingers wouldn't hurt and he could solo.  Off to walmart, off to....which aisle would superglue be in? Tim thought that the aisle with medical supplies would work, cause if you get a cut you need something that will stay on it right? I told him that the rest of the civilized world used band-aids...except for his neighbor , then told him that we needed to go through teacher supplies.  So we did, and in the middle of his sentence about why woud someone put superglue in the teacher supplies there it was. Score.  Got the glue now on to the cash register! We found an empty express lane, but the guy had to go find a ten dollar bill for change, so we ended up waiting for around three minutes.  Once we were in the car, we had to maneuvre through the parking lot full of medians. Kaffe Bona was packed. It's a relatively small place to begin with, but with this many people (they raked in quite the audience...and money for Kaffe Bona coffee) it was rather stuffy. First, there was a group playing ahead of us.  They were going to play for about 15 minutes, then the  real  show would begin.  It was horrid.  I mean, really horrid. I had to tell my friends that were there to dismiss the first group because Ryan's group was nothing like this.  Just to give you an idea of how deranged they were, first you couldn't hear the girl on vocals, second the guitarist was repetitive, third the third guy had a 20 key keyboard he kept trying to make weird sounds off of, and was throwing light bulbs into a box so they would break and make noise. He did this repeatedly with three lightbulbs, a cell phone, then finally dropped the entire box of lightbulbs.  However this missed the box and hit the floor because he wasn't looking where he was dropping, but was smiling at the crowd.  Not only that, be he had the oddest 'hat.' It looked like an oversized, confused pop corn kernel gone wrong.  And it was brown.  A second song they played was even worse...if that's possible.  The guitarist was playing, and the third guy was was running a power drill next to the pick-up just to make noise. Really hideous.  Then Something else started playing....yeah, that's the name of Ryan's band.  So when you're in the car and someone says ,' Dude, put something else on.'  You'll know what to do.  Yeah, i thought it was cheesy too, i had the great name of Acoustic Cappuchino, but no.  Anyway, throught that time i listened, talked, and surfed the web. Cause it's an internet cafe as well.  Some people from the birthday came too, because we invited them and Tim and I know just about all of them...which is why we were there... All in all, it was a good jam. We packed up, got some free stuff since I was with the band, and went home.             So that is the account of that Friday...i'll come back and post a bit later with the rest.
My first year as an attorney has had its ups and downs.  I guess that is to be expected, but the ups are certainly more fun than the downs.  Of course, the first and most important up was the raise I received upon passing the bar exam.  The first down was being threatened with Rule 11 sanctions, but that worked itself out and was simply the result of an older attorney from a big firm trying to bluff the new kid in the small firm.      In the beginning there was very little change in what I did as a law clerk and what I do as an attorney, the main difference being that I could finally sign my own name to my work.  I still ran to my higher ups for approval before filing anything, but over the last few months, I have actually been generating business.  Now that I have my own clients and my own caseload, it's much easier to pick something up and run with it than it was when other attorneys' clients were on the line.      I've done quite a few depositions and a few hearings.  Working in the firm that I'm in, I get to do a little bit of every kind of law, plaintiff and defense work, personal injury, class actions, insurance claims and defenses, EEOC claims, Workers' Comp claims, Social Security, the occasional divorce, etc.   At least, things rarely get boring.   The down side to that is there's alot of research involved due to the fact that we work with so many different types of cases, and many many briefs to be written.    As far as my personal life goes, I've finally given in and bought a house of my own.  It's nice to know that for once in my life, I don't have to worry about how I'm going to make the payments on things.  Of course, it's all my responsibility now too.  That was a little scary at first, but I guess that's just part of being a member of the real world instead of just a student.      Between the new responsibilities at work and the new responsibilities at home, things get a little stressful sometimes.  On the up side though, we've got two new law clerks at work and I've been given full permission to make use of them.  Oh the joys of inflicting terror into the hearts of the young and gullible.  It's my turn now to have the clerks cowering before my verbal abuse and unrealistic demands.  I learned well from the associate I worked under.  Seriously, I love my law clerks and I wouldn't dream of being mean to them.  The worst thing I've ever done is refer to their office as the day care center and the office manager as their babysitter.
Life has suddenly become hectic.  The title of this post is so accurate.  I've suddenly become booked for depositions, hearings, meetings, and so on that were not expected.  I truly hate going into a deposition on an hour's notice and not knowing a thing in the world about the case.  It doesn't help that the other associate in the office is causing us great worry.  He looks like he may have a breakdown soon.  I sincerely hope not because if he does, I won't be far behind.  School has started back, so our law clerks have returned to class and left us to fend for ourselves.  I kind of miss them.  They at least gave me something to smile about, not to mention that they certainly improved the view around the place.  That also means that my kids have gone back to school also.  In case I haven't mentioned it, I've got four kids, ages 12, 11, 9, and 7.  Boy, girl, girl, and boy.  The boys live with their dad during the school year and the girls live with me, so I do have a little help with them.  You would think that my life would be easier with them at school, but I leave for work about the time they go to school and I get back after they're home.  Now, I've got homework to deal with as well as getting them fed, bathed, and in bed before midnight.  Guitar lessons also started back for my 9 year old.  She is convinced that she's going to be a rock star when she grows up.  I must admit, she's gotten pretty good at playing Yankee Doodle.  She thinks she's ready to start playing Skynard riffs though.  More power to her.  She's still undecided if she wants to be a rock star, a lawyer, or a teacher--or maybe all three.  The older one wants to be a fashion designer.  She's a little too girly for my tastes, but hey, she is a girl after all.  I must admit that I don't agree with her on alot of things.  For example, we had a debate last week over a crown.  She ordered a bunch of crowns, tiaras, etc. from a catalog and she did not think it was appropriate for me to wear the king's crown because I was a girl.  I don't think I ever did convince her that the simple fact that I was female did not prohibit me from being king if I wanted to be.  I guess, to be technical, the definition of king does include male, but nothing says it has to be that way.  Hmmph.  I am doing one girly thing lately though.  I'm learning to cook.  I don't mean throwing something in the microwave and heating it up, which is my normal routine, but really cooking.  You know, with the use of a stove and recipes and stuff.  It's pretty cool.  I'm really into baking, but even though I follow the recipe, the mixtures I concoct generally end up being runnier than they're supposed to be.  Tip of the day:  When baking teacakes (aka cookie-like substinence) and the recipe calls for you to roll the dough out and cut the cakes before placing on the pan, do it.  Otherwise you end up with a huge pan of run-together cookie/cake mess that is rather unattractive.  Of course, in that situation, you're in luck whether your guests like cookies or cake.  You can throw one on a plate and call it whatever you like.
One thing that young attorneys should realize is that your life is not going to be all big exciting trials and intense negotiations, at least not at first. I have been lucky enough to work on a couple of those big exciting trials and even helped pick the jury for one -- my home town. Work for newbies is likely to mean lots of research, attending hearings on trivial matters (ie petitioning the court to approve a settlement agreement or to withdraw funds from a guardianship), sitting in on long and boring depositions, and my favorite (So Not!), collections.  That was a rather accurate description of my last week and a half. I am sick of harassing poor people with no money and ordering them to pay my clients. The hearings are okay. They get me out of the office and into the court room at least. The depositions though, that is an entirely different story. I sat in for a day on some of the most boring depositions ever. Of course, I've sat in on several of the depos in this same case before (there's only about 30 plaintiffs and they all have to be deposed) so I already know all the questions and most of the answers. That day had its moments though.  By the last deposition (around 6:00 pm), the deposing attorney was so tired that when he asked the deponent (a cute little blonde twenty-year-old) about her physical health, he just blurted out, 'Do you have any diseases?' Hilarious.  One of the other deponents was in the National Guard during integration and spent twenty-nine days on the Ole Miss campus when James Meridith started there. Now, the law school at Ole Miss has a memorial to James Meredith. Times have certainly changed over the last forty or fifty years. Thank God!      I guess there is an upside to all of this though.  Our chief partner just got back from Panama and has gone to Denver, and our three-year associate just got back from Europe and is going to Maui next week.  One day...
I found the quote 'Death is more universal than life; everyone dies, but not everyone lives'. This is true. Thinking about death is not being pessimistic. Death is a part of our lives (verbal irony...haha). It meets us in the beginning, middle, or end. But once again, we find death cannot exist without life. Life comes first, and Death comes later. Does this mean life is of more importance? More powerful? Does it mean Life = Good, Death = Evil? We have been conditioned to think so. Conditioned, or born with those ideals? Is it something automatically programmed into our brains before we are born? Or is it something we are taught to think by ourselves? Then again, some are born dead. Death inflirtrates a woman's womb. Everything is balanced for a reason but what reason? Death vs. Life, Rich vs. Poor, Good vs. Evil, Heaven vs. Hell. None can exist without it's counterpart, because without the counterpart we wouldn't have much diversity in our opinions, now would we? We would have no right or wrong. It's a cycle. The simplest of things are the hardest to understand. So simple that it enables us to create twisted versions of it and accept it for the truth when the original concept has all the answers.   Yes, that was really random....haha....   DEATH is stronger than all the governments because the governments are men and men die and then death laughs: Now you see âem, now you donât.   DEATH is stronger than all proud men and so death snips proud men on the nose, throws a pair of dice and says: Read âem and weep.   DEATH sends a radiogram every day: When I want you Iâll drop inâand then one day he comes with a master-key and lets himself in and says: Weâll go now.   DEATH is a nurse mother with big arms: âTwonât hurt you at all; itâs your time now; you just need a long sleep, child; what have you had anyhow better than sleep?
Well nothing happened today, I'm not surprised. I feel useless, my mother is constantly bitching at me so I get frustrated and i'm like 'fuck it'.      It's so hard to not make my life sound like the one of another stupid teenager with depression. What I have isn't teen angst or  'oh god i hate the fucking world and i want to rip everyone's flesh into tiny little shreads and see them bleed as i tear them apart and hear them scream as i rip out their heart and hang them from the ceiling by their intestines.'  No, I don't think like that. Nor do I want to grab a knife and slash my wrists so that I can carry out some fucked up suicide attempt and have people feeling sorry for me.      Everything is so stereotypical these days.  There are smaller margins on what it is to be original.  People classify you no matter what you do.       1. Oh you dress in all black and have a pasty ass complexion, you must be a 'Goth!' or...    2. wow, you have different color shoes, checkered pants, a shirt that doesn't match, and funky ass hair you must be a 'punk!'...     3. then the classic (and yes, i hate it) khakis, with flip flops, a tight ass Abercrombie & Fitch shirt, with one of those surfer necklaces and spiky hair....oh no you're a 'prep!'        (but then again, everywhere i go i see these guys dressed like that with some blond girl at their side dressed in the female version of this so called 'fashion'. so i don't see it as original whatsoever. Paying $60 for some of those clothes Abercrombie sells, is seriously a crime)        You get labelled for trying to be original to some extent.      Some, well no,  most people think the Gothic culture is a 'music culture' . They think they are these weird satanical people that have an obession with death and will murder you if you get in their way. Personally, I haven't really gotten around to asking them why they dress that way but the basic overview is that it's not a music culture.   Back in the day people didn't have dyes for clothes so everyone had black or grey clothing. Goth is a type of architecture. The Visigoths existed in Germany. There are so many things that Goth pertains to, yet  we don't know anything below what we see.      Sure, most of them are what we call 'posers' who try to stand out by giving you muderous looks so that you'll leave them alone and be intimidated by them.      Then we typically  associate punks with the self mutilators  that go around with short sleeves so they can show the world their self inflicted wounds. Once again, most of the people I see at my school like that have kitten scratch 'wounds'. If you fucking wanted to kill yourself go slit your wrists nice and deep and don't show anyone!!  Why else would you go around showing everyone things like that? Oh,  I'm depressed and be afraid of me because i'm not afraid to carve out my veins!  Hmm....all I have to say is REAL PUNK IS DEAD. I don't blame them for wanting to dress like that BUT when it's obvious you are doing it for show more than hardcore addiction, watch out, you could get bashed!!!  (sense the sarcasm in that people)     On my part, that's a criticism, but don't blame me. I write what I see.     We purposely try to be someone we aren't to get a form of respect and fear. Power.     We also fear what we don't understand.  (damn that sounds so clichÃ© but it's true) Get to know some of these people and see what they are really like.  In school I hear the 'preps' making fun of the 'goths and punks' because they're 'freaks' and they are 'gay'. I know none of them have ever gotten to know each other but we make assumptions on what somebody is like simply because of what we label them as. Every category has a default personality description and we think that's all we need to know.      Prep = bitchy, rich, white, ditzy, disrespectful, racist    Goth = depressed, weird, stupid, death obsessed, love black clothing, satan worshippers    Punk = freaks, stupid, posers, none of their clothes match     We automatically think these things, but once we get to know them, they are very different.   But in a society where we are force fed ideologies on these things, we discriminate.         I constantly think about things like that. Once you get to know me you'll be surprised at what goes on in my head. That is probably one of the reasons why I don't talk about these types of things with people my age. Most don't understand. Most of them are concerned with trivial things.    We waste our time debating over what brand of toilet paper to buy, what toothpaste to use, what brand of tissue paper we need to clean our snot with  (and it's not like the bugs in the trash can are like 'Dude! this is Puffs! not shitty Kleenex!!').   Capitalism!!!!    Don't ask how this all stemmed from talking about my boring old day. I'll continue some other day....now  a thought on DEATH.                   M  EN   fear death, as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other. Certainly, the contemplation of death, as the wages of sin and passage to another world, is holy and religious; but the fear of it,   as a tribute due unto nature, is weak.
Hello lovely people......    How are you all on this perfectly desolate but glorious morning/afternoon/evening?    I cut myself, so now i'm trying to stop my hand from bleeding so err...profusely. When blood mixes with water it looks like Kool-Aid....haha, movie blood! Hmm...yeah, blood is interesting to study. No, not just because of my semi-obsession with vampires (b00!), and no not because my favorite color is red. *evil smile*     Well, since i woke up about an hour ago, there haven't been sufficient 'events' to write an entry about my day so far.    This summer has been really strange. It rains for days at a time, then we get one sunny day, and then it's cold for days after that. This is something i wrote about the seasons. Each stanza is a different season (not that hard to figure out). Stanzas 2 and 4 are only written using words to express what you smell or hear. Have fun.....i'll write more later on.
Well i've been busy with band practice for the past two days. We have a new marching style this year and it's a hard bitch to learn. I'm kinda excited for band camp actually, the music isn't as bad as i thought it would be. It's a circus jazz style, very cool. I hope the n00bs don't fuck it up, they aren't bad but the drumline isn't half as good as it was last year. Dan and Jarell are going on a European tour for Student Ambassadors. I got invited last year but for certain reasons that cannot be named here, I had to turn it down. =(     I'm not too thrilled about band practices (the bugs are one of the reasons), I don't have a lot of friends there, I just noticed that. Jen left for Grandville, and Toni moved back to Philadelphia, and now she's moving to Vancouver, Washington. =( People show such indifference towards me. I have been friends with some of them since I was 11 and then they just walk by me without even saying 'hi' or 'how have you been?'.     I could tell you about each of them, what they do, what they are like, etc. That's why sometimes I'm so quiet, I analyze people without ever talking to them. I see their actions, their reactions, their choices, how they choose their words, how they choose their friends. It's amazing how much you can learn from being an outsider.     I considered quitting the band at some point because to me, the music is just as important as the people you play it with. You don't play as an individual, you play as one, one sound -- one heart. When you know the person sitting next to you despises you, it's hard to enjoy the music and give it everything you have. I don't think I have ever given anyone a reason to dislike me, but it happens. I hate it, because I consider those people my friends yet to them, I'm an enemy. Then again I have never been one to go and make random friends, it's so much easier online, hehe, don't you agree?    I was looking through my old school stuff today, my mom has all my report cards, progress reports, awards, letters, sincr I was in kindergarten in New Jersey. It was weird. I even found my certificate that says i don't have to take the ESL (English as a Second Language) course anymore. How ironic, haha. I speak english so well now. =P I found a lot of things that belonged to my younger brother (the one i haven't seen in years), it made me sad. Well, that's all for now...c ya later people
&nbsp;     Obscure Pictures     &nbsp;  Walking underneath blue skies,  and on top of unknown lands beneath.  A secluded patch of barren land fills my sight,  a land, with hidden secrets below.  Individual mysteries of the ages,  unbeknownst to you and I.  I walk into it; into another realm,  of deadly tranquility.  Pillars of truth and lies,  successes and failures,  and forgotten controversy,  as they fill the night.  &nbsp;  Opaque colors and granite stone,  of monumental and diminutive size  swarm around me.  Words inscribed in stone,  smooth and worn with age.  Others have just joined the family,  fresh and coarse words  accompany the eerie smell  of freshly turned soil.  &nbsp;  Wearing your identity on your sleeve,  proclaiming who you were,  and who you arenât anymore.  Beneath your tag, you are never seen,  for what you are.  Encased in wood, and comforted by satin,  what is left of you rests,  forever, in a tormented state of peace.  Brittle bones that have turned to ash,  and ceased to exist.  Dead in my world,  reborn in yours.  &nbsp;  Your bare identity reveals nothing more of you.  Six feet under you lay, in a cold, desolate world,  expressed into insanity, where you will never be.  The earth you used to tread on is no longer the same,  a family you once knew has moved on, and left you behind.  Gone into the great beyond.  &nbsp;  There you are,  perpetually sleeping, in a comatose state,  of sub-consciousness.  Numb to the world around you, that was your only purpose.  Memories and dreams,  have soaked into the ground beneath.  Losing part of you, and gaining nothing from me.  -Written by...myself
'Intelligence is an extremely subtle concept. It's a kind of  understanding that flourishes if it's combined with a good memory, but  exists anyway even in the absence of good memory. It's the ability to  draw consequences from causes, to make correct inferences, to foresee  what might be the result, to work out logical problems, to be  reasonable, rational, to have the ability to understand the solution  from perhaps insufficient information. You know when a person is  intelligent, but you can be easily fooled if you are not yourself  intelligent.'   --Isaac Asimov
Time goes by so fast. Everyday is spent in the same manner. Going around, doing nothing in particular, just wasting time.   Time, I believe, is one of those things that has no real definition. Time isn't constant as we believe it to be. I've always seen two ways to the beginning of everything. Creation and Evolution. Creation being the religious perspective and evolution being just that, evolving from  lesser creatures into what we are now.   Some say that God created space and time. But when asked: 'So what was God doing before he created time [and the universe]? You don't reply: 'He was preparing Hell for people who asked such questions'. I don't believe God created the universe, or time for that matter. When someone asks how did life begin on this Earth most go on to explain how God created us, etc etc etc taking the path of creation. Explaining it through the area of evolution is trickier but more plausible in some ways. Since there are loads of different religions not everyone accepts God created us. Science on the other hand is fact, and therefore it has more reason to be believed.   Hmmm...those thoughts bring me to the subject of time travel! hahaha....it'd be cool to actually travel back in time. It's said that traveling into the future doesn't break any laws of nature but traveling into the past does. Hehe, imagine History becoming experimental. History is one of the only things we, at the present time, cannot alter. This also brings the question of the grandfather paradox. If you went back in time and murdered your grandfather, would you still exist? Or would you just pop out of existence in the future? When you kill your grandfather maybe time or something else will intervene and cause him to bend down and tie his shoe at the time you decide to put a bullet in him. Time itself would intervene in the series of events you would cause that alters the entire course of the future. Scary thought. Hmmm..ok enough of that for now...  I just read an interesting poem today called 'Repression of War Experience' by Siegfried Sassoon....  Now light the candles; one; two; thereâs a moth;  What silly beggars they are to blunder in  And scorch their wings with glory, liquid flameâ  No, no, not that,âitâs bad to think of war,  When thoughts youâve gagged all day come back to scare you; And itâs been proved that soldiers donât go mad  Unless they lose control of ugly thoughts...  hmm...that's only the first stanza, it's a good poem, it made me think a lot  Well that's all for the daily rants.....g'nite!
I went to the psychologist this morning, it was weird. I don't like this new psychologist very much. I liked my old one better. This one has a funny way of looking at me, like she expects I'll snap at any moment. gahhh...i don't think those sessions are doing me any good.  I keep procrastinating!! My room still looks like shit, and I need to start doing my homework. Sander already finished reading the Hobbit + all the million questions last night....as for me...i'm on the first paragraph. Sander and I have a habit of running into each other, I saw her and her sister Linda at the library today (haven't been there in ages, I hope they forgot I owe like $17 in fines).   Band training on Monday! Yayness...there goes my summer. I'm kinda excited, kinda not. I wanna go tomorrow to the freshmen camp to help out with newbies. Volunteer Dey. Scary thought.  I walked outside today and I saw the frog my brother killed last night. It hasn't started decomposing yet, I know that nobody will clean it up because it blends in with the dirt so I'll watch it decompose everyday. That's a much better lesson on the  post mortem  process than what froguts.com could teach me.   Hmmm...new topic on the subject of the universe....I don't understand gamma ray blasts. Eh, maybe that will be the cause for the end of the universe. Too bad our lives are so short, we'll never find out everything we want to know.
Well in response to Chris' response....things I consider  essential  if I went to the moon...   1.  My computer. Hell, all my songs are on there so i figured i might as well bring that instead of just a cd/mp3 player  2.  CLOTHES. The must have. Fave umm...everything...(wonders what Chris' fave boxers have on them, they better not be silk otherwise i'll think stuff)  3.  My clone! Can't live with him or without him!
Today was boring...and my room is a mess, i need to do some major cleaning. I have to sweep up dead bugs and clean the spiderwebs around here.   We had thunderstorms today, it was great. The sky was bright as day till about 10PM. It was different shades of purple, pink, yellow, green, blue and black, I took some pictures. I loved it, the feeling the light cast on the ground was creepy.  I found a frog outside and my brother threw a rock on top of it. Small frog, big rock = guts out of the frog's mouth. Poor frog, I felt bad about it.  I'm having another one of my sad spells....just a feeling of loving myself/disliking myself. I always have the feeling that my life is just one big lie. No stability in it at all. I don't even feel like writing anymore because everything turns out the same, another pessimistic piece of crap that people think is great. Gah, I hate reading what I write, it's a load of bullshit to me at times, but it's true. Many of us don't have happy things to write about or uplifting things to make you feel better. In some ways it's easier to write about sad things or dark things, probably because we all associate with it more at this point in our lives. 'Teen Angst' ha! what a load of crap! I don't like that term...so stereotypical. I don't concern myself with trivial things. What i worry about most is what will become of me. If you know my circumstances you can figure it out, if you don't, well maybe i'll tell you later on....
Did you ever consider milk to be cow piss?    In a way it is....  [Thought provoked by Sander]
Well what's to say....  Today I stayed home and sat on my ass. Met a cool Peruvian kid that has everything in common with me [not as much as you Chris! so don't worry] and that was a pretty eventful conversation. Talking about good Peruvian beer and cholos...hahahaha. Well band practice starts next week [dun dun dun!]...drumline sucks with all the n00bs, the theme sucks, the program basically went down the shitter this year =( but all we can do is hope for the best I guess. I missed my dentist appt. today [yay!!] Dentists' are evil evil evil  people...the smell of their office makes me gag. Well anyways, that's all for now!    //Dey
I just took this from a portion of my xanga site....it's quite interesting...so I figured I would post it here.    WHATS THE PROBLEM WITH:        People: they concern themselves with trivial things. (probably because of capitalism) People are strange, they are the most powerful beings on this earth, and also the weakest. They give in to corruption, the government, greed...... They are the ones that create the world we live in, and ultimately, they will be the cause of our destruction.        Life: Again, one of the most controversial things. The basis is quite simple, but understanding the meaning of life, and what it is is nearly impossible. Life is great, if you make it to be. Sometimes we don't have that choice. Some of us are born into misfortune and failures. It's hard to break free, but the struggle is the part where life loses it's meaning. Life is a gift. Everyone dies, but not everyone lives.        Your country: Peru is my country. The US is my country. I consider them both to be my own, but in my heart, I'm from Peru, and that will always be home. The US is the most powerful country in the world, but they are too damn nosy. Everything here has a hidden part to it, it is called the land of opportunity, yet that isn't necessarily true. There are so many things wrong with this country, and nearly ALL of it comes from one source; the GOVERNMENT. Politics hurt our minds, our very beings. It dictates how we live and what we will make of ourselves. Our very existence depends on the balance in the world of politics, democracy and the government. The same applies for Peru, I don't remember much of it, but i left it because of politics, and oppression.
I'm in pain.    My body feels old and everything aches. I don't know why. All of a sudden it just feels like my body has been battered and left to die.  Hmm.....  My birthday is this Sunday.    16   years on this planet.  I feel old already yet it's quite a young age to everyone else. I'm not looking forward to this birthday so much. I know my family won't be together so that's probably one of the reasons why I'm not planning on doing anything. I'll just spend it by myself, or with my parents. It may seem a bit dull to you, but this time,   I honestly don't see any importance in turning a year older  . I won't feel any different, nothing new will be bestowed upon me, nada.   Zero.   I don't care for 'Sweet 16' parties and the like. I don't see it as anything more than   an opportunity to waste your money foolishly  . I didn't even have the traditional 'quinciaÃ±era' all hispanic girls go psycho over. I have everything I need, and I don't believe turning 15 or 16 will   open my eyes to adulthood   or make me any wiser. It's just the way I am, I am....ME. I prefer to save my money and buy something useful. Perhaps I will regret this decision later on in life, but for now I   live in the present   and that is what I care about the most.  Another thought that has been on my mind lately is the pondering of my recent   'symbolic' nightmares  . I have never dreamt so often in my life. Perhaps it means something?  A couple of days ago I dreamt I was in a graveyard that was overlooked by an immense temple. The temple was enormous and looked ancient, I remember a year.   A.D. 1111  . I have seen that number before yet I forget what it symbolizes. There was a mist shrouding the graves, which were quite old, but one detail that I remember vividly is noticing the   graves of children  . I was just walking through these graves in this oppresive environment as peacefully as ever. Not noticing the   scent of death  .  Yesterday I got home around 10AM, I immediately went to sleep. As soon as I fell asleep I was pulled into another dream. In this dream I was fighting with two, seemingly   demonic beings  . I wasn't sure what they were. They had human form, but they were something else. What I remember most is the sensation of being   bitten   on my right shoulder. It was so painful that I went   numb   from my fingertips all the way up to my shoulder. That's when I jerked awake, I   felt the pain   in my shoulder and I was   disoriented   for quite a while. It was so realistic, I actually felt the pain the rest of the day.  Then last night I had the most puzzling of dreams. I dreamt of   a young man I didn't recognize  . I was nearly   killed   in that dream. It was a scene of torture, although this time I didn't feel the pain in reality. I remember him putting   crushed glass in the palm of my hand  blood rushing from the wounds   and making me close my hand with his around it, pressing my flesh against the glass. Then i had the feeling of   being cut   over and over and over again. I saw myself, but I saw myself from the   perspective of someone else  . I   don't   remember seeing myself   cry   or   wince from the pain  . I just took the abuse as if I could not feel a thing. I just saw   flesh and blood  . The one detail I remember most is the   black clothing and crushed glass.    In a short dreaming following that, I saw myself falling over a   waterfall  , down into the waters below. I lived. I   didn't feel   any   fear  , or   pain  . It was pure....  tranquility  .       I don't know if this is trying to tell me something. Maybe it is, maybe it's not, I will just have to find out sooner or later. All I can do for now is ponder away.....
These days the music industry seems to put out worthless commercial crap. Rap has gone to hell; all we see is vulgarity in their videos, music, image, etc. The era of teen pop is over and done with. Or is it? Everyday we have these 13-17 year old artists coming out with 'pop/rock' albums, full of songs that talk about the same things and melodies that sound the same. We have them talking about relationships, sex, drugs, violence, etc. People actually buy this and like it.  Every year it gets worse. Decency (even to a limited extent) has gone to hell, lyrics are more raunchy, videos are bordering on porn; it's disgusting really.  It's good music they say. Ha! People have lost the idea of what 'good music' is. Give them some sugar coated album by some 13 year old and it's 'omg she's so talented!!! she's gonna be around forever!!! Grammy!!'. Same thing with any rap/r&amp;b artist. Rock has also lost the foundation of what it used to be. Thankfully for me, I still love trance.....and you don't hear it on the radio here, in other bigger cities, yeah, but not here. Hehe, at least the scene hasn't gone to hell just yet.
Sometimes I would like to be alone all the time, the peace is unrelenting and it's so....precious. Then people come inflitrate my world and it all starts. The constant bitching, the orders, the excuses, the insults. I wish I could shut off my ears to all their idiosyncrasies. It's poison, that's all it is. It ruins me and makes my happiness decompose as rapidly as some dead animal, it's slow, the acrid feelings linger for ages, and it's torturing. You just want it to end, the end is the biggest reward. It's like being on a bad acid trip, it's wonderful in the beginning and then you crash, it's terrible. (From what I know and have seen, it's not like I use drugs). Such a change of moods makes you angry, unreasonable, and then they take it out on me. It's not a great feeling to have your mother call you a 'demented freak' or an 'antisocial idiot'. That's what leads me to write these depressing entries. I don't enjoy it, I want to write about something happy for once. I don't want to come off as pessimistic, I love life. I just want to enjoy it and be free from everyone. I am made happy everyday by someone but it's a terrible feeling to know it won't last once those people decide to come here and ruin me, everyday. Then I just have my few happy memories to hang on to, and that gets me through the day. Someone saves me everyday. =) Yeah, those are my few little rants for today.   I'm tired.

Valuable advice:   'That is goal obsession, which is a subset of wanting to win too much. It rears its ugly head in many ways. In its broadest form, it's the force at play when we get so wrapped up in achieving our goal that we do it at the expense of a larger mission.'   urlLink Fast Company Goal 1 Mission 0   Solution:  'The solution is simple, but not easy. You have to step back, take a breath, and look around. Survey the conditions that are making you obsessed with the wrong goals. Time and deadline pressures come with being a leader. We confront them every minute of every day. They do not go away. Which makes it all the more important to reflect upon our work, match it up against the life we want to live, and consider, 'What am I doing?' and 'Why am I doing this?' Ask yourself, 'Am I achieving a task and forgetting my organization's mission? Am I making money to support my family -- and forgetting the family that I am trying to support?''

Something we constantly forget is that data quality plays a key role in integration with SOA due to:  'Because SOAs emphasize loosely coupled interactions between services, they must move data from one service to another with enough context, quality, and syntactic structure to allow services to perform their tasks independently of any other. Each service must ensure that inbound and outbound data is not only syntactically correct, but also is valid and complete in the context of the business application being performed.'   urlLink Enterprise Architect - SOA's Achilles Heel

I'm starting anew.  Ditching the password-protected Diaryland and (gasp!) going public!  Stay tuned.  I'm hilarious sometimes.
Listening to:  Stevie  by Yesterdays New Quintet  I had a dream about Mama the other night.  She was bedridden; her body wasnt whole.  She was sickly looking, wasting away, her head covered with peach fuzz that couldnt grow back any thicker.  She looked very much the way she did in the last few weeks she was still alive, but in my dream she was just a torso and head, no arms or legs.  In my dream she said to me, Kiss  ko ,  anak ko  (Kiss me, my child).    Before Mama went unconscious [her body took weeks to shut down, little by little], she said to me, Kiss  ko , baby  ko  whenever she was aware that I was by her side.  Whenever I sat by her, she told me she loved me and I told her I loved herI never left her without saying it because I was always afraid it would be the last time for me to say it to her or to hear it from her.  The day after Mama went into her coma, Daddy called me, crying, telling me to go to Bakersfield.  He said the night before Mama's condition got even worse (to the point where she was just barely holding on), he and my Auntie Thelma were praying with her and she said something, but he couldn't make it out.  He said after she repeated it a couple of times, he realized she was calling for me.  I drove for four hours to be by Mama's side, early the next morning; the second I walked through the door and went to her, she focused her eyes on me for a bit.  Then they rolled back into her head; I slept on the floor next to her that night.  The following evening she passed away.   Sigh.   A couple days ago I also dreamed about my boss.  Her father passed away from cancer also; he died about a week ago.  My friend Ks father also passed away from cancer a couple of months ago.  K didnt know my mom passed away til last week, when we talked a little bit about our experiences.  Mel mentioned to me that a new Hyphen staffer on the edit team's mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer (my mom had breast cancer).  Crazy.    Ive been toying around with putting together a fundraiser.  I know I want to have a big joint birthday party with Adrienne in September, so maybe that could be it?  Charge like $5 at the door and donate all the proceeds to the American Cancer Society in my moms memory.  Well see.  Anyhow. Sorry to go on about cancer and death so early in the morning.  Hmmm  This morning is the exception, but generally I have this routine of watching the news as I get ready.  I watch local news on Channel 3 and NBCs Today Show.  Yes, I loves me some Matt Lauer.  Um, is it bad that I find Scott Peterson to be attractive?  I mean he's got that tall, dark, handsome, brooding thing going on.  But then again, that whole dark/brooding thing could just be my own personal bias from all the trial coverage Ive seen.  Really, though, hes a good-looking man.  Once I glossed over the cover of a tabloid paper while at the grocery store and the picture of him made me do a double take.  From the angle, I thought he looked like my old USSC (Ultimate Super Secret Crush).  They look similar, but my USSCs face isnt so angular and his eyes are more Asian looking (my [old] USSC is hapa/ mestizo /half Asian).  And how about the hot 23-year old teacher who had sex with one of her students?  So Mary Kay Letorneau.  Sounds like the average adolescent males fantasy to me, no?  I thought about itand go ahead and think Im screwed upbut if Mr. Rapp (my 8th grade history teacher) or Mr. Davis (my 12th grade AP History teacher) wanted to seduce me when I was younger  HOLLA!  But its not like at 13 or 16 I wouldve really known what was going on.  Like, Why is your thing all big and sticking straight out?  It looks funny...  You wanna put it in my what?   WHAT!?    Ay naku .  For real.  Yikes.  Aiight, I gotta get back to Hatty about this e-flyer design for the Hyphen event.  And search for these last 11 publications on Bacon's for a big media mailing on Tuesday.  My work is never done.    Have a happy holiday weekend.  Drive safe, eat lots of barbecue, dont use illegal fireworks and blow your hand off, and all that good stuff.  Im spending time with my dad and my crazy aunties (my dads younger sisters) in Milpitas, so you know its ON with the Filipino food!  NUMMIES for me!
One Week, One Week!  Hello from Kinko's.  I only worked from 11 AM to 3 PM at Panache today; afterwards I headed downtown to the Mother Jones office to drop off six boxes of Hyphen magazines to Yuki (the publisher).  The past three issues, I was the one to pick them up and drop them off to Yuki.  Yuki has the funniest reaction when she sees the magazine for the first time, after it comes back from the printer.  As she turns the pages, her eyes get bigger and bigger and she'll be like, 'Yes!'  The 'yes!' gets louder and louder--I liken it to an orgasm.  With that said: one week til the Hyphen one-year anniversary party!  One week!  One week!  I'm so excited!  Oliver and Mike are spinning!  They're my favorites!  In my old Diaryland I used to refer to Oliver (O-Dub) as 'myyyyy heeerrroooo!'  At Directions In Sound, back in March, he did the best set.  He played Alicia Keys over this rocksteady-reggae sample.  I almost died, it was so good!  And Mike?  Mike's like  kuya  (big brother).  He DJs every event I've ever put together, just about.  I owe him lots of big fat kisses and hugs and dinner and drinks (and more money).  I guess that's why he's called Mike Nice, huh?  Me being me, I'm also worried about numbers (attendance).  I'm always worried about turnout, even if I have a good feeling.  (Like for Hyphen's launch party last year, I knew around 600 heads would turn out, and did.  But I still stressed on it.)  But I think I'm doing better with the worrying--I know everything's locked down.  As far as logistics go, all details are taken care of (or will be).  I meet Adrienne in about forty minutes; we'll do all the decoration shopping at Party City (or whatever it's called) in Daly City.  Adrienne and I are the Dynamic Pinay Duo at Hyphen!  But no more Hyphen talk.  All I ever talk about is work.  Let's talk about  BOYS .  I have a new crush.  I shall think up a good secret name for him, so I can refer to him in my blog, without his knowing.  (You know, just in case he ever reads my blog.)  When I was on Diaryland I referred to my old crush as USSC (Ultimate Super Secret Crush).  I had a crush on him for like 5 years (seriously).  I still sort of have a crush on him, but I am open to new crushes (that I might actually do something about).  My new crush is a cutie.  *Swoon!*  I think I might have the guts to flirt with him and be more forward, but sometimes I get too in my head thinking he wouldn't be interested in me.  We're different in a lot of ways, though our circles overlap.  He's older, too.  I'm probably too wannabe ghettofabulous and young for him.  But we could have cute babies, I tell you!  (Oh, who am I kidding?  I'm having lots of fun just swooning, so imagine how I'd react if sex factored into the equation.  Mwahaha!)  Anyhow.  I should go eat before I meet Adrienne.  I've been dying to try Quizno's.  Am I the last person in the world to eat at Quizno's?  I need to eat before I drive out to Daly City and get lost in the rice cooker fog.
A day of wasting time at work...  Two blogs in one day?      For the past hour or two I've been doing Hyphen stuff and just messing around on this website: illustmaker.abi-station.com/index_en.shtml   Try it out.  Everyone in Hyphen made little icons of themselves.  I didn't get a chance til now.  I dunno if the icon really looks like me, but I tried.  I will figure out how to get my icon on here.  F*** a real picture, it's all about an Audrey gif!  Ha!  Okay.  More media mapping and data entry to do.  I'm here til 6 PM unfortunately.  Boo.
'Bow-wow'  Listening to: Zero 7 on iTunes Eating: Spinach and cheese crepe.  (Will be washed down with Tums and a bottle of water.)  A lunchtime post, as I am on a break at one of my jobs.  (That's right--ONE of my jobs.  I'm all 'Hey Mon' Jamaican [no offense to Jamaicans] like that skit from In Living Color.)  Some-freaking-body keeps calling my cell from an 'unavailable' number.  I have this policy of not answering such calls unless I'm expecting someone with a blocked # to call me (like Nam).  This person has been calling me the past week, not ONCE leaving a message.  It's getting on my last nerve.  I check my voicemail, dammit!  Leave a message, motherfucker!  Okay.  Rant over.  Everyone involved with Hyphen complains (from time to time) about not being paid for what they do.  I'm totally guilty of this also.  But I realized today, as I spent TWO HOURS emailing press releases (to people who gave in-kind donations, community co-presenters, performers, event posting sites), that I use the Internet at my legit jobs for Hyphen...  It's like I'm getting paid by another company to do Hyphen work.  I need a tshirt that says something like, 'Hyphen Magazine: Keeping it gangsta!'  But only I can wear it.  Because I said so.  So, this morning I drove in to work.  I turned the music up super-loud so I wouldn't have to hear how the tires make a grinding noise when I slow down/stop, because the brake pads are thin.  Yeah, that's pathetic (and probably even 'ghetto'), but so what?  My car is six-years old and it's got almost 200,000 miles on it from all the driving back and forth between Bakersfield/LA and the Bay Area the past four years Mama was doing chemotherapy.  I hope to replace the old green Turtle Mobile SUV with a smaller hybrid Ford Escape (when those finally come out).  (I grew up in the suburbs; I'm all about driving a bigger car since I learned how to drive in a soccer mom minivan.)  Walking to the office, I passed by a wall with a ripped up movie poster on it advertising that Johnson Family Vacation (or whatever) film on it.  I had to laugh because it had Lil Bow-wow on it.  I didn't laugh because of Lil Bow-wow trying to be an actor, but some weird word association thing that comes to mind whenever I hear 'bow-wow' now.  Two weekends ago I was in Milpitas at my Auntie Baby's house (every Filipino has an Auntie Baby).  My Auntie Aurea (like Oreo with an 'a' at the end) was trying to be all cool and tell dirty jokes to us youngsters (my younger cousins and I).  She was telling a joke about 69, but calling it 'bow-wow.'  She sat down on the floor, stuffed animal in her clutches, demonstrating this 'bow-wow' phenomenon.  She bowed her neck so her face was buried in the poor teddy bear's butt/crotch (that's the 'bow' part), then she was like, 'Wow!'  I guess you had to be there to see it and think it was funny.  My cousins and I were laughing hysterically.  My stomach hurt from all the laughing.  Auren (my cousin), Auntie Aurea's daughter, was like, 'MOTHER!'  Yeah.  'Bow-wow.'  All my Ednalino aunties are seriously  bastos  (nasty).  My mom had a bawdy sense of humor too, so I guess I get it from both sides of the family.  Mama's old co-workers used to call her Hot Mama because of it.  There were instances when I was younger, when I would pretend to not understand Tagalog, so I could listen in on the things all the adults would say.  And I had a hard time keeping a straight face during all those ' ay, ka tigas-tigas /Oh, it's so hard!' and  buhok /hair in the  pancit  (noodle dish) jokes.  Ai-ya.
Listening to: Bittersweeet - DJ Neil Armstrong  Wah!  I'm super-hungry.  (No.  Make that 'hongry!')  I haven't eaten anything at all today; I only drank a cup of coffee.  It's been  that  kind of a day.  Yes.  Busy me.  What did I do today?  So much.  I was at the Panache office today, working my little PR gig.  Working at Panache Communications is pretty fun; definitely a ton of work.  It's high tech PR, so it's totally different than what I'm used to doing with Hyphen or Directions In Sound (music and film) publicity.  Last week I started work on a last minute project, researching media for the Internet media arm of a big (can't name drop--I signed a contract that doesn't allow it) advertising company that just completed the Spanish and Chinese language sites for a major airline (again, can't name drop).  The other week I did analyst research on the wireless/GPS industry, for MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators--think Boost Mobile or Virgin Mobile).  My next project is to write copy for a DM (direct mail) for the Panache PR Pearls e-newsletter.  I am trying to get into high tech/investor relations PR, to compare it with entertainment PR.  Two extremes, I know, but I can't quite figure out what it is I want to do with the skills and experience I have.  Enough PR shop talk.  I know it must be boring to read about.  So...  Earlier this afternoon (after I got off work from Panache), I picked up issue 4 of Hyphen magazine from the printer in South City (that's South San Francisco, for all y'all non-locals).  All 22 boxes fit into my car (back seats pushed down, of course).  My car was so laden down with excess weight, I had to drive like an old lady to my place and drop of 6 boxes before driving to Oakland to drop another 6 boxes off at Melissa's.   Poor green Turtle Power Mobile.  I love you.  You've been so good to me.   Don't worry.  You're getting new tires and break pads this weekend.  :)  Anyhow.  Hyphen issue 4 looks DAMN good, let me tell you.  Vivid colors, nice paper stock, great content.  Oh, and didja know there's gonna be a par-tay on the 9th?  Yeah, stay tuned.  I'll be plug-plugging away...once I get the freaking final draft of the press release done.  (Tonight, I promise!)  I've just been in a strange mood all day.  Mad impatient.  I actually bitched out this car/driver in front of me in traffic today.  I was pissed that I was riding his ass when all of a sudden he decides to parallel park.  I had to wait til all the cars in the lane on my right passed by til I could switch.  Grrr!    I'm sure part of my having a short fuse today has to do with not eating all day, but also just that I woke up early, all annoyed at my landlord's dog.  The damned dog just doesn't know when to shut up.  He (his name is Gino) starts barking, and then the dog next door starts barking...  Sheesh.  When I was unloading boxes of magazines into my storage space this afternoon, Gino started barking at me.  I was about to get my neck-roll on, for real.  Just start swearing at Gino in Taglish: 'Shut the f*** up, Gino!   Lutuin kita, ha /I'll cook you!'  Sometimes I want to grab that dog by the ears and tell him he'll be  adobong na aso  (dog adobo).  Mmmm.  Adobo.  I am so hungry.   Sigh.
Listening to: So Much Soul (Volume 2) by Vinroc   So I've been pretty busy the past month or so.  Just one thing after another.  Not a bad busy, though.  Today was my day off.  I had a day off last week--the 40th day of mourning since Mama passed away.  I don't know if the 40th day thing is a Filipino or Catholic thing, but I took the day off to reflect on my own, since I'm not Catholic.  I realized last Wednesday that although I still miss Mama terribly, lately (because I've had so much work to do, and have been busying myself by hanging out with my friends) it doesn't  hurt  to miss Mama.  I am still wearing her wedding and engagement rings to remind me of her.  I don't know when I'll be taking them off, but for now I like having the reminder--like she's always with me.  I went to see Fahrenheit 911 today at the Metreon, by myself.  My eyes teared up a few times.    The first instance was in the beginning, before the shots of 9/11 came on, before Michael Moore showed reactions of people watching the planes fly into the WTC.  It brought me back to the trauma of that day, how surreal and scary it was for me, even though I was far removed from it all.  I was grateful Moore didn't show any footage of the planes actually flying into the buildings.  I remember that day--I was at school, watching a TV in the library, and I started crying as I watched people jumping out of windows in the WTC.  The second time I started tearing up during the film was when Moore showed Iraqis condemning American troops and President Bush for killing civilians.  There was an older woman lamenting the senseless death of her brother and the bombing of his home.  It was like she had the same exact words to convey how I feel about the loss of my mom, even though my loss is a result of something different.  Cancer, war--both senseless losses to me.  Mama was a beautiful person who fought for a long time.  I'm still trying to make sense of why she was taken from me.  Yeah, walking out of Fahrenheit 911, I felt really disturbed about American politics/government.  I'm pretty apathetic about politics, but I do my best to stay informed so my opinions aren't half-assed.  During the film was the first time in a long time that I felt really compelled to  do something .  Anyhow.  I just spoke to Daddy today; he's coming up to the Bay Area for the 4th of July holiday weekend.  It will be the first time for him to visit me here since I was a freshman living in the dorm.  Even then, we didn't get to spend time together.  I just remember getting a random call from him that he was in town for a few days.  He came by my dorm and dropped off a TV and VCR for me, gave me some pocket change--and he was gone.    I'm excited--this time I hope to take him out to eat, walk around, whatever.  I didn't get to spend time with him when I was in San Diego at the beginning of the month.  Daddy's not very adventurous about food, and lots of things are  bawal  for him (not good for him to eat; can trigger his gout).  But maybe Daddy will like real Thai food (there's no real Thai food in Bakersfield), or even Burma Superstar?    We'll see.
My 4th of July weekend got off to a crazy start.  I was supposed to go to work Friday, and make a stop in Millbrae to pick up a newspaper for Eelynn (one of the account supervisors at Panache).  But when I exited onto Highway 1, right by my house, I felt my car jerk and saw the brake light turn red, so I pulled over on the side of the freeway to assess the situation.  When I tried to stop, I had to coast for a bit, and then my brakes were grinding til I completely stopped.  I was on the side of the highway, cars zooming past.  My dad was going to go with me to a mechanic the next day to get new tires and brake pads.  (Does that constitute irony?)  I called AAA to come tow my ass home or to the closest auto shop.  While waiting, some CHP (California Highway Patrol, for those who didn't grow up watching CHiPs) pig rolled up behind me, beeping at me.  Like I was dangerous or some shit, he's all, 'Ma'am, get back in your car, please.'  (I was walking around my car to see if I could tell anything was wrong, fixable.)  I was on the passenger side and sat down in the passenger seat.  Then the cop came up and made this motion, meaning he wanted me to roll down my window and talk to me.  The way I was sitting was awkward, because there were things at the foot of the passenger side, so I had to twist in a funny way to face the officer.  I could tell he was all looking down my blouse.  I was thinking, 'This cop's trying to scope out my titties!'  So I sort of arched my back so my cleavage would be more prominent, thinking, 'Maybe if I give him an innocent look-see, he'll be more efficient and helpful.'  Didn't happen.  I ended up telling the cop that I had already called AAA and someone was coming to tow my shit away within the hour.  The tow truck took me to the closest Firestone, then Firestone told me it would cost over $600 to fix my brakes because my right brake pad fell out and the right rotor (whatever that is) was grinding on metal, so theres a chance they wouldnt have to replace just the rotor on the right side, but the caliper (whatever that is), too.  I called Eugene (my landlord), to see if he could come pick me up, and as we talked more about my car problems, he told me to have my car towed back to the house and his friend would work on it this weekend and only charge me for parts.  (Filipinos always trying to be thrifty and use hook-ups.)  So I had AAA tow my car back (Im a Southern Cali member, so I get more tow mileage allowance), and Eugene had his mechanic friend order new brake pads and rotors for my car (he said it will only cost me $400 even) but  Its Tuesday and my car still has yet to be fixed.  But I fly down to San Diego for a few days tomorrow anyhow.  Doesnt matter.  Ill be back in time (Thursday) to prep for the Hyphen One-Year event at Lamia, and Ill just rent a car for a day or two.  I told Eugene my car HAS to be fixed on Saturday.  Anyhow, Daddy and his two  kumpares  (friends) drove up from Auntie Babys house in Milpitas to pick me up on Saturday morning (they slept at Auntie Babys for the holiday weekend).  They drove me to Milpitas and I got to eat  halo-halo  (hadnt had that in yearsit was so yummy!), crab, lots of pork (cant be Filipino and not eat pork!),  dinuguan  (chocolate meat) and  daing  (fish marinated in vinegar and then deep fried or grilled).  I got annoyed with my aunties because they were telling my dad to tell me to stop wearing my moms engagement and wedding rings.  Theyre concerned about some guy seeing me wearing the rings (on the wrong hand!) and thinking Im married.  But I really dont care about any cock-block action.  No guy (that I would bother looking at twice) has tried to holla at me in the past 6 months anyhow, so Im not tripping.  My minds not even there, really (on guys).  Its definitely not priority.  My aunties are probably worried that Im a lesbian or will become a spinster who forsakes love for career, or something.  (They nag me like, Youre going to be 26 and you dont have a boyfriend?  When are you planning on getting married?  Mama and Daddy brought me up to not to worry about living my life according to some schedule.)  When Im around my aunties I just wont wear the rings.  Aside from these two pictures Ive tucked away in my wallet, they are the only travel sized reminders of Mama that I can take along with me on a daily basis.  In any case, I have a pretty busy week since Ill be in San Diego for a few days and then the Hyphen event is Friday night.  Im going down to San Diego because my dad finally got work orders to go to Japan (my dad works for the Department of DefenseMilitary Sealift Command [hes also retired Navy]), and he leaves for port on Saturday.  I want to spend as much time with him as I can; I wont see him again for another 4-6 months (til around Christmas).  I probably wont be able to communicate with him much except random 3 AM phone calls once or twice a month, and brief emails written in all caps every other week.  When Daddys at work, Ill have nobody to claim toIll be alone in the world  It really makes me miss Mama to think about it that way.   Sigh .  Okay, write again soon.  Hyphen meeting tonight to discuss last minute logistics for our anniversary event and label/package mags to send out to subscribers, then I gotta get home and pack!  Byeeee!
Where is the Love?  &nbsp;  I was watching the news this morning and so I have some things to comment on:  &nbsp;  Martha Stewart is going to jail for five months.&nbsp; She got an easy sentence for insider trading.&nbsp; Dont get me started on the race/celebrity thing.&nbsp; I could go off on a rambling diatribe, citing OJ Simpson and R Kelly along the way.  &nbsp;  The Philippines is pulling out of Iraq.&nbsp; All 50-some troops.&nbsp; (Yes, Im taking a sarcastic tone.)&nbsp; The Filipino hostage, from what Ive been hearing on the local news, has family in Pacifica (where I live).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Im all in my little bubble, concerned about paying off student loans, moving into a new apartment and furnishing it, buying a new Mac laptop and iPod, turning 26, switching gym memberships, finding a good place to get my hair cut at and bikini waxed&nbsp; Im wondering when my new health insurance will kick in so I can go get my wisdom teeth pulled out&nbsp; My little life is so shallow in comparison to all the other things going on in this world, but it stresses me out nonetheless.  &nbsp;  Sigh.  &nbsp;  Yesterday Eugene (my landlord) was like, Are you really moving out?&nbsp; You havent started packing yet&nbsp; I was like, I dont move til the 28th or 29th and I dont have very much to pack (my room is so small, half my shit has remained packed and stashed away in this storage crawl space beneath my closet).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Eugenes upset that hes losing a tenant who never seems to be home, keeps to herself, doesnt make a lot of noise and pays her rent/utilities on time.&nbsp; (Yeah, and being Filipino is sometimes a good enough pass with  kababayan  [other Filipinos] for them to trust/favor you.)  &nbsp;  When I moved to Pacifica in April, I put an ad for myself in the seeking a room listings on Craigslist.&nbsp; Adrienne recommended it.&nbsp; She said it would be a lot more efficient because all I had to do was write about how fabulous I am and people would respond, thus Id have the pick of the crop (as far as living situation options).&nbsp; The only places I really liked, that were in my price range, were in Pacifica.&nbsp; I actually wanted to move into a 2-bedroom with another girl my own age (she had a little aquarium with a turtle in it in the living room) just up the street (across from Kenkoyswhere I get Filipino food on the regular), but she took too long to decide and I ended up moving into Eugenes house.  &nbsp;  It hasnt been bad, except once in a while Gino (Eugenes dog) gets on my nerves.&nbsp; And Ive had to totally change my eating habits because I dont have kitchen access (but Eugene provided me a mini fridge and a microwave).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Eugene and my little Pacifica room served me well for the time I was here.&nbsp; I was gone most of April and May anyhowI was in Bakersfield for like 5 weeks when Mama got sicker and passed away.&nbsp; Although I will miss the free cable, I wont miss the stupid dryer that still didnt dry my clothes after a one-hour permanent press cycle.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyhow.&nbsp; I woke up this morning, to a Black Eyed Peas video on VH1.&nbsp; (Id fallen asleep watching TVVH1s I love the 90s series.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It made me want to rip my ears off--'Hey Mama!'&nbsp; UGH.&nbsp; Am I the only Filipino who doesnt think theyre that great just because one of the members if half-Pinoy?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hmmm.&nbsp; Last night I finished reading  Sex, Drugs &amp; Cocoa Puffs , so Im open to suggestions for additional reading material.&nbsp; I got started on  The Fall of Advertising &amp; The Rise of PR , but Im off to a slow start because its not as captivating as I thought it would be.&nbsp; Last month I read this self-help book about daughters whose mothers have passed away, and this book by Danzy Senna (she wrote  Caucasia ) called  Symptomatic .&nbsp; Even though I watch a lot of TV and movies, I make sure to&nbsp;read a lot.&nbsp; Must be balanced that way.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Speaking of film&nbsp; I was pondering over  Before Sunset , which I saw yesterday after work.&nbsp; Its that film with Ethan Hawke, where he meets up (ten years later) with a woman he met on a train (and spent a night with) in Europe.&nbsp; A lot of the dialogue made me think of my old Ultimate Super Secret Crush (the crush I obsessed over for about 5 years).&nbsp; I started thinking what it might be like if he and I randomly met and hung out in like 5 or 10 years (after no contact for those 5-10 years)what would we talk about?&nbsp; Would being in his presence conjure up all my old crush feelings?  &nbsp;  Crushes suck.&nbsp; When theres a crush situation, usually one person has the upper handnamely the object of the crush, who most likely doesnt have reciprocal feelings.&nbsp; Im always the one with the crush; Ive always felt like this is a handicap, even though Im not one to wear my heart on my sleeve.  &nbsp;  I hope I dont ever speak to, hear from or run into my old USSC.&nbsp; I cant even stand to hear/say his name nowadaysit makes me sad and a bit hurt (angry/bitter).&nbsp; Id much rather hate him now than remember how full of stupidity and hope I was, when I thought I was in (unrequited) love with him or that there was a slight chance he (at one time) might have been interested in me.&nbsp; Hell always be the one that got away, the unresolved unrequited crush, I suppose.  &nbsp;  I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.&nbsp; I hope you miss me.
Sex, Drugs &amp; Shopping Therapy  &nbsp;  Listening to: Tommy Guerrero, yeah!  &nbsp; There's a cute Filipino boy who works at Kinko's, but I have a feeling I'm&nbsp;too old for him.&nbsp; Watch him be like 19 or&nbsp;20 or&nbsp;something.&nbsp; I see him whenever I go&nbsp;to Kinko's in Colma.&nbsp;  Holla! &nbsp; (Yeah, right.) &nbsp; Anyhoo.&nbsp; I had this revelation about 'star-fuckers.'&nbsp; Having worked film festivals the past 5 years, I encounter a lot of people who hope to meet actors and directors--star-fuckers.&nbsp; But me?&nbsp; I've never been starstruck.&nbsp; Not when I met Qbert, not when I met Wayne Wang, not when I met Sandra Oh...&nbsp; However, I recently had a little dose of it.&nbsp; I helped out with the Frameline Film Festival last month (the SF Int'l Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Fest) and the Opening Night film was Touch of Pink.&nbsp; I was working the press line and had to be one girl in a human blockade to prevent starfuckers from trying to ask autographs from Jimmy Mistri and Kyle McLachlan.&nbsp; When Kyle McLachlan stepped out of the limo I was like, 'Wow, he's really tall.&nbsp; He's really handsome.'&nbsp; I thought he looked so regal.&nbsp; I was starstruck for about 15 minutes.&nbsp; And then this weekend Mel and I took my cousins to Amoeba in Berkeley and once I walked in I saw Lyrics Born at the cashier, paying for some CDs.&nbsp; I walked up to him and said, 'Hi, Tom.'&nbsp; Not that I expected him to remember that I used to intern at Quannum in 1998, or this exchange we had about me jocking his 'Palm P.' But... &nbsp; I forget what my point is.&nbsp; Let's move on. &nbsp; I&nbsp;have been watching lots of movies this&nbsp;week (it's only Thursday), going after work (because I get off early enough to catch matinees).&nbsp; So far this week I've seen Anchorman, Saved! and today I saw Before Sunset.&nbsp; I&nbsp;realized that my whole movie kick is because I'm feeling down. &nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; I've been super-tired since&nbsp;this week started.&nbsp; Like all the hectic Hyphen stuff is over, my dad arrived in Japan on Sunday night--there's nothing more for me to really focus&nbsp;all my energy on anymore, for me to avoid feeling sad again about my mom.&nbsp; I know I'm depressed when I eat shitty foods and all I want to do is sleep (or my sleeping habits&nbsp;change--I've been falling asleep at 10:30 PM the past few nights,&nbsp;and waking up at 2 or 3 AM, then going back to sleep til abouta 7 AM) or shop. &nbsp; Anyhow.&nbsp; It'll surpass, I know.&nbsp; Just takes time... &nbsp; I feel&nbsp;a strange tickle in my throat, indicating the onset of a cold.&nbsp; You know that feeling, when it hurts to swallow?&nbsp; Sometimes I think thats worse than actually having a cold.  &nbsp;  Anyhow.&nbsp; Some retard tried to talk to me at the Barnes &amp; Noble in Colma yesterday.&nbsp; I was walking around the magazine section, trying to find Fast Company, and lo and behold an IT-looking white guy (you know what Im talking about) locks me on his Pinay Radar.&nbsp;  Why does it always have to be skanky, greasy-haired, IT-looking white guys who like Filipinas?&nbsp;  WHY?    &nbsp;  Acting cool and oblivious, I took my stack of magazines and sat down in Starbucks with an iced soy mocha.&nbsp; The guy sat down at an empty table across from me and struck up a conversation.&nbsp; The guy mentioned something about how hes totally into CHRIS ISAAK.&nbsp; How he used to be an avid watcher of The Chris Isaak Show on HBO, how Chris Isaak is considered geeky because hes misunderstood and people only remember that video he did with Helena Christensen.&nbsp; I wasnt sure if I was being testedwas this guy being for real?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I didnt want to find out.&nbsp; I was like, Peace out, dude.&nbsp; I was outta there with the quickness.  &nbsp;  HOW is it that the guys who try to talk to me are always dorky, desperate, socially inept white IT-looking guys?&nbsp; Oh, and lets not forget homelesshomeless men love harassing me.&nbsp; One time on Haight Street, I walked by this homeless guy who was like, Come on baby, Ill show you a good time.&nbsp; He made these air-humping gestures, flicking his tongue out in that lascivious (I wanna eat you out) sort of way, chanting, Pussy!&nbsp; Pussy!&nbsp; Ugh.  &nbsp;  So back to my pining: Why cant the guys I find attractive be attracted to me?&nbsp; Why cant I get chatted up by guys who have all their teeth, who dont look like greasy IT guys with Filipina fetishes, or guys who look like a crackhead/pimp character from a Dave Chapelle skit?&nbsp; Why are the guys I like not interested in me, only want to be my friend, already attached, or gay?&nbsp; Ive been asking myself these questions for 25 years now.  &nbsp;  About nine months ago I was talking to this guy from Virginia who I met really randomly (translation: online/Friendster).&nbsp; He was totally different than mehe listened to mainstream alternative (think Hoobastank and Incubus) and worked for some tech company based in SF that always had him out in the field (Dallas for two weeks, London for one week, etc., etc.).&nbsp; He was a Good Southern Boy who was in a frat in collegea frat where he had lots of Filipino pledge brothers, and so he developed a thing for hot, petite Pinay girls.&nbsp; He would tell me, in mangled Tagalog,  Maganda ka /Youre pretty.  Can you say GROSS!?  &nbsp;  Ben (that was his name) tried to sway me to be more understanding; accused me of being REVERSE RACIST.&nbsp; I was like, First of all, you cant talk race or racism with methats what my whole college experience was about.&nbsp; And second of all, Im not racist, Im CAUTIOUS.&nbsp; I mean, if you were me and some white guy found out what ethnicity you were, then reacted like, Oh my God, youre Filipina?&nbsp; Filipinas are totally HOT! wouldnt you be freaked out, too?&nbsp; I mean, could you be more obvious about being excited to dabble in Otherness?&nbsp; I want someone to like me because they like ME and not my Filipino-ness.&nbsp; (I should mention that it didnt help when Ben admitted to me, after I asked him if hed ever dated any Asian/Filipina girls, that he hadnt because theyd all prefer to be his friend.&nbsp; Gee, I wonder why.)  &nbsp;  Where oh where is a cute, smart, ambitious, hip, self-deprecating Asian or hapa guy for moi?&nbsp; Someone who finds my neuroses amusing?&nbsp; Someone who can hold his own when introduced to my crazy family (that sounds so  My Big Fat Greek Wedding , I know)?&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; I want cute little Asian babies, like the one Angelina Jolie adopted.&nbsp; Can I specifically ask for Asian sperm if I opt for artificial insemination because nobody likes me?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sometimes I fear that Im doomed to be single the rest of my life.&nbsp; (Thats not necessarily a bad thing, I knowall my aunties think if I end up single its because Im some career-minded Type A bitch.)&nbsp; For Valentines Day next year, while all my friends are out on dates, Im going to have to go to that one gay male strip club my friend told me about where you can grab on The D for $30 admission.&nbsp; I think its called Knob Hill or its in Nob Hill, or something like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Okay, Im totally babbling right now.&nbsp; I've been writing so much lately; I need to stop. &nbsp; Sigh.
Pimp My Ride, Just Like Jessica Simpson  This weekend I got sized for a new bra at Victorias Secret.  I was rocking out in the fitting room with all the bras the sales girls handed to me to try on, living out my wannabe video girl fantasies.  They were playing Justin Timberlake (Like I Love You with The Clipse) and Beyonce (Naughty Girl), so you can imagine all the solo dance routines and lip-synching that ensued in front of my dressing room mirror.  But more on that later  I went to see Anchorman yesterday afternoon.  I dunno how I feel about Will Ferrell.  Im not sure if I think hes funny or stupid, but I was in the mood to laugh.  The film was worth the $6.75 for a matinee.  I held back from seeing Spiderman 2 because Yvette and I made plans to see it this Saturday.    Blah.  Countdown, peoples!  Two and a half weeks before I move out of my little Pacifica room, to a Lake Merritt (Lake Merritt is near downtown Oakland) walk-up with hardwood floors and lots of closet space.  Im moving in with Melissa (the editor of Hyphen and fellow Turtle Lover).  Im so excited!  Ill be an East Bay Area-n again!  Mel and I are both turtle girls, and anal retentive about cleanliness and organization, so I think were a good match.  I have a feeling well be talking (bitching) a lot about Hyphen, not to mention harboring tons of Hyphen crap in our big hallway closet, but  I finally get to live in a really nice place, with someone I am friends with (as opposed to strangers I found/who found me on Craigslist).  J  Most importantly, I get to cook again!  Ive gone the past three months living off of take out, so Im dying to cook adobo, garlic fried rice and spamsilog (spam and eggs over rice)!  Yay!  Anyhow.  Im enjoying my new bras.  HA! This weekend my cousins were visiting from San Diego, so I took them down to Valley Fair mall in Santa Clarathe upscale mall where they have Coach and Tiffanys.  I got fitted for a bra, which Id never bothered to do before.  I highly recommend that every woman does ityou might find that youre not the size youve been buying all these years.  The past 18 months my weight has gone(mostly) up and down and Ive fluctuated from a 34B up to a 36C.  I was starting to feel cinched in by my bra; when I got sized this weekend, I was told that I am now a 36D.  (Holla!)  I was thinking, 36D?  You mean I have Jessica Simpson boobies?  (I only know what bra size she wears because I read too many trashy Cosmo type mags.)  I think the letter D just freaks me outthe boobage seems excessive.  When I look down at my chest, I dont think my boobs look  that  big.  Ive never been flat and Im not ever going to have Pamela Anderson super-tits, but a C sounds more like me than a D.  Maybe I should rethink this gotta drop some weight before my brothers wedding thing?  Im just trippin off girl stuff.  Scuse me.  Somewhere in this world someone will worship my breastesses (B, C or D cup) and appreciate that I pay top dollar for my bras.  And hey, at least Im all natural!  (Mwahaha!)  Moving on  The Hyphen party.  Sigh.  Me having the experience of putting on all sorts of events, I am always prepared for last minute everything to go wrong.  And everything DID go wrong, but the party went onand I looked cute (cuteness is all that matters, right?) in my new outfit.  I was tugging at my top all night, but at least my boobs (it's all about my boobs, isn't it?) looked good, and Adrienne did my makeup.  Talk about hotness on Hyphen staff--all of us (staff is like 90% female) were cute.  At least I felt cute for a little bit.  Whether or not I really was cute, is relative.  But I think I shall invest in my own DJ set-up so I can not only mess around with records, but have my own equipment for DJ emergencies (to avoid all the last minute calling of DJs to bring needles or slipmats because the club didnt provide that shit).  But enough of that.  Blah.  I drove my cousins Johanna, Jamie and Jeremy back to San Diego on Sunday (I flew back to SF late Sunday night).  It was my first time to do that drive (as the driver) from the Bay Area.  I did the drive in 7 hours, doing like 85-90 (at times 95).  The three youngsters slept in the car the whole trip.  I drank an energy drink (I forget what it was called, but it was half the size of a Red Bull, and tasted like a Sprite), a cup of coffee, and then (later on) half a Red Bull.  Didnt feel tired at all during the drive, though at times I felt like my heart was going to burst out of my chest.  I stopped in Bakersfield, to visit Mamas grave.  It was my first time to be back in Bakersfield since her ashes were buried in May.  I bought her a card and two bouquets of flowers.  I had barely spotted the headstone to her grave and I started bawling.  It was like at the mortuary chapel when we had her Last Mass/viewingmy cousins and I were the first ones to arrive and I only made it halfway down the aisle towards Mamas open casket, when I started bawling.  For some reason I cant talk to Mama out loud, like what I have to say to her is private (not that talking to her out loud or in general makes me feel silly).  I talk to Mama in my head and hope that she hears me.  I sat next to her grave, brushing the dirt off the headstone and arranging the flowers, talking to her in my head.  It really got to me that on the headstone, next to her name was my dads.  I dont want to have to think about another death for at least 15 years.  In any case, I was all spoiled from Thursday to Sunday.  I had a rental car, because my car didnt get fixed til Sunday.  My cousins and I were mobbing around in a white Chevy Trailblazer.  I thought itd be about the same size as my Mitsubishi Montero Sport, but it was HUGE.  Im really proud that I was able to maneuver the Trailblazer and its 270-horse power engine.  I truly felt like a shrimpy Asian girl who could barely see over the dashboard (Im just a centimeter shy of 53)driving a big-ass car is like my Napoleon complex or some shit.  I like SUVs, even though I know theyre not gas efficient.  I grew up in white suburbia and my first car was my moms minivan, so anything smaller than a Toyota Camry just wont do for moi.  Driving the rental car made me realize how old and uncool my car is, even though its a 1998 model.  I was like, Keyless entry?  DOPE!  CD player?  OhmyfreakingGOD!  My car doesnt even have power locks or windows, because I was cheap and got standard everything.  But now standard  IS  keyless entry, power locks/windows, a CD player, etc.  Yeah, I cannot wait to get a new car.  I have other bills to take care of first.  Enough babble.  This girls got work to do.  Ugh.
My Neck, My Back   (7/14 note: I wrote this yesterday afternoon, with the intention of uploading it right away, but I got distracted and ended up saving it as a draft.)   Sheesh.  The fact that I am still recovering from my weekend (make that my whole week) must be a testament to how old Im getting.  I know Im only 25 (going on 26, come September), but  Shit.  My back and neck still hurt, though not as bad as on Sunday.  Lately Ive been having neck and back painif that doesnt scream old, then I dont know what does.  I dont know if the cause is any of the following: bigger boobs (from weight gain), bad posture, or sleeping in a bad position.  But the pain can be seriously debilitating.  When its really bad, Ill feel sore for 2-4 days and I cant lean forward more than a 45-degree angle, I cant turn my head, and sudden, jerky movements cause me pain.   Aray ko , for real.    Anyhow.  Flew down to San Diego out of SFO early Wednesday morning (last week).  Got picked up by my cousin Aurens boyfriend and then dropped off at Auntie Erlings and Uncle Johnnys.  I got fed, watched TFC (The Filipino Channel) variety shows for a bit, and napped for like 2 hours, cozy in clean linens that used to be mine.  When Im at Auntie Erlings, Auntie Tetens, or Auntie Babys houseI always spot some knick-knack, blanket/throw pillow, or piece of furniture that used to belong to my family (my mom).  When my dad and I were preparing for Mamas death, we agreed that although I would inherit the house, my brother would move in and live there until he got married next year.  So Daddy and I put stuff into storage.  The things I didnt want/need, I gave to my aunties.  Whenever I visit any of my aunties Im always thinking, Hey, I recognize that!  When I was younger, all my cousins got my hand-me-downs (like this pink Huffy banana seat bike I used to love), so in a way Im glad all of Mamas things are still in the family (didnt get thrown away).  I spent a little time with my dad at Auntie Tetens before he went back to his hotel (when youre old like my dad, and its not basketball season anymore, you dont bother to stay up past 9:30 PM).  We ate  sinigang  (a seafood stew flavored with tamarind) and my dad lectured me for like 10 minutes about emailing him, or calling my aunties if I need anything while hes in Japan. Afterwards, my cousins (Jamie and Johanna) and I went over to our other cousin (Warren)s house in Chula Vista.  I should call him  Kuya  (big brother) Warren, huh?  (I hope Warren doesnt mind that I dont call him  kuya .)  Anyhow.  Warrens mom and my dad are cousins, so I dunno what that makes Warren and me, but Ill say cousins to keep it simple.  Its all Ednalino blood.  Warrens actually closer to my brothers age (early 30s) and his younger brother (Dave) and I used to play together when our families were stationed in Virginia Beach in the mid-80s.  I remember we used to watch Captain Caveman and He Man on the USA Cartoon Express, and his mom (my Auntie Nenet) got me hooked on Bar None candy bars (I wish they still made those).  So yeah, if you havent figured it out already, I have a freaking huge family.  ON BOTH SIDES!  My dad is like the fourth oldest of ten; my mom was the oldest of (I think) 8.  Unfortunately I dont know my Pasig (moms) side very well, so when I talk about my cousins, I mean all my Ednalino cousins (in Cali [San Diego and Milpitas]; I have some cousins in Hawaii and Australia).    Because some of my cousins have kids, and some of their kids are starting to have kids, I think Im like a great aunt already.  Is that right?  Ive never been able to figure out how all that lineage stuff works.  For example, is Robby, my  Kuya  Dongs 19-year old son (an older cousin of mine), my nephew, or is he my second cousin?  Regardless, all the youngsters address me as  ate /big sister (ah-teh) anyhow.  Heaven forbid anyone calls ME auntie anytime soon.  Hell-fucking-no.  I didnt grow up close to my family on either side.  Partly because when my dad was in the Navy, we got transferred around a lot, but mostly because my mom didnt get along with her inlaws.  I saw my dads side every couple of years, after we moved back to California from Virginia in like 1989.  Before Mama passed away, the last time Id seen my dads side of the family was when I was 19when my  lola  (grandmother) died.  The last six weeks or so that Mama got really sick, up until she passed away, my dads family came by every weekend for almost a month straight.  Now were getting re-acquainted.  I feel like Im making up for lost time.    Sometimes I say thought-prayers in my head to Mama and I tell her that although I know she didnt get along with daddys sisters, I hope she isnt mad at me for turning to them in her absence.  I am always loyal, but I love my aunties too.  It literally takes all of them to equal one of her.  Considering the tumultuous relationship Mama had with her inlaws, I think Mama would find it funny and ironic to hear me admit this.  But its true, and I know she would agree.  I have cousins I havent met yet, and cousins whose names Im still trying to keep straight.  I have cousins nearing 50, and cousins still under 15.  Its weird for me to have to address people as  kuya  (big brother) and  ate  (big sister), and to be addressed as  Ate  Audrey.  When my cousin Auren called me  Ate  a few months ago, I didnt respond to her.  I didnt think she was talking to me because Im not used to being called that.  But now I like it.  Ednalino to me was always just my dad, my mom, my brother and me.  But now its this greater network of aunties and uncles and cousins, and being called  ate  makes me feel like I belong to a club.  I have crazy, loud aunties who cackle when they laugh, who have  bastos  (dirty) senses of humor; my uncles all kick it in the backyard, next to the barbecue grill, smoking too many cigarettes, drinking beer and Hennessey while eating  pulutan  (snacks); most of my younger cousins are girls and theyre all so HOT, Im jealous.  Anyhow, I have things to do, so until next time!  I am going to look at all the Hyphen anniversary pics online and I won't forward you the links because I am so not photogenic (but I swear I was cute that night!).
How cute.&nbsp; One of my former students, Fam Seng, IM'd me.&nbsp; She just got her first cell phone.&nbsp; (I was her mentor/tutor when she was 13.&nbsp; She'll be starting her senior year of high school in the fall.)&nbsp; I told her I'm moving back to the East Bay next week and she's excited like, 'Can we have sleepovers again?'&nbsp; (I used to have all my girls over for sleepovers--that's probably the only reason they liked me.)&nbsp; She's got her driver's permit and she claims she's taller than me now.  Makes me feel so old!  Last night I gave Yuki a ride home after the Hyphen general meeting.&nbsp; After I dropped her off she called me, telling me she left her phone in her car.&nbsp; To be sure, I called it and I heard the chime/ring, but it took me forever to figure out where in my car it was because it fell inbetween the passenger seat and the middle console.&nbsp; I met&nbsp;Yuki downtown&nbsp;and dropped her phone off earlier this afternoon.  After last night's meeting I had a quick talk with Donna, to touch base on what her next project/s will be and what kinds of things she'd like to work on.&nbsp; Donna was just recently voted onto staff, after being a 'fellow' (intern) for three/four months.&nbsp; She originally wanted to be on the Edit Team, but her background is in marketing, so she had a better 'fit' with Business Team.&nbsp; She was officially voted on as my 'assistant' (at least as far as marketing/publicity goes).&nbsp; It's strange--I've never had to manage anyone (not like this, at least).&nbsp; I tend to be a Control Freak who, as a result of her control-neuroses, spreads herself too thin.&nbsp; What I need to do, is give Donna the benefit of the doubt that she can complete whatever tasks I assign to her, and do them on deadline.&nbsp; I wear two hats for Hyphen, so when I'm busy with event crap, I need an assistant to pick up the slack with administrative duties for marketing/publicity projects.&nbsp; I should take Donna out for dinner/drinks every so often, so she doesn't feel like I'm just a Micro-Managing Taskmaster...  Blah.  I wrote Mel two checks last night--one to pay out the deposit to her outgoing roommate Barbara, and one for August rent made out to our landlord.&nbsp; It  hurt  me to part with that money; I kissed my two checks before I handed them to Mel.&nbsp; Like, 'Bye-bye money!'&nbsp; But a week from now I am out of Pacifica!&nbsp; I can't wait!&nbsp;  Tomorrow night&nbsp;a bunch of us will be hanging out with C.Fan (Chris Fan).&nbsp; Chris used to be with Hyphen, then&nbsp;he left for NYC for grad school.&nbsp; I hope&nbsp;when I drink tomorrow, I don't feel all funky like I did at Milk Wednesday.&nbsp;  Okay, have a good weekend.&nbsp;
White Men Cant Dance    &nbsp;  Trebuchet MS is my favorite font.&nbsp; Do normal people have favorite fonts?&nbsp; It used to be Verdana, but now I think it's too wide.&nbsp; I'm a dork.    &nbsp;  Hyphen freaking general meeting tonight.&nbsp; Do you KNOW how much I HATE general meetings?&nbsp; (At least we don't have much&nbsp;of a biz team anymore, so we&nbsp;haven't had a biz team meeting in months.)&nbsp; I wanted to ditch tonight&nbsp;and go to Alameda--to hang out with Tim, Geraldine, Nina, Rachel and Steve (I used to call them the '594 Kids'), to ride around in Tim's new boat.&nbsp; I hadn't kicked it with all those kids (as a group--I always see everyone separately) in a loooong time.    &nbsp;  But I realized that tonight is our 'post-mortem' (we go over and analyze) of our anniversary event and how can the Event Planner miss that?&nbsp; And then I also realized that I'm going to be moving in with the Editor In Chief next Thursday--there will be no missing of meetings or lying about something to do (when it's really just goofing off) from here on out.&nbsp; Mel will kick my ass, she's so hardcore!&nbsp; You don't wanna make her mad...&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; (Love ya, Mel!)    &nbsp;  Sigh.    &nbsp;  Anyhoo.    &nbsp;  Yesterday started out a bad day and ended with a fabulous Girls Night Out.  I checked my messages at the right time yesterday, because I got an email from my friend Marky about a party (his crew) Massive Selector was throwing at Milk for The Roots album release of  Tipping Point .&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasnt going to go; I was planning on going to this bar called Hush Hush tonight (after the Hyphen meeting), where Marky and my other friend Ren would be spinning.&nbsp; Then I thought, Why not go to Milk?&nbsp; So I called Adrienne and we were like, Are you going?&nbsp; Do you want to go?&nbsp; Then we were like, If you go, Ill go.&nbsp; So we both went.&nbsp; And Hatty came with.&nbsp;   It was good.&nbsp; I got to touch base with Erik (the owner of Milk), who Id been meaning to talk to forever, since Directions in Sound (it was at Milk this year).&nbsp; Right after the NAATA film festival ended, the following week I was in Bakersfield off and on til mid-May, so I never got to debrief with Erik about how he/we felt Directions In Sound went at Milk.&nbsp; And I want to talk to him about doing a birthday party/fundraiser in early October, too.  Erik was walking out and I was like, Hey! He stopped, smiled at me and said, Give me a hug!&nbsp; Hatty and Adrienne were like, Whoa, Audrey!&nbsp; You go, mama!&nbsp; (Eriks totally fly, but hes married with child.)&nbsp; Erik and I had a cigarette outside and we chatted a bit.&nbsp; He told me it was his birthday and I was like, Happy Birthday!&nbsp; How old are you?&nbsp; 30?&nbsp; 32?&nbsp; He was like, 33&nbsp; And so I said, The same age Jesus was when he was crucified.&nbsp; Erik was like, See, thats what Im talking about.&nbsp; It was such a random conversation that somehow ended up making sense.  Ade, Hatty and I started off the night with a round of Purple Hooters shots, on me.&nbsp; Then we posted in a booth along the wall, checking everyone out and grooving in our seats.&nbsp; Adrienne was like, If you see anyone cute, point them out and Ill rate them.&nbsp; The only guy I thought was sort of cute/interesting, was this stocky Filipino guy wearing a Zoo York shirt and a neat hat, who was really grooving/singing along to the reggae/dancehall that Rob was spinning.&nbsp; Adrienne gave him a 7 and then said, He looks like a nice person.&nbsp; He looks like he loves his mom very much.&nbsp; More randomness.  Hatty bought Ade and I Long Island Iced Teas.&nbsp; She didnt get a drink for herself because she saw the bartender grab like ten different liquors to make one Long Island, and it freaked her out.&nbsp; For good reason, toothat drink fucked me up.&nbsp; I was barely half-way when I started feeling like it was hard to breathe and my heart was beating faster.&nbsp; But I drank more and then stepped out to have a cigarette (fresh air).&nbsp; My tolerance is definitely not what it was just three or four months ago.  This band, I think they were called Alphabet Soup, played live and had two emcees and a DJ accompanying them.&nbsp; They were dope.&nbsp; They started playing when Ade, Hatty and I were in the ladies room, and I thought it was actually The Roots CD, but it was the bandthey were that good.&nbsp;   There was this weird South Asian (maybe Middle Eastern) guy who was trying to infiltrate our dancing threesome all night.&nbsp; Ade, Hatty and I started out dancing where the bar turns into the dancefloor.&nbsp; We moved closer to the stage and were just grooving, and this strange guy (holding a beer and exclaiming, Heeeeey!) tries to freak me from behind.&nbsp; When I turn towards Hatty, he then tries to freak Adrienne.&nbsp; Basically, whenever he came close to our group, hed try to freak all of us (one by one), or get in the middle of our dancing circle.&nbsp; At one point in the night, he was all, Heeey! and had one hand on mine and Hattys headsI thought he was going to like stroke our hair or pat us on the heads like puppies.&nbsp; RANDOM.&nbsp; The guy tried to freak all three of us when Ades friend Alex was watching, and so he started laughing and walking away.&nbsp; Adrienne grabbed his arm and made him stand by us.&nbsp; He was like, Thats why you need to bring someone to cock-block.&nbsp; I was joking around like, Thats my jobIm protecting these two, and he was like, You?&nbsp; Suuuure.&nbsp; Then he walked away again, leaving us near the crazy Heeeey! guy.&nbsp; So we went back to our original booth and sat there til we went home.  So like, whats up with all the seriously OLD WHITE GUYS who were in attendance?&nbsp; Adrienne says the event was posted up on Craigslist, so maybe thats a factor, but&nbsp; It was Play that funky music, whiteboy night or some shit.&nbsp; White men cant dance, Im sorry.    Geez.&nbsp; When I finish this, that means I'm off to my meeting.&nbsp; I don't wanna go...
Adjustment Period     &nbsp;   Since my weekend post about karaoke, I've been having this great exchange over email with Todd about fun songs to sing.&nbsp; All I have to say is, 'We like the cars, the cars that go boom!'     &nbsp;   I almost forgot to mention that when Mel, Sorcha, Vette and I did karaoke last weekend, I tried my hand at 'I Just Wanna Love Ya' by Jay-Z.&nbsp; Yes, folks, I tried to be both Jay-Z and Pharrell in the same song.&nbsp; It's quite hard when you have to be all, '...only if you ride nice dick' and then be all, 'Gimme that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff.'     &nbsp;   Anyhow.     &nbsp;   It's only Wednesday, but I've been having a hard week.&nbsp; I noticed today, as I drove around running errands after work, that I really just wanted to cry.&nbsp; I was in rush hour traffic and all I wanted to do was stop my car, get out and sit in the backseat and cry in the privacy of tinted windows.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I was thinking about this joke Daddy played on Mama a few months ago.&nbsp; He was crouched down, tying her shoe for her, and he started doing the 'ocho-ocho' dance.&nbsp; Unless you're Filipino, that's probably not funny.&nbsp; So far every day this week I've felt like crying because I miss Mama--because I think of something about her that I miss.     &nbsp;   I'm really scared for my birthday to come.&nbsp; Mama was always the first one to call me up and greet me.&nbsp; Mama's birthday card was always the first to arrive.&nbsp; I'm scared for Christmas to come--I'm still beating myself up over not spending Christmas in Bakersfield last year.&nbsp; I feel so guilty that Mama spent Christmas alone (with my  lola /grandmother) and I had an orphan's Christmas with my friends, because I figured I'd go home for New Year's anyhow.     &nbsp;   Everyone keeps telling me that this first year without Mama will be all about adjusting to her absence.&nbsp; I wish I didn't have to adjust period.
Golden  &nbsp;  Woke up this morning to the TV blaring, because I feel asleep with it on last night.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; For some reason the TV was on ESPN (what&nbsp;did I watch last night?) and it was some final series for pool at a casino/resort&nbsp;in Connecticut.&nbsp; The two dueling it out, to move on to the final round, were both Filipino.&nbsp; I&nbsp;didn't have my glasses on, but I heard the names Efren and Bustamante and I&nbsp;shot up in bed to see if my Filipino Radar is still on point.&nbsp;  Of course it is.   &nbsp;  Anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the best moment Friday afternoon.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After work I decided to treat myself to an ice cream cone.&nbsp; I was just sitting on a stool, watching people walk by, when the new Jill Scott song Golden comes on.&nbsp; Im licking up my ice cream, grooving along, and then I bite into the coneit tasted like fried chicken.  &nbsp;  I dont know why, but I thought that was such a profound moment.&nbsp;  My ice cream cone tasted like fried chicken. &nbsp; Every once in a while I have my own strange semi-  American Beauty , plastic-bag-twirling-around-in-the-wind sort of moments that I think are really profound in their silliness.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   You're one weird-ass girl, Audrey.   &nbsp;  I got a call from Uncle Johnny this weekend.&nbsp; Now that Mama is gone and Daddy is in another country, I feel pretty lonely at times.&nbsp; It was nice of Uncle Johnny to call, just to say Hi.&nbsp; He put Auntie Erling on the phone and she addressed me as Audeng (sounds like awww dang!).&nbsp; My parents used to call me thatmostly Mama did.&nbsp; It makes me sad to think that Mamas not here to call me that nickname anymore.  &nbsp;  There are a lot of things about Mama that I miss.&nbsp; I still cant believe that shes gone sometimesit still feels like a strange dream that I should wake up from.&nbsp; And sometimes I feel guilty because I dont feel sad 24-7 like I did the first two weeks after she passed away.&nbsp; Like I feel as if I should be super-depressed and sad and crying all the time to properly mourn her.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I know theres no blueprint to the mourning processeveryone goes through the motions in their own way, on their own time.&nbsp; The first two weeks after I returned from Bakersfield, after Mama passed away, I didnt want to go out or talk to anyone.&nbsp; I wanted to cry all the time, and I probably cried at least once a day in those first two weeks.&nbsp; I was an anti-social hermit girl.&nbsp; I went to work and went home and watched TV til I fell asleep.&nbsp; Then I got busy with work and Hyphen and I was hanging out all the time.&nbsp; But as of last Sunday that phase ended, so now Im sort of reverting to the watching-TV-til-I-pass-out phase.&nbsp; I don't like having time to feel sad, and my sadness manifesting in really unhealthy ways (neck pains, insomnia, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I hope Daddys coping better.&nbsp;
Axl Rose + Muppet/Fraggle = Melissa Hung  &nbsp;  Instead of going to see Spiderman 2 with Yvette last night, we did karaoke in Japantown with Mel and her friend (visiting from Houston) Sorcha (I hope I spelled that right).  &nbsp;  I met Mel and Sorcha in Oakland for a craft fair.&nbsp; I get tired of that whole dirty punk rock/artist scene real quick, but I came away with cool things (a turtle-shaped pin, a flower pin, and a pair of dangly earrings).&nbsp; Then we hung out in Lake Merritt, walking in and out of (overpriced) shops while drinking our iced coffees from Peets.&nbsp; Yvette met us at 7 PM for Cambodian food at Battambang, a restaurant I really like, that I had sworn off for about a year.&nbsp; (Its half a block away from the art gallery a certain person [I dont get along with anymore, who is an ex-friend and ex-roommate] works [or used to work] at.&nbsp; Dont ask.)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After dinner, we killed time at Mels (my soon-to-be home), trying to coordinate with people to join us for karaoke.&nbsp; More people, more fun, right?&nbsp; Melissa was like, We should call Todd!&nbsp; But then she was like, But Todds really busy; he probly wouldnt come anyway.&nbsp; I figure, Todds old (haha, Todd) and who in their right mind would drive all the way up to SF from San Jose just for karaoke anyhow?&nbsp; (Oh, but Todd is someone I would love to do drunken karaoke with.&nbsp; I know hed be fun!&nbsp; Oliver Wangs on my Karaoke Wish List, too!)  &nbsp;  While at Mels, Adrienne kept texting me, and I texted her back (I know, thats just so Filipino of us).&nbsp; But then I got impatient, and at the urging of Mel, Vette and Sorcha, I finally called.&nbsp; Its just so hard to coordinate among so many people.&nbsp; There was some party Stef was going to, that she and Adrienne wanted us to go to also, and the theme was to wear Puma and Adidas.&nbsp; But our foursome (Mel, Vette, Sorcha and moi) wasnt in the socializing mood.&nbsp; We wanted to be clique-ish (inside joke for Mel, Stef, Adrienne, me and a couple other Hyphenators) and not have to make nice with strangers.&nbsp; So we crossed the bridge to have a round of drinks at Rohan (really cool soju bar) then karaoked our little hearts out for an hour and a half.  &nbsp;  Ohmygod!&nbsp; Melissa is the Hair Metal Karaoke Queen!&nbsp; I thought my friend Pete did the best Axl Rose, but Melissa fucking rocks because shes a girl and she totally belts it out.&nbsp; I mean, I already adore Melissa, but now I have added respect for her karaoke skills.&nbsp; She did Skid Row (18 &amp; Life), Bon Jovi (You Give Love A Bad Name) and Guns N Roses (Welcome To The Jungle).&nbsp; Melissa was scoring really high, getting 93s and 98s.&nbsp; The song where she really kicked ass (18 &amp; Life) and shouldve scored 100, the machine scored her as a 0.&nbsp; I think she broke the karaoke machine with all of her talent.  &nbsp;  I was upset that the two songbooks we were choosing tunes from didnt have any of my signature songs.&nbsp; No When I Think of You (Janet Jackson), no Stay (Lisa Loeb), no Always (Atlantic Starr), no Tell Me Something Good (Rufus &amp; Chaka Khan).&nbsp; I had to make do and rock some Genie in a Bottle by Christina Aguilera, Never Gonna Give You Up (Rick Astleyinvoking the spirit of Gary Chou!) and Careless Whisper (George Michaeldedicated to Yuki).  &nbsp;  We ended the night with a group songcant remember if it was Journey or Foreigner but it was the I wanna know what love is song.&nbsp; We were all just screaming into the mics, we didnt care.&nbsp; On the drive home, we were reeling off what BASIC songs the karaoke binders didnt have (that they should have), and what songs wouldve been fun to do as a group.&nbsp; I saw Bohemian Rhapsody (Queen) in the binder, but was too intimidated to program it.&nbsp; Dont frontyou KNOW that would be fun to do.&nbsp; It must be that Filipino performer-mimic gene in me, but I loves me some karaoke.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Alright now, I gotta go return some impulse buys from Bath &amp; Body Works.&nbsp; (Who needs 3 scented lotions, even if they are $3.33 each?)
Food Orgasm at Kenkoys  &nbsp; I've been getting&nbsp;complaints the past week that people can't/couldn't comment to my posts unless they&nbsp;had Blogs themselves.&nbsp; I fixed that, so if you're not a Blog member, you can post anonymously.&nbsp; I like the comments people have been forwarding to me, but I also think it'd be more fun to share them with whoever else reads this.&nbsp; Everyone (so far as I know) who reads my&nbsp;blog (I can&nbsp;only think of like&nbsp;five or six people who I know read it) is nice.&nbsp; :) &nbsp; Anyhow.&nbsp; I had the best breakfast/brunch in the whole wide world this morning.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Im always on this quest for good Filipino food because I havent had a chance to eat it on the regular in about five years (since my mom first got cancer).&nbsp; I guess its sort of a quest to recapture the food from my happy childhood, but more just seeking out a good Filipino food surrogate.&nbsp; You knowcomfort.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Ive eaten my dads cooking and my aunties cookingbut nobody cooks the way my mom did. &nbsp;If Mama was still alive, she wouldve been able to kick your moms ass in the kitchen with a  sandok  and  palayok , word up.  &nbsp;  I think I just might have found my most favorite Filipino caf/restaurant.&nbsp; And thats quite a thing to say, considering that I generally turn my nose at Filipino food establishments.&nbsp; I think a lot of Filipinos might feel the same waythat you shouldnt bother eating Filipino food at  turo-turo  (literally point-point where the food sits pre-cooked, stewing under a heatlamp) mom-n-pop joints.  &nbsp;  This morning I had longsilog (pork sausage and eggs over garlic fried rice).&nbsp; It was super-duper nummies.&nbsp; Kenkoys dont mess aroundthey cook your food to order.&nbsp; They even make the food all nice and pretty on the plate. &nbsp;Thats always been one of my biggest pet peeves with Filipino restaurants/cuisine (the food tastes good, but theres no effort in presentation like at Thai or Vietnamese restaurants).  &nbsp;  The moment I bit into my food it was like the best first bite Ive had in a long-ass time.&nbsp; I seriously had an orgasmic experience, tears couldve fallen down my cheeks.&nbsp; My food looked better than the picture on the menu.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  If anyone wants to go get breakfast (served all day) at Kenkoys in Pacifica with me, just let me know and Im totally there.&nbsp; And it doesnt hurt that Anton, the owners son who works the counter most of the time, is hella fine!&nbsp; He can be mybabydaddy, and I dont usually like Filipino guys unless theyre exceptional!  &nbsp;  I need to try their  halo-halo ,   turon ,  sinigang  and  lechon  (cant be Filipino and not eat pork!) before I wholeheartedly give them the title of Audreys Favorite Filipino Restaurant.&nbsp; But I already know their breakfasts are good, as are their  caldereta  (not cooked with goat, but beef) and  kare-kare  dishes.  &nbsp;Okay, Im done raving.&nbsp; Wah!
Bittersweet   NOTE: I was trying to upload this entry yesterday, but my computer was acting all screwy and it instead got saved to my Blog drafts.   My bad.  Second entry in one day, but  Just so much going on.  Must comment.  I went into work this morning to tie up some loose ends since tomorrow is technically my last day.  Id actually say today was my last day, but Im going into the office (turn in my keys and pack up my desk) and Im also getting paid for the day.  I made the decision this morning to just be a full-time student this semester.  Im taking five classes (14 units), and I havent been in school for about a year. I really need to ease into the academic environment again and not have any time-consuming outside distractions (except for Hyphen and small freelance projects on the side [Ive got some things planned, just you wait and see]).  I asked my dad for his input, because hes in charge of a trust he and my mom set up before she died.  My brother and I are getting a small (I stress small) amount of money automatically deposited into our bank accounts monthly.  Our inheritance isnt crazy, so dont think Im some rich/spoiled wannabe  haciendera  because I can afford to do/buy things I couldnt before, and I inherited my moms jewelry and land in the Philippines.  Her jewelry/things and land are things I hold onto for sentimental valuebecause they are whats left of her and I have a right to them.  But as far as actual money, I am  kuripot /frugal (stingy) where it counts (and generous, I hope!) and I am researching avenues of investing.   Lets just say that because of all this, I finally have the opportunity to be a full-time studentto finish the coursework left for me to get my undergraduate degree.  Daddy said I should just be a full-time student not only for this semester but until I finish.  I have three more semesters left (including this fall).  Im all for playing the part of full-time student fall semester, but Im not so sure about spring and next fall.  I could get antsy about not having something to balance out Hyphen and studying.  I like working, only because Ive found what I like to do and what Im good at.  But I feel like I made a really HUGE decision today.  I think I deserve it.  I made a lot of sacrifices when Mama got sick; I put off school every time my parents needed me to be at home.  At the time I resented it, but in retrospect I wouldnt trade that time for anything else in the world.  When we found out Mama only had months left back in March, she made me promise to get my undergrad degreeto stop putting it off after she passed away.  Out of every promise I ever made to her, this is the most important.  I dont feel any regret, nor do I feel behind anymore.  I used to get down on myself about hitting my mid-20s and not being done with college yet.  I almost gave up on the thought that I could ever go to grad school.  I even used to resent Mama for being sick, because of all the wasted time I took off to take care of her.  But now that shes gone, I realize how young and lucky I am.  The only bittersweet thing is that Mama wont be there on my graduation day.  (Typing that just made me want to cry.  Wow.)  Anyhow, gotta go.  Gotta reserve a rental car for Saturday, then head to Oakland to pick up the keys to my new home from Mel.  Then were going out for dinner.  Yay!
Stef Says I Talk Funny  Watching:  CB4  on Comedy Central&nbsp; (This film is almost as funny as  Fear of a Black Hat   Last nights screening of  Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle  was crazy.&nbsp; I was in line with Yvette, Adrienne and Ades friend John.&nbsp; As it was, I didnt think wed make it in, much less Mel and Hatty (who were still outside).&nbsp; Vette, Ade, John and I sat in the 3rd row (center), so I was surprised that Mel and Hatty got in and sat in front of us.&nbsp; Mel pulled rank and was like, Im the editor of Hyphen and were one of the sponsors!&nbsp; (Insert evil laugh here.)&nbsp; Im too afraid to pull rank and drop names to get my wayunless its at my own event and I have to put someone in their place.&nbsp; (I always get people who dont realize who I am, claiming to be important and on the guest list.&nbsp; My philosophy is, If you really were important, youd already be on the guest list.)  Back to the film.&nbsp; Just as I came out of  Coffee & Cigarettes  wanting a  yosi /smoke really bad, I had a craving for White Castle.&nbsp; If youre wondering what I thought, the film wasnt that bad.&nbsp; It was better than I expected and it was funny (low brow humor).  I saw Scott.&nbsp; At the screening I saw/ran into a lot of people I know through community (the Asian American media/arts community).&nbsp; I waved Scott over to where I was sitting and we chatted.&nbsp; Initially I was in Hyphen mode, wanting to get the ball rolling on this arrangement Hyphen made with APAture/Kearny Street Workshop (the organization Scott works for), but Scott sidetracked and brought up my mom.&nbsp; I think he heard from Truong (my friend, his boss) about my mom passing away.  Scott had a hard time looking me in the eye and I think it was because he felt uncomfortable talking about death.&nbsp; But I realized that I wasnt uncomfortable anymore.&nbsp; Now that its been two and a half months since Mama died, its easier for me to talk about it and to hear other people tell me theyre sorry.&nbsp; In the first month after Mama passed away, I just wanted everyone in the world to know how heartbroken I washow much her death changed (and would change) my life (and my dads and brothers lives).&nbsp; I wanted to yell and throw shit in an angry fiteven punch walls and people.  And I am sorry to say that I went through a couple of weeks where I was angry and hurt by certain friends, if they hadnt told me they felt sorry for me or offered shoulders to cry on.&nbsp; But I understand that everyone who knows me and knows about the 4+ years I dealt with my mom having cancer, and now her deaththey all empathize with me regardless of if theyve been vocal about it.&nbsp; Its that whole more than words clich.&nbsp; Sometimes people dont know what to say, so they dont say anything at all.&nbsp; I cant say that silence is golden in this case, but I understand.   Anyhow.&nbsp; I totally forgot that my friend Stef was in Boston.&nbsp; I brought a gift for her to the screening, thinking shed be there.&nbsp; I ran into her boyfriend Paul and pawned her gift onto him since I was tired of holding it.&nbsp; I hope Stef gets the present okay, because after the screening I didnt see Paul holding the box anymorethats an expensive gift.&nbsp; (I saw this fanny pack thing at Sunhee Moon and I wanted to buy it for Stef, but I didnt imagine itd be real leather and cost $91.) &nbsp;But Stef is definitely worth it; if you met her youd think so, too.  Moving on.&nbsp; Do I talk funny?&nbsp; As in, do I have an accent?&nbsp; Ive been told that Californians have an international sort of accentthat because Cali is so multi-cultural, there really isnt any noticeable native accent (except of course the Valley Girl/Surfer Dude).&nbsp; I once dated a Canadian who told me I had an accent when I said certain things; I thought he was trippin because he said aboot.&nbsp; Saturday night Stef pointed out to me that sometimes I pronounce my flat As with an A thats inbetween the A in cat and the A in spa.&nbsp;   I told her its probably just because I grew up all over (Navy brat), so how I speak is a mix of all the places Ive lived (accents Ive heard).&nbsp;  Or , it could be my residual FOBby Filipino-ness.&nbsp; Sometimes I FOB out (say things in broken English or with a slight Filipino accent), especially after Ive spent a lot of time with my family.&nbsp; Plus, I make an effort to articulate Spanish and Tagalog (and any other ethnic) words with the correct pronunciation.&nbsp; I dont like to Americanize (mutilate) ethnic words, as much as possible.  &nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; Gotta meet Yuki and Neda for lunch.&nbsp; Im hopping on BARTI am getting reacquainted with BART since Ill be a commuter (bridge &amp; tunnel) once I move to Oakland.
Take That, Rewind It Back  Wow.&nbsp; I was given notice yesterday that I am being laid off at my nonprofit admin job.&nbsp; Budget cuts--the money that's allocated to pay me is instead going to hire/pay someone with more tech experience.&nbsp; (I was a 'membership services assistant' who processed memberships and did data entry.&nbsp; Our servers were always crashing and I ain't no techie, so...you do the math.)&nbsp; And then my 'contract' with the PR firm is up in a few weeks.  I'm back to being unemployed.&nbsp; But then again, that's okay.&nbsp; I just paid for my classes for fall semester and I'm taking a full load--14 units (5 classes).&nbsp; It's been a long-ass time since I was in a position where I had the time/could afford to take a full load of classes.&nbsp; For the first time I'm not hurting for money, either.&nbsp; I'm debating on whether or not I should look for part-time work, or just be a full-time student fall semester--classes start in about 3 weeks.  Anyhow.  Hyphen is a sponsor for tonights sneak preview of  Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle .&nbsp; I will be&nbsp;at the Metreon&nbsp;to represent with&nbsp;other Hyphenators and my friend Yvette. &nbsp;Surprisingly, Ebert and whoever-that-skinny-guy-is gave the film 'two thumbs up.'&nbsp; I am not sure what to think of&nbsp;Hyphen sponsoring an Asian American version of  Dude, Wheres My Car? .&nbsp; I mean, it stars the MILF guy (John Cho from  American Pie )&nbsp; And then I read an article about  She Hate Me , the upcoming Spike Lee film.&nbsp; I cant wait to see it (along with  Garden State ).&nbsp; My most favorite film of all time, is  Crooklyn .&nbsp; Oh, and I saw  Napoleon Dynamite  last week!&nbsp; You have to see it!  This morning I woke up with Bob Marleys Could You Be Loved in my head.&nbsp; I cannot remember the dream, but I remember that song was in my dream.&nbsp; Its a refreshing change, considering that my mind has been bombarded with Usher and radio music I dont especially like.&nbsp; (Take that, rewind it back/Urshur got the voice to make the booty go)&nbsp; Yesterday I had Juvenile (Ungh!&nbsp; I like it like thatslow motion for me) in my head.&nbsp; Last week I had Its Raining Men and Toxic (by Britney Spears) in my head.&nbsp; I was told that one surefire way to get annoying songs out of your head, is to start singing Viva Las Vegas.  After leaving the admissions office at school, I went to the mall to buy some more makeup.&nbsp; I've been a Makeup Whore since Mama passed away--just buying and buying.&nbsp; It seems the older I get, the more makeup I feel I need to use to cover up the signs of aging.&nbsp; I know Im only 25, but since I was about 20 Ive felt so much older than my friends who are around my age solely because of the experiences Ive had and the things Ive had to do for myself.&nbsp; In my early 20s I went through a period where I would get four hours of sleep a night, work, take late afternoon/night/weekend classes, and/or work a second job/internship, and party it up just as hard.&nbsp; I cant do that anymorethe age and fatigue show on my face.&nbsp; Hence, more makeup.&nbsp; Now I have to wear under eye concealer and use anti-wrinkle cream.&nbsp; The beauty regimen gets more complicated with age.&nbsp; I remember when I was in my teens, I thought 25 was old.&nbsp; Now that Im 25 and getting closer to 30/40, 30/40 seem pretty damn young.  Oh yeah.&nbsp; When I was speaking to Donna (my assistant for Hyphen) after the general meeting last week, she interrupted me while I was in the middle of saying something.&nbsp; She was like, Oh my God, Im just so mesmerized by your eyes.&nbsp; I played it off and got all diva, like, Oh, thank you! and batted my eyelashes.&nbsp; I sort of felt validated because that same afternoon I went to Sephora to buy this eye shadow base and I re-did my makeup before the Hyphen general meeting.&nbsp; I felt like the $18 I spent was well worth the money.&nbsp;   If you only knew how much money Ive spent at Sephora and MAC since May, youd bug out.&nbsp; Those joints are like candy stores to me.&nbsp; And I just love having the girls who work the counter, apply makeup on me--eye shadow is the only way you'll get my ass to wear pink.  Now I'm going to go walk around and feel cute because I'm all did up, wearing my new corduroy blazer, low-cut top&nbsp;and tight-ass black pants.&nbsp; HOLLA!
Vegans Arent Balut-iful  Didnt get a chance to meet Mel and her family for dinner last night.&nbsp; I got stuck at the Laundromat waiting for my clothes because the first dryer I used was broken and I had to wait for one that worked.&nbsp; Boo.&nbsp; I felt bad because I know Mel wanted someone to save her from her parents and keep her company.  Anyway.&nbsp; When Mels friend Sorcha was in town, the three of us shared a vegan banana nut muffin.&nbsp; We each had a small taste and then it got tossed in the trash.&nbsp; The other day, I was curious and tried vegan macaroni & cheese.&nbsp; It, too, got tossed in the trash.&nbsp; I guess its safe to say that vegan = tasteless.  My freshman year of college, I was a vegetarian.&nbsp; I went home one time and my mom fed me  pancit  (stir fried noodles) with chicken (saying, Just a little bit wont hurt).&nbsp; From that moment on I was a rehabilitated carnivore.&nbsp; I will never again give up meat.  I like to eat my pho with rare beef, tripe, and tendons.&nbsp; Thats the only way to do it.&nbsp; I dont mind organ meat.&nbsp; You cant be Asian and not eat pork or some kind of organ meat.&nbsp; Asians do not waste any part of the animal.  I like to eat  papaitan  (a stew made with bile and tripe) and  kare-kare  (oxtail, tripe and veggies, stewed in a peanut sauce).&nbsp; One of my best friends, Yvette, is half  Kapampangan  (her dad is from  Pampanga  province).&nbsp;  Kapampangans  are known for their  longanisa  (sweet pork sausage) and discriminating appetites.&nbsp; Yvette picks on me like, Youre half  Ilocana , thats why you eat some nasty shit.&nbsp; But Yvette likes  lengua  (tongue), and I refuse to eat anything that can taste me back.&nbsp; So were even.&nbsp; ( Day, magkapareho din tayo, di ba? )  Growing up, I was disgusted by how my mom and dad would eat shrimp.&nbsp; Theyd pluck the head off first, and suck the brains out, claiming, Its de best part!&nbsp; My dad would suck the eyeballs of fish.&nbsp; He eats fish heads fast and clean like a pro.&nbsp; Nowadays when I visit my Auntie Baby and we eat shrimp  kamayan  style (with your hands, like a peasant), I suck on shrimp heads too.&nbsp; I wouldnt say its the best part, but its definitely where the flavor is.&nbsp;   I also used to be really horrified at the thought of eating  balut .&nbsp;  Balut  is a fertilized duck egg that is 17-19 days old.&nbsp; Its supposed to be an aphrodesiac (makes men strong/virile), and is generally eaten as  pulutan  (a snack) with beer.&nbsp; In May my Auntie Thelma flew out from Australia to help Daddy and I take care of Mama until she passed away.&nbsp; We stayed up into the night, taking shifts.&nbsp; Since Daddy and I didnt sleep much, Auntie Thelma had me buy  balut .&nbsp; Id always wanted to try it, but was too chicken shit (no pun intended) to try, so Auntie Thelma finally taught me how.   Balut s not that bad.&nbsp; The key is to not scrutinize what youre eating (so eat as fast as you can).&nbsp; And to use salt.&nbsp; Basically you boil the duck egg, crack the pointy top just a little, and sip out the  sisiw  (fluid).&nbsp; Then you peel off/down the shell as you eat.&nbsp; If youre lucky enough to get  balut  thats 17 days old, then theres no biting into barely formed beaks, feathers and feet.&nbsp; It really tastes like chickenjust slightly funkier. &nbsp;I believe I am a true Filipino now, now that Ive tried  balut .&nbsp; Back in the day, Taek would say hes more Filipino than me because hed eaten  balut  and I hadnt.&nbsp; Hed say hes more  balut -iful than me. &nbsp;(Not anymore Korean Boy!)
Cigarettes, Lubrication & Scandal  Saw Chris Fan last night.&nbsp; It was good to see him.&nbsp;   At the party, all of us Hyphen folk were being clique-y and not socializing outside of our circle.&nbsp; Ade, Mel, Stef, Hatty, and I were kicking it on the deck out back the whole night, talking to Albert, Alex, Jason and Paul (guys involved with Hyphen, the guys who came with us).&nbsp;   I got pretty tipsy (after a Jell-o shot and rum & coke).&nbsp; One point in the night I told Adrienne and Hatty, Watch this.&nbsp; I wanted to show off.&nbsp; Drink in hand, I sauntered up to Jason, tugged on his shirt and yelled, GIMME CIGARETTE!&nbsp; (It was the second time Id done that to him that night.)&nbsp; He was like, Damn, here you go!&nbsp; What are you?&nbsp; Korean or something?&nbsp; That got Hatty riled up, What are you trying to say about Koreans?&nbsp; But I was just trying to prove a pointJason takes my shit, even though Im a foot shorter than him and he can stomp on me.&nbsp; Were like the Odd Couple.&nbsp; And I like to be loud/obnoxious sometimes when Im drunk, because I can play it off and still be cute.  I am so excited.&nbsp; Im making a trip to Australia and the Philippines (possibly Thailand and Malaysia) next summer.&nbsp; It looks like Hattys going to be my traveling companion!!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; Well have so much fun!&nbsp; Im trying to convince Adrienne to go.&nbsp; I want Mel to come with, if she has some vacation time to spare.&nbsp; Yay some more!  Mr. Todd Inoue is serious about his karaoke.&nbsp; This (and the fact that Todd carries around this really cool Japan Airlines bag) makes Todd my new superhero over O-Dub.&nbsp; (Todd, this is where we make rice eating gestures and dance  kulintang , haha.&nbsp; I loved your article on Chad Hugo--especially that picture of you with the 'Hey Chad, I'm Filipino too!' sign.)&nbsp;   Mel and I want to organize Karaoke Night for Hyphen staff.&nbsp; My friend Brent used to be involved as a consultant, but now hes more active.&nbsp; I remember him asking me, So, who are all the cool kids?&nbsp; Who do you hang out with on staff?&nbsp; Thats when I realized that new staff and interns probably think some of us are clique-y (which we are)which means we need STAFF BONDING.&nbsp; What better way than drunken karaoke?&nbsp; (Plus, Mel, Mia, Stef, and I just want to saaang.)&nbsp; This also reminds me that its time we had a staff retreat, too.&nbsp;   I finally watched The Surreal Life on VH1.&nbsp; Friday night I watched all episodes as I packed up 80% of my belongings in preparation for my move to Oakland.&nbsp; Ron Jeremy, bighairypornstar, has a pet turtle.&nbsp; Thats all I have to say about him.&nbsp; Trishelle, from Real World Las Vegas?&nbsp; I cant stand to watch herit makes me want to get violent (dropkick her in her neck, smack her upside her head, pull her hair out, etc.).&nbsp; Its so funny how I can feel so strongly about someone, based on how they show portrays them.&nbsp;   OMG!   My landlord finally found someone to occupy my room when I move.&nbsp; In the midst of packing up my bathroom I realized that, when he was showing my room to prospective tenants, if anyone happened to look at my bottom shelf of toiletries and beauty products, they wouldve seen this trial size bottle of Astroglide I got from Good Vibrations.&nbsp; (Laughing my ass off.)&nbsp;  SCANDALOUS!   On to something more mundane&nbsp; Can I just say how much I love  tsinilas /flip-flops?&nbsp; I already have that summer flip-flop tan on my feet and I love it.  Okay, gotta go to Home Depot then rush back home and shower because I'm meeting Melissa and her family (her parents and little brother are in town from Houston) for dinner.&nbsp; Melissa's not my girlfriend or boyfriend, but meeting a friend's/soon-to-be roommate's parents is a big deal.&nbsp; Eek.
Superfreaky, YOW!      I was stuck in traffic on the 580, on my way back home from Fry's in Fremont--I heard on the radio that Rick James was found dead at his home this morning.  Died in his sleep of natural causes.  As soon as I got home I got online to read about it on the news.      I wonder what Dave Chappelle has to say about it...bitch.      Anyway, I have a USB cable to finally hook my printer up to my computer and dinner to cook. (I'm making  tinolang manok  [chicken with chayote and spinach] and rice.  Yum.)  Hope you all have great weekends.  Mel's speaking at a NAAAP conference tomorrow and I'm tagging along, then Sunday I'm having Stef (and Paul), Adrienne (and Jon), Hatty and Yvette over for dinner.  I haven't cooked for anyone since May.
Audrey In Animation   urlLink     Sorry. Lolo/Grandpa Monchichi was just a test. Blogger's all confusing with how you put up pics and whatnot--you have to download this messaging-like publisher called Hello to do it for you (which I think sort of sucks).  Anyhow.  Remember that site I mentioned that lets you make a Buddy Icon of yourself? (Go here: illustmaker.abi-station.com/index_en.shtml)   All Hyphen staff made icons of themselves and you can see them on the masthead of issue 4 (but mine's not there--I was in Bakersfield at the time).  But I wanted to try one out anyhow; we're suposed to have our icons replace our staff pics on the Hyphen bio page online.  I didn't think my original .gif looked like me (the hair was parted to the wrong side and too short), so I tried again. Now I'm more satisfied. It's Audrey in animation! Cute, huh?  Now go make  Buddy Icons of yourselves!    urlLink

An Elephant Never Forgets  Listening to:  Midnight Marauders  - A Tribe Called Quest  I finally washed FIVE freaking loads of laundry yesterday afternoon.       I was at the laundromat reading my trashy magazine (Allure) with Natalie Portman on the cover and turned around to look at the clock on the wall. I glimpsed a familiar face--I thought it was this girl I was really good friends with in high school, Michelle. I couldn't forget her--she was a tiny Korean girl who was an inch or two shorter than me, had a cute round face and brown hair, and the sweetest little voice. I dunno, I figured I was imagining things and I went back to my magazine. But then I had to walk out to my car to get bleach and fabric softener and I noticed the car parked next to mine was the same exact Toyota Corolla that Michelle and her sister used to drive in high school. The license plate frame said 'Bill Wright Toyota' and 'Bakersfield.' I knew it was her.  So what did I do?  Shit.  I fought the urge to go up to her and awkwardly ask her if she might recognize me, then tell her who I am, and ask her how she's doing, etc. Realizing that I was too lame to do that, made me hide behind my trashy magazine even more. What's really funny is that the last time I was living in Oakland I thought I walked past her on Grand Avenue, but it happened so fast, I wouldn't have been able to run after her and have that awkward moment, even if I'd wanted to. Now I realize that probably  was  her who walked past me.  Now you may ask why I didn't do anything at the laundromat... Well, I've had the experience once before that I ran into someone I went to high school with, someone who hung out in my circle of friends but I just lost touch with. Well, I re-introduced myself to that person and they totally blanked on me. It's not that I looked different, but they didn't even remember my name. Like I disappeared from all the past experiences we had together--erased. And suffice it to say that my ego was actually crushed--I actually thought, 'How can you not remember  ME ?  I'm AUDREY, DAMMIT! ' (For real, though. I know there are a ton of Filipino Audreys out there, but there are only a handful of Ednalinos in this world. And there's only one  ME .)  But yeah, back to my story. I didn't want to have to be disappointed that someone I was as close to as a sister when I was a junior and senior in high school might not remember me.  Sigh .  It only makes me wonder...those of you reading this, those of you who know me... Will I always be remembered? Is it any consolation knowing that  I  won't forget even if  you  do?  On a totally different note...  I am still getting those annoying before 8 AM calls from that 'unavailable' number. In fact, that shit woke me up yesterday morning.  Blah.
Love Those Hons!      I feel bad. One of my friends who I work on Hyphen with was talking to me on AIM, wanting to discuss Hyphen internal biz stuff and I wasn't in the mood to chat about it. I freaking live in the Hyphen Apartment with Melissa--the issue 1 cover is up as artwork on our living room wall, we have a huge hall closet dedicated to housing Hyphen shit... The two of us try not to talk about it casually, so we don't burn ourselves out.      I just walked back and forth between the kitchen and my room/desk so I wouldn't get caught up. I also didn't want to be rude and be all, 'You know what? Can we not talk about Hyphen right now?'    Anyhow.      I wish I'd taken a 'before' picture of my room to show you how fucking chaotic it looked with random shit strewn all over the floor, boxes, styrofoam and bags of clothes. Today my room pretty much looks like I envisioned it to look. I'm not done, but no more piles of junk on the floor. Everything's put away except for the last of my clothes and papers that need filing.      It was sort of hard sifting through certain boxes. I got caught up looking through old photo albums that I took from Bakersfield, with the intention of buying new albums and re-arranging the photos. Lots of photos of Mama and it made me a little sad to look at them and miss her. I also found a few articles of clothing I 'stole' from her closet before Daddy and I donated all her belongings to Good Will. I picked out some photos to put on my nifty magnetic bulletin board strip--most of them pics of my parents.   Some days I'm fine, and some days I feel really empty and heartbroken, missing my mom.     Trevor called me the other day and he was like, 'I know how it is. It comes and goes, but it's always there.' His father died when he was still a teenager (I think). Trevor met Mama last summer, too.     Sigh.      Last night I took a break from the process of unpacking and went to Berkeley to hang out with three of the Hon siblings (my friends Tim, Rachel and Phil) and Nam. We watched  Starsky & Hutch  at Tim's grandmother's apartment. She wanted to watch the movie with us and Tim and all them were trying to coax her into going to bed. They were like, 'It's a bad movie. It'll give you nightmares. Go to sleep--you want me to tuck you in?' They're grandmother's so cute--they imitate her accent the way I like to imitate my parents' and aunties'/uncles' accents. It was good to see Tim and all them--it was the first time for me to see Tim in over a year; the first time to see Rach in almost two years. I was surprised to see Phil all grown--I first met him when he was like 13/14, running around barefoot, and now he's probably 18 or 19 and taller than Tim!       I love the Hon Family--their house was like my Angel Island when I first moved up to the Bay Area from LA. Ah, memories.
Hello from my beautiful new Oakland home! :-)      You probably guessed that I finally set my new desk up and hooked up my computer. (Don't tell the guys who live upstairs, but Mel and I are piggybacking [stealing] their wireless Internet. Shhh! [That just means money I would've spent on Internet will now go to digital cable, ha!]) All I did was plug in my wireless USB adapter and  VOILA! , I'm online. WAH!       So here's an update to tide you over til I finish unpacking, etc...      Mel told me before I moved in that there's a youngster (undergrad at Berkeley) who lives above us (his room is above mine) who used to give her and her old roommate problems. He'd play bass and drums loud, play his music loud, have loud sex... He hasn't been a problem for a while, because Mel and Barbara (her old roomie) would go upstairs and knock on the door and complain. But Mel and I ran into him the other day on our way out (to Target for some shopping) and she was like, 'Oh, Brian, I want you to meet Audrey. She just moved in with me.' She said how she thinks we should all sit down and come up with some common courtesy rules about noise control. I agree. I'm going back to school (I have two weeks of freedom left!) and I'm not trying to be all gangster and walking my ass upstairs to curse that fucker out because I can't study.       But the loud sex thing? I'm not tripping off that. I've had roommates with skanky One Minute Man boyfriends--I've heard rhythm-less bed-banging. (Don't know what's worse, no rhythm or no stamina/endurance?) I think Brian-Who-Lives-Upstairs is a Ten Second Brother (but he sounds like he's got a little rhythm). I heard some bad-banging at like 2 AM this morning--I mentally timed it and it seriously didn't go on for too long. In my head I was like, 'BOO! I feel sorry for whoever's lying underneath you all unsatisfied right now! BOO SOME MORE! BOOOOOO!' The least he could've done was go for a second ten-second round, but he didn't.        Look at me, talking shit already about the neighbors.  But it's okay. The really good loud-sex noises will be coming from my room soon (haha).      Anyhow!      I moved in the first wave of my things on Friday afternoon/evening. Then Mel and I headed to Ikea to do some shopping for a TV/media stand. I actually wanted to furnish my room Crate & Barrel or Pottery Barn style, just because I didn't want to get callouses from building my furniture (I really moved in with little in terms of furniture [just a desk chair, bookcase and a mattress]), but I shall have an Ikea room, too. My new furniture (dresser, bedframe, desk, chair) has cost me a little over $400. It's not so bad--I'm just not down with the raw wood look, so I need to stain/varnish my shit so it doesn't look so cheap (haha!).      Saturday I rented this crazy 'luxury' minivan (is there such a thing?) and drove solo to Bakersfield to fetch boxes out of my storage space. (It was a daylong mission. I drove down, got my shit, then drove back up. I left the Bay Area around noon and returned about 9 PM.) When Daddy and I packed up our house so Junior (my brother) could move in, I marked about 4 boxes with the letters 'SF' on them, so I could easily spot them when I went to retrieve them. Unfortunately Daddy and my uncles put some of those boxes in the far back of the storage space, behind big furniture that I'm too weak to move, so I only came back with 2 boxes (none of which had any kitchen stuff that I wanted/needed).  The trip wasn't bad at all. I rocked out to Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Justin Timberlake the whole way down (I made sure to bring CDs that made me want to either dance or sing along so I wouldn't fall asleep.) I ate In-N-Out at my half-way pit stop.  And I visited Mama's grave. Instead of flowers, this time I brought her a turtle. I was annoyed that I had to cut my visit/talk short, though. The sprinklers were on at the cemetery, so I got caught a couple times as it went around and around. I think my mom understands why I had to cut my visit short. Before I left, I told Mama about my move and how she would like both Mel and my new home.     Sunday afternoon Hatty, Mel, Adrienne and her friend (visiting from Australia) John, helped me move the very last wave of things from Pacifica to Oakland. The biggest pain in the ass was my mattress. I had no problem transporting that shit from SF to Pacifica (shorter distance, and I had more rope to work with), but this time around it was a nightmare. We dropped Hatty off at BART in Colma, retied my mattress, stopped off at In-N-Out in Daly City, stopped at Serramonte Mall and instead reshifted boxes to squeeze my mattress into Ade's minivan, then we were on our way.      Anyhow, let me go. I need to run errands. I need to mail Jeremy his present so maybe it will arrive in Philly in time for his bday, and (EEK!) rush Hatty on a flyer design so I can get Hyphen flyers made for the AAJA Unity Conference for Todd and Ursula in DC this whole week/end.      I need to get my shit in order for the Hyphen meeting Thursday. Ugh!
I was checking up on my cousin Dylan and Fannie's wedding site (they just got married on July 31st!) and I found some of their photos already up, so I thought I'd borrow a few and post them for your viewing pleasure (hopefully that's alright).  That wedding was one of the most beautiful ceremonies I have ever seen.  It was elegant, simple, thoughtful, and gorgeous!  (and heck of a lot of work!)  Enjoy!
urlLink    It was great to watch this photo being taken, I'm really glad it turned out so well.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Mother of the groom (auntie Deborah), looking stunning, along with a tearful uncle Perry.  It was a beautiful ceremony.&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    This photographer did a great job!  These photos are magazine worthy.  I mean, can you say Hallmark?  (in a good way of course)&nbsp; urlLink
urlLink    Aw, what a loverly couple.  They really are two of the nicest people.  &nbsp; urlLink
urlLink     Dylan and Fannie's wedding cake - it doesn't get much nicer than that.  I swear it looks exactly like it did in the magazine!  Way to go Dad!  &nbsp; urlLink
What goes bzzzzz bzzzzz silence ouch!  me being stung by a wasp.  Yes an angry brute declared me lunch today at work, and now I've got a hand the size of a baseball glove.  (okay, it's not that bad or I wouldn't be able to type, but there is a pretty nice swollen lump on the back of my right hand that doesn't want to go away despite repeated icings).  I had to call first aid so some one could bring me up some 'sting stop', which didn't really help that much anyway, and the guy had to fill out all this paper work, just for one little sting.  But I guess for insurence purposes...  I kept working anyway, although it was hard to serve ice creams because I was trying not to bend my hand.  I guess the sting was payback for the many wasps I've sacrificed to hot water for the common good (and our sanity up at the Soda Fountain!) but I think I would have rather slammed my finger in the door - oh wait, I did that too!  Not having much luck with my hands today...  at least I'm about to sleep so I can endanger them with knives and other potentially hazardous items.  Words of Wisdom:  stay away from wasps drunk on sugar, and angry because you've just tried to drown them in really hot water, and when shutting doors behind you, hold firmly to the handle.  That's all for now. :)   p.s. I'm really not a bad person, I only killed those wasps because they were a danger to us and the visitors, and our (by us and ours I mean me and my coworkers) mental health - have you tried to pour a pop with five angry wasps buzzing around your head and hands?  not a fun activity!)
Whew!  While moving upstairs has been great because we don't have to repack and then unpack everything, it's a little like a bloody 5-day marathon! Okay, we've only been moving stuff up since monday, and it's been up and down those freaking stairs I don't know how many times with books shelves and beds and laundry baskets full of plates and food and blenders and more!  Not to mention that my previous bedroom now looks like a closet threw up on it - clothes everywhere.  I am definately going to have to do some weeding in that department because I don't think i can fit them all in my 'quaint' new closetless bedroom.   And I still can't decide which door to leave and which one to put my bookshelf in front - the door leading to the kitchen (closer to the food and the bathroom), or the one leading to the living room (potentially a quieter way, closer to the front door) ...  any suggestions?  I am still enjoying my colour choice, and the few pictures I have put up go very well with it. (yay)  But it's late and I have to work, again, early...  so goodnight
Yay!!! Who gets to move upstairs today??? We do! Yep, we just did the 'walk around' with our landlady and now the floor is ours (and by floor i mean the main suite of the house). We're pretty excited, and danced down the stairs. It's time to start packing and hauling stuff up to our new abode. Wahoo!
Horray for having the same days off as my roomates, finally! today was splendid - we started our morning with blackberry infused pancakes (need i say yum?) and then headed out to the Sooke Potholes, a 45min drive and 20 min hike away. It was glorious - the water was cool, but oh so refreshing, and when we came upon Crystal's favourite swimming spot, there was not a soul in sight... soooo nice, just us, the sunshine, and the water. But then, 2 minutes later a rather large group of people ambled down the path... sigh, so much for solitude - but what can you expect from such a divine swimming place? After swimming up the river aways and watching some boys jump off cliffs into the water (yikes - i just keep picturing my cousin with his lacerated spleen from landing badly off a 30 foot cliff a couple weeks ago), we swam back an prepared ourselves for some much needed sunbathing. (well that only lasted for a little while until we had to break open the food bag and munch for a while - mmmm more good food like samosas and veggies and trail mix, and crystal's homemade candied ginger, oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies!) It was a wicked way to spend the day. When we arrived home, it was time to check out some of the summer olympics - rowing and gymnastics to be specific (those gymnists can do some crazy shit i tell you). Then my good friend Oona came over and we got ready to go dancing at Steamers Pub where Velvet plays dance music with some funk every sunday night. Good times were had. All in all I'd have to say it was a pretty stellar day, obviously (sorry, but that's been the word of the day). :) But sweet dreams are awaiting me, and my eyelids are going on strike.... p.s. Happy Birthday Grandma!
early morning delights: Arriving at work for 7:30 or 8:00 am rarely has any perks (besides that of getting off by 4 or 4:30), except on those glorious days where I get to ice the cinnamon buns.  Yes, spreading soft cream cheese icing on still warm, gooey, sweet buns, and then swirling it with my fingers (gloved of course) to make it look simply irrisistable, is one of my favourite jobs.  The funny part is that I don't even like cream cheese icing, and our cinnmon buns are made with corn syrup, not honey, so they're way to sweet.  But making food look asthetically pleasing is something I love to do...  perhaps I should go into the culinary arts?  I think I'd probably have to expand my tastebud tolerance if i were to do that because I could make everything, but then I wouldn't be able to tell if it was good because I would probably dislike most of the ingredients I put in it...   sigh...  I'm working on it.  My roomate Crystal provides tough love when it comes to trying new things so I've now aquired a taste for previously untouchable items (according to me) like peppers (although I mostly like the orange and yellow ones), lentils, zucchini, spanikopita, and soy milk.  I'm sure most of you are shaking your head at me right now, but at least I'm trying right? :)  However, I think that tomatoes are always going to be on my ewww list - I've tried to eat them, but there's just something about the combination of juicyness/watery flavour/peel texture that I can't deal with.  But I was supposed to be giving an ode to cinnamon buns.  Now, if you want to treat yourself to a truly divine example of what a cinnamon bun can be, you should take yourself over to the Kooteney Bakery Cafe in Nelson, BC (a long treck for some of you I realize, but I'll put it out there anyway) where my dad makes a delectable pecan cinnamon bun with a buttercream icing.  And so I shall leave you with that scrumptous vision.  I think I'm drooling a little... ;)
urlLink    victory! a concert to remember.  urlLink
urlLink    hot hot hot (no really, it was swealtering in there!)  urlLink
Thanks to Tara's friend Jordon for the photos (hope it's okay I posted them) :)
People who can hack being in the front row of a concert shouldn't be there in the first place! Ah Matthew Good, a great show, a great band, a great location, and a stupid audience - what else is new. This is not to say that I didn't throughly enjoy both the opening act, Wil, and Matt Good, they were amazing - especially from our hard won front row spots, but why do people think that shoving as hard as they can the people in front and to the side of them is going to make anyone's experience any better? I seriously had to elbow this guy a few times because he kept pushing up against me, and believe me, I wasn't planning on moving anywhere - we were about as close as you could get without being on stage. I understand that with a rock crowd in a bar, there's expected to be a little pushing and such, but three people body surfing in a not so large venue, come on now that's just a little ridiculous. I think that the aggressive side of me comes out when placed in those sorts of situations, I was just as ready to shove back, and I don't think that me and Tara moved more than a couple of inches the whole night. I certaintly wouldn't want to be a security person at one of those things! When it started getting rowdy, the girl next to me started freaking out a little, and I thought she was going to throw up, so we had to let her out - the security guys were pretty good at making sure the smaller people were doing okay (not that they asked us - we must have looked pretty determined). But I'm ranting. The music was great, he played mostly from his new album and a couple well chosen older songs like 'Picture Yourself' (forgive me if I have the title wrong...). And at the end me and Tara managed to pick up one of the set lists and a drumstick (yes, it's a little obsessive, but fun nonetheless) which we got signed by the man himself! Tara was tempted to stalk him back to his hotel, but we decided that would be way too creepy as the streets were fairly deserted and he was walking with two body/security guards... I swear that we're not that obsessed (disclaimer - I was mostly following Tara... really...). One girl asked to have Matt's half finished glass of beer and she got it! ewww, what would you do with that? What ever tickles your fancy I guess (well, not like I can do much with a drumstick, but at least it's keepable). Anyway, if you're a Matthew Good fan, I highly recommend you see him live, but just be prepared to stand your ground if your in the throng.
Well, upon contemplation, neither previously mentioned colours fit, and so I ended up with a light green titled 'spring fest'. Me and my roomate then proceeded to apply said paint to the wall at 9:30pm - not bothering with a coat of primer to help cover the dark purple currently covering the walls of my soon to be bedroom. Needless to say, we were tired, the purple showed through, and I realized how small this room really is. It shall be me, and my bed, and then the walls. Okay, it's not that bad, but it's definately the smallest room I've ever inhabited before! (It does, however, have nice big windows, a cool built in cupboard, and a funky old light fixture - having been designed as the dinning room). The colour is bright, but I think once I get everything in place it will be a happy medium.  I think that the idea of painting and choosing colours and decorating etc is always more exciting than the actual hard labour (big surprise there), and I am happy it's finished.  one more week and then we can be moving upstairs!  Yay for hardwood floors, a plethora of cupboards and shelves, a fireplace, and our own mailbox!  I'm planning on having a 'moving up' party around then, so anyone living nearby who wants a nice dinner for the price of carrying a few items up the stairs, please give me a call. ;)  Well, it's time to remove the tape from the walls of my affectionately dubbed 'medicine cabinet' room, here's hopeing no paint bled through!
i've discovered the joy of blogs.  blog blog blog. If only I could remember all the great things I wanted to write about...  Today my biggest problem was choosing a colour to paint my room, I'm waffling between 'windy hill' and 'tropical mango'  any suggestions?  (windy hill is a lighte bluey colour).
i will start to go away     i want to say i am a free man now. i don't want to hurt anyone. specially not her coz i have hurt her a million times. as it is, i don't know if i am, i guess i am. but she's getting by. her pride and probably her resolve to make things work for her is getting her by. though i know deep inside she's hurting. because of me.  i know how i can make her really happy. but i just cannot do it now. most especially now that i have to clear out certain issues about myself.  i am contented to see her happy, no matter how contrived it is. i know she's not, deep inside she's not. but something tells me she's on her way there. she can make things work for herself. so i believe i am ready to leave her now for good. maybe slowly, i will drift away. and never bother her.  we'll finally have our separate lives. maybe once in a while i will check on her. i hope i can let her be. let her find her own peace. i will leave her for good.
august  3  my thoughts are filled with just getting out, leaving everything behind. maybe i am a walking contradiction. there is no other way for me but to lead. here i am now. leading. the pressure is getting too much. sometimes i feel like this is not me anymore. i hate some stuff i am obliged to do. smile here, smile there. give commendations. be a people person. i fucking hate all these crap.  there are times i want to be left alone. i want to have some quiet time. i want to do my thing. in spite of myself, i realized all i want to have is a low profile life. a quiet life. maybe that's why i wasn't too keen on modelling. people are so nosy. and i couldn't just smile when asked to. i just want to do my thing. i want to sleep when i want to, i want to wake up no matter how late. i want to dress up the way i want to, i hate ties, i hate looking so yuppy. i want to curse whenever i feel like it. i will be friendly when i want to, i will be nice when i feel like being nice.  show me the light please as i am about to go nuts where i am now.
Well, I've finally taken to reading other people's blogs and I've found that diving into the minds and lives of others can be quite refreshing.  I have also recently reviewed one of those internet profiles of a friend I thought I knew.  Apparently, I never even knew his real name and have been calling him by an alias all these years (yeah right).  His profile describes someone only vaguely like the man I thought I knew.  It's like finding out your husband is a secret agent for the CIA after 15 years of marriage - you saw the movie.    Anyway, as I am terminally honest in all aspects - even internet life (perish the thought) I find it extremely funny that we feel that we need to embellish online.  The internet has provided us with endless opportunities to communicate with our friends & loved ones, to express our ideas and beliefs, and to meet that hottie we've always dreamed of.  Trouble is, once you meet face to face you discover that you prefer the online fantasy to reality.  Oh, and I immediately deleted all quotes and quibbles from MY profile - no one would ever believe anyone is that perfect... they'd just assume embellishment. ;)
More Ying & Yang  Reviewing my last entry, I realize that I only gave one ying & yang example.  I could give more, like how great it is that my youngest daughter is home after living with her grandmother for the past three months.  It's great having her back where she belongs, but it's not great waking up three times in the night - bottle break, potty break and day break.  She was up at 6:45 am saying 'Mommy, its a little bit morning, time to wake up!'    Gotta take the good with the bad, right?    And have another cup of coffee to get me through the day.
As I burned my tongue on my oatmeal this morning, I started thinking about how my life has lately been a pure example of ying & yang; a complete balance of good & bad.  Examples being first of all, I had to cancel a very chi-chi dinner I had planned to include a 5 course meal under a full miami moon, oceanside with 4 french wines to accompany the meal.  Masquerade, gourmet cuisine, great people - to say the least I was extremely dissapointed in what, to me, represented complete and utter failure on my part.  But then, on the day of the cancelled dinner, someone handed me an article extolling another, past event that I put together.  The writer, bless him, described the event as cozy and refreshing with the company of 'gentle folk'.  As, he described it exactly as I remember it - and I felt really good to know that someone else besides myself really enjoyed the fruits of my labor.  So I am once again reminded that you take the good with the bad.  Even when I am at my lowest point, it takes so little to bring me back to the sunny side of life.  Thanks, Mr. Dolen.
Day 2.  It's so exciting!  I realized last night, while pondering today's entry, that I have actually misnamed my blog.  What I meant to call it was 'Diva-lish Drivel'.  However, after looking up dribble in my webster's, I realize that Dribble is exactly what I meant to say.    After all, this will be a slow and steady flow of my thoughts and afterthoughts.  So, while it won't include anything about basketball (except maybe a word or two about the WNBA Miami Sol) it really will be dribble.  Besides, drivel is such an ugly word.
Hmm... a captive audience.  Where do I begin?  Welcome friends to my blog.  I'm very excited to have you here and hope I don't bore you to tears with my diva dribble.  Through this blog, you too can learn to be a diva ;)  So, day 1, page 1, paragraph 3.  Life on the internet begins and life as we know it is forever changed... or not.
Raise a glass  Last night I hosted my Wine Club.  Well, its not really MY Wine Club, I just come up with the theme then plan the event, write up the invites, mail the invites, coordinate with the wine suppliers, and manage the RSVP list.  Oh, and then I host the event.  I am the 'hostess with the mostess'!    Any way, last night I had high hopes of attracting over 75 people.  I was lead to believe that the suppliers had at least 60 confirmed reservations.  Suffice it to say that out of the 15 or so people there, none of them came from those 60 confirmed reservations.    Nonetheless, the wines were good - notice I used plural wines, as I did partake of more than one.  The event was a success in so much as those who attended were sophisticated and social.  Several groups of conversation developed and everyone mingled throughout the evening.   Did I mention that I did partake of plural wines? *grin*  I still have to say it... I love my  urlLink job!   And the other thing I've been waiting to say all week long -- Happy Friday!   *horns and whistles blowing in the background as I beat my drum!*   Diva out.
Rock the Universe!  Well, its hard to come up with titles all the time, so today is 'Rock the' Day.  (see post below if you're confused).   Check your 'scope at  urlLink Astrology - Horoscopes - Jonathan Cainer's Zodiac Forecasts , 'cause Jonathon is always right.  He must have a direct line to the planets or something - he never ceases to amaze -- uh, that is, rock -- me. *grin*  And in honor of our new official 'Rock the' Day, go out today and rock something.  Rock the vote, rock your chair, rock somebody's world!    Rock ya' later! (Diva out.)
Rock the Vote!  I received a very powerful e-mail this morning from a dear friend who has served in the Navy.  I'm sure he speaks for many of the men & women serving our country's military.  I'm not exactly pro-military but I certainly do value and appreciate the rights and freedom we enjoy because of their service.  So, without further ado...  Subject: right to vote!   Hey folks this is Jason. I am just sending out this little reminder that election time is almost upon us. This is a very important issue for me because i know a lot of people take our right to vote for granted. right now there are American troops fighting to protect what we have and many more (including yours truly) that have served in the military. please take the 15 minutes out of your day to register and another hour out of your day to actually vote. i would be very disappointed to find out some of you just didn't feel like it or were too busy. Imagine how bad you would feel if we didn't have that right at all.  Thanks,  Jason

Thank you, your honor!  I have finally had my 'day in court'; I think everyone should have one of these.  It's like Andy Warhol's 15 minutes of fame, except mine took about a half hour.  Without going into all the sordid details, let me just say that the judge and state attorney were not impressed with my dead-beat-dad ex-husband (my, he's earned quite a title!) and they were NOT having any of his excuses.  Lesson to any dads out there considering not paying child support: no matter how hard you try to justify not giving the mom child support money - your ass is going to jail.  That wonderful humanitarian of a judge told him to show up next week 'with money or a toothbrush.'  She's giving him a chance to keep his sorry ass out of jail, while at the same time getting me a little of what I'm due...that's fair.  She's my hero!
More blogster diving goodness  While I am actually managing to get work done this Mundane, uh, Monday morning, I did click that fabulous little NextBlog button.  Its an addiction I have, I need caffeine and NextBlog every morning to get me going.  I don't know how that button works, or how it selects which blog to go to next, but today there was a sort of theme woven into the melange of goodies.  I found one blog totally devoted to the daily doses of medication and inevitable deterioration of one woman's 14 year old cat, as it dies from some form or another of cancer.    Then there was  urlLink Not my dog , which didn't mention anything about a dog.  She has a cat though, that kept her up all night recently.  Anyone who's ever hated their cat due to an all night howling session can relate.  And finally,  urlLink Jason's Blog , which didn't mention any animals at all, but has a picture of a dog's tongue hanging out of a huge gaping dog mouth.  All made for some good reading today.  This blog is turning into a blog journal of my blog travels.  Geez, have I no life of my own to blog?  Oh, wait - I went to a wine tasting on Saturday night.  There, I do have a life.  Of course, it was free, at a liquor store.  Not much more than a poorly disguised marketing ploy to sell liquor.  At least my events are social and entertaining - and you get more than a thimbleful of the stuff.  My event is next Thursday, can't wait to see how that goes.  Oh, crap its this Thursday... with only 5 RSVPs. *gasp*  Undaunted, I'm going to have a good time no matter how many people show!

Instant Gratification   That little counter thing in the corner made my whole day.  Its up to a whopping 10! Hey, it may not seem like much to you, but I'm easy to please.  I'm a girl of very simple needs.  Plus, Leann left me a message on my tag board.  This is a gold star day! :)  Well, technically she left a message for that little slut in the mini skirt.  *sigh*   But hey, sex sells, right?
Prouder than a...  Ok, so I can't think of a saying that would complete that.  All I can think of is 'happier than a pig in --' but this is a clean blog so I can't complete that one.  Anyway, I am so proud of myself.  I have managed to dress up my page quite nicely today.  As we tour the page, you will notice in the upper left hand corner my new counter.  My pathetic hunger for recognition requires that I know exactly how many people have visited my page.  The down side to this is that this could end up like the little red 0 on my answering machine.  Screaming at me the blatant fact that NO ONE has called. *sigh*  Also, you will see the sexy little weather pixie, announcing the perfect tropical weather here in sunny South Florida.  From what I've seen, the tramp changes her outfits according to time of day, temperature and weather patterns.  Pretty clever.  And did I mention that she's looks just like me!  Then, just below the tramp -- I mean the weather pixie -- I've placed a Tag Board.  Here you can give me your thoughts, comments and other worthless... uh, that is...worthwhile input.  Just more blogging fun than any one person should have in just one day!  On that note, I'm going home.  Blogging on hold till Monday.

While we're on the subject...   Boy, talk about timing.  After extolling the pleasure of a drag queen show, I get this fun little quiz in my e-mail today.   You may want to take this test before heading out to your local show ;)    urlLink Female or Shemale? Take the test!
Tired, but smiling   Perched on a bar stool in a Moulin Rouge-like bar/restaurant, with drag queens and old queens milling and spilling all around me.  That is how I spent last night.  If you've never been to a drag show, let me assure you that you have not yet fully lived.    Went to a new place called Madame's last night and saw some of the most entertaining performers wearing more makeup than Tammy Faye - and looking good.  I especially liked the Bette Miller impersonator and the very large black, um, person - s/he really enjoyed singing and dancing on that little stage with the hot blinding stage lights and lively crowd pouring down on her.  My goddess friend Gloria left the bar moaning, 'I can't believe I sucked face with a gay man!'  And, according to her, he was 'very competent'.  He admitted that, while he prefers men, the last woman he slept with glued her phone number to his coffee table.  Competent indeed.  And all this on a school night, when I knew i had to get up in the morning but didn't really care.
One Last Post for the day...   Finally getting the chance to go out with a co-worker/friend/fellow goddess tonight.  And what could be more appropriate for us than to go to a dinner and cabaret show - drag queen style.  This should be a blast - I need a good laugh.  You know, the kind of laugh that shakes your whole body; the kind where the next day your stomach reprimands you for doing all those damned sit-ups but you were only laughing.  Laughing till your face hurts.  Then there's the meal that comes with the dinner, the great conversation and company of Gloria and the piece de resistance  *typed with a french accent*  -- this is a free meal.  There's no better dinner than a free dinner.  I'll have to put it all in my blog tomorrow.  BTW, if Andre Gide were around today, do you think he would he have written his 'Journal' via blog?

More Blogging Fun...   3 postings in one day - a new high.  That's because its August, and things move pretty slow in Miami in August.  As a result, I am able to do a little more surfing than usual, and once again my new best friend NextBlog has provided me with great amusement.  Two great blogs to check:  urlLink  Big Pink Cookie, 'Taking the blah out of blog'  and  urlLink  Ginger Girl 'Welcome to the Venting Zone'   where I found this quaint little mental excercise, which actually came from another site.  click  urlLink  HERE   to stretch your mental muscle.  This link actually takes you to yet another site that I rambled through on my afternoon of goofing off. *wink*  I guess I'll go look for something else to do, and get another coke - the more caffeine the better, I always say.   Oh, and another thing.  My extremely weird friend Fred Gerbilman - he's not rich enough to called eccentric - says I'm weird, which is why he loves me.  This is like the pot calling the kettle black.  He sends me some of the most bizarre links to sites ranging from mundane to profane.  But I'm the weird one.    I may have to start sharing some of the more bizarre sights/sites he sends me just to prove my point... And just to prove my point, *raising my hand with finger pointing triumphanly toward the sky* you can visit his Rant blog at  urlLink Gerbilman Rant  .    The fact that I've figured out how to add links to my page could really piss him off - this could have lots of entertainment value.

Here's a nice thought...  It is vital that people 'count their blessings' to appreciate what they possess without having to undergo its actual loss. --Abraham Maslow  Deserves a little reflection, don't ya' think?
I wonder, does it make me a bad person because I'm enjoying putting the squeeze on my dead-beat-dad ex-husband?  After 10 months of no payments in child support, we're finally going to court at the end of this month.  He now has less than 2 weeks to come up with the dough he owes me or he'll sit in jail until he pays me.  I've had 2 years of struggle - of wondering how I'll pay the rent and the day care and still manage to buy food for my two children.  In the meantime, he's living in his girlfriend's house, driving her car, sleeping in her bed and eating her food.  OK, so maybe I'm a little bitter about the whole thing.  Maybe after he married me he finally realized that SHE is his one true love and he couldn't bear to live a lie by being married to me.  Or maybe he just got in too deep and needed her to bail him out.  Well, now she may have to do just that - literally.  (Although I really hope it doesn't come to that - I would prefer getting paid.)  Does it make me a bad person?  I just want to get paid.  And see him squirm just a little.   As for my two wonderful little girls - I must say that I got the better end of this whole divorce deal.  I have the pleasure of the company of two of the most beautiful and charming little girls I've ever known.  Never mind they're my children, they are two exceptional human beings.  Every day I get more and more joy from knowing them and seeing them grow.  There is nothing more valuable to me than one of their hugs, or seeing their faces light up when I pick them up from school or grandma's house.  I know that, in spite of all the struggle and hassle and frustration that comes from being a single mom with less than adequate support from an absentee father, having them in my life makes my life worthwhile and fulfilled.
Waxing Philosophical   Seems like I'm coming to an end of another chapter in my neverending novel of a life.  Well, actually it will end eventually - only I won't be around to comment on the final chapter.  It just feels like I've had a very rough two years, much of the drama created by my own actions of course.  And now, I'm reaching a very anti-climatic point in the story.  I can't say 'ending' because that's not what it is.  Any ending is really just another beginning.  And that's where I'm at - another beginning.  Opportunity disguised as loss - I take every loss as an opportunity for something else. I've had plenty of loss these past years and I just know that its time to forge ahead into some new beginning... but what?
Next Blog bringing the world closer together  Found another interesting blog today.  I love that Next Blog link; when I get bored at work I follow that link where ever it wants me to go.  Today, along with a really boring blog on handhelds and another one in portuguese, it took me to  urlLink  Mercury Frog   .  He's getting married in a few days, and apparently pondering the realities of grown up life.  Can't wait to hear about the big day.    Oh, and as for my cake-eating friend... apparently the bakery is closing down.
This will be the second time I'm trying to get this blog entry in.  Yesterday I discovered, much to my dismay, that there is another blog under the same name as mine.  Can you believe it?! Only, I've spelled it differently - her version is Diva - liscious.  You can check it out if you like - she's got an interesting life and pictures to prove it.  Go to  urlLink  Diva - liscious    And, now for a little self indulgence and pity.  I've decided that life isn't finished with me yet, and I apparently have more growing to do if I'm ever to be ready for real, soul-shaking soul-mate kind of love.  And if I hear one more time that I'm a nice girl, or a good girl I'm going to scream.  All that goodness and niceness is getting me nowhere in the romance department.  I mean, really - even the most horrid, ugly troll bitches get to have boyfriends and/or husbands.  Yes, I've had a husband but that one, apparently, didn't really count.    One of my friends has reminded me that anything worth having is worth waiting for.  Easy for him to say, now that he can have his cake and eat it too.   But enough of that.  Onward and upward - and hope springs eternal.  My horoscope insists that things are looking very good for August and I'm betting the bank on it!
Not going to dwell on what i've done... just forging ahead blindly into the possibilities. But there is hope, as he is thinking about me still.  I wanted to comment on a funny coincidence that has given me a strange perspective into a stranger's life.  a neighbor's life actually.  5 or 6 years ago, a guy tried to pick me up in a club.  He gave me his number but i left it at the bar and never called him.    I actually saw him at a few other places around town, always with a group of friends - apparently we liked the same places.  He didn't seem to remember or recognize me, and I never tried to say hello.  Now, it turns out that when I moved into my new apartment in January, I moved into HIS building.  We really do like the same places.  But being his neighbor has afforded me a greater insight into this man's life - and on a greater scale, I think into the lives of many people just like him. Young, professional, sufficiently successful, and single.  I know what car he drives - by seeing him parking in the garage one day.  I know he lives on the 23rd floor of my building, since we ride in the elevator together frequently.  He leaves for work at 8:30 and gets home around 7pm.  I've even seen him walking out of the 'gentleman's club' around the corner from our building.    And finally, I've seen him with maybe 2 different women - so i've seen his taste in women too.   It's strange and deep in my heart it makes me a little sad, because I see this man's solitary life and some of its private details.  I sometimes wonder how it feels to be him - solitary -- no children, no wife.  I wonder if he's happy living alone.  Maybe he has a pet, but I've never seen him walking a dog... a cat maybe?    So many of us walk together, live together and are so alone.  We think that no one knows our sorrow or cares; we are all looking for something more.    I've still never really said hello to him.  I have no interest in really getting to know him, although he may be a very nice person.  It may be cowardice, but I'm just happy knowing his secrets.  And in some small way this makes me feel more connected to the world as a whole - it reminds me that we are all the same, we come from the same source and we are all one.
Well, I've done the unthinkable.  I've opened up to contact with the one person who is both heaven & hell, wrapped up in one neat package.  Love and hate, together in a fiery passion... god I've missed him!  Still not sure what I was thinking when I ruined it all, or why I think I could ever fix what I f*cked up. But, onwards and upwards.  Maybe I'm just craving another escape to NY? Or maybe there really is a reason why I can't get him out of my head.  Let the ride begin...
And another thing... how is that there are 87 million singles over the age of 18 in the US and I can't get even one of them to take me out to dinner?
And I just thought of a better name for my blog... Diva-licious.  works for now, anyway.
Universal Wonders  How is it that everytime I finally give up on ever hearing from someone ever again, they call?  I can't help but believe that I really do make things happen.  Just by thinking about him (and refusing to ever contact him again) the most divine man I've ever met (as close to a god as I am a goddess) dissappeared - as was his own divine right.  You know how mercurial we gods can be ;)  I gave up, and he called. My divine Diva-ness proved irresistible.
Back in order...?   Well, I think I've got my page back in order.  If not, this may be as good as it gets for a while.   Just wanted to give thanks to my friends.  I was having one of those 'poor me' moments over the weekend.  Single mom, all alone with no one to talk to, yadda yadda yadda.  I am ashamed to admit that I was feeling very down - it was really quite pathetic if I do say so myself.  But - hey - even a diva can have a moment of weakness!  Then I opened up my e-mail this morning and was reminded once again that I do have friends - really good friends that love me.  They just live to damn far away to be hanging out on my sofa every weekend.  *sign*    But thanks for the little notes and nice thoughts that you send to me.  Just to say hello, or to give me a word of inspiration - all of those little things mean a lot to me - especially after the weekend that none of you could have possible known about.  Just giving thanks because I'm feelin' the love ;)  Diva out.
AAARRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!   I just realized that I have lost all the work that I did on this thing!!!  Blogger did some maintenance work which caused me to get error messages on my page.  So, I downloaded the template again to fix the error.  And I lost my weather tramp, and my tag board, and my favorite links!  This is worse than someone stealing my car (although I really wish someone would) or something.    I think I need to be alone for a few minutes with my grief...  Then I will just have to rebuild.
Well, i just realized that the 'Computer Features' link below doesn't actually work.  Sorry, i didn't mean to tease, it just came out that way.   I think that weather tramp is rubbing off on me. *wink*
Happy Friday!  The diva is back... sorry for the delay.  I've been trying to get work done here in the office, while not really having any desire to get work done.  Spoke to Dee in Alybamy the other day - while she was recieving a visit from Isidore.  All is well in the D2 household.  And there have been so many distractions lately, my focus has been a little off these days.  Suffice it to say that all my efforts at destroying the pattern of 'booty calls' were put on hold for a short time.  But, I'm back on track and stronger than ever  *that slight hesitation in my voice means nothing.*   I could give more sordid details, but with that  and  that weather tramp over there, I would really be pushing for an adult-rated page. *wink*  However, you will notice that I did get some surfing in, and I've added the links for your enjoyment - or not.    Many thanks to my dear friend Mona for introducing me to the newest technology.  I think I need an upgrade...  urlLink Computer Features     urlLink hooey   Diva out.
Scary  Ok, just for kicks I decided to check out  urlLink Juan is a loser   again.  He's getting pretty scary; and what's worse is that some of his meanderings are vaguely familiar.  He's got it bad; he's an online stalker.  Lucky for both of them that the stalked is on the other side of the planet.  Its almost dark enough to be Dostoevsky, but not nearly brilliant enough.  Just the underbelly of a broken heart, exposed for all to see.    I told you,  scary .  Diva out.
Monday again.   I wasted a perfectly good weekend doing absolutely nothing -- again.  Ah, but what pleasure I get from doing nothing.  Slept waaaay too much on Saturday and then refused to be such a sloth again on Sunday.  I actually cleaned my apartment, did some laundry and went food shopping.  Which, in mother-speak, translates into picked up so the kids can mess up, washed what will be dirty again and too small very soon, and spent money I didn't have on something that won't last more than a few days.    So, I actually did a lot of nothing for nothing.
Blog surfing again    Next Blog is like a remote control for the internet.   click -  urlLink Candygenius.com   Have to remember to add this one to the list of Blogs of Like... click -  urlLink  fetish - a thing of magick  ... click - some blog about texas hill people...click... some organization's blog - don't like that... click -  urlLink Silflay seems clever...    Enough surfing.  Is the internet becoming a replacement for the 'idiot box'?  Need to turn this damn thing off and get some work done.  Happy Friday.  And I tried to make the pillow dance... I wanted to make it dance.  Why won't it dance?  Diva out

Cleaning House   First of all, thanks to Birth Control? for this fabulous offering.  If you love popping bubble wrap, I just know you're gonna dig this...  urlLink Virtual Bubble   Now, for the subject of the day... Cleaning House.  Has absolutely nothing to do with bubble wrap (although I did find some forgotten bubble wrap tucked away in a closet).  But that's besides the point.  For some odd reason, I don't do 'spring cleaning'.  The urge comes later in the year - right around now.  Or maybe its early; depends on how you look at it - half full, half empty.  So, the urge struck me Saturday and I struck back by spending about 6 hours clearing out cards, letters, old drawings from my kids, WEDDING GIFT CARDS.  Even found the bill from the hotel on the wedding night.  *sigh*    I got rid of 4 big bags of what used to be treasured memories.  Now they're just junk to load into the landfill.  And I can't tell you how gooooood it felt ripping up a few last straggling pictures of DBD.  Talk about cleaning house - that emotional closet is stripped bare now!    But I won't share too much here - just suffice it to say that I now have lots of happy memories stored away in all my little boxes that I love to collect.   And, I have empty boxes ready to collect all the happiness I have yet to create.  Diva out.

Removing the incurable cancer called hatred Reveals one's undying, undiminishing radiance.  The destruction of hatred, that sorrow of sorrows, Yields to man the joy of joys.  -Tirukkural 86: 853-54
September 11th again  There's a lot in the media this morning about remembering this day.  Some people around me are down, others appear to not even know of the significance of today (although I suspect affected appearances).  Personally, I woke up with the radio reminding me of the sadness of this day, of the impact felt by families around the world and of the continued feeling that nothing has been done still.  A friend spoke to me of the families of the victims, and those of the firefighters and policemen lost in the attacks.  He wasn't concerned with how they've all managed to go on while mouring lost loved ones.  His point was that firefighter and police families have received $900,000 in financial relief while victims' families have 'only' recieved on average $100,000 in relief.  Something like that - my figures may be off.  He was disturbed at the unbalanced totals of money.  So, I'm wondering... why is it that a living family member has no dollar value.  You can't buy that loved one for any amount of money.  No decent mother would sell her child to someone (these days) no matter how many hundreds of millions of dollars you offered her.  Why is it, that once a family member is killed all of a sudden there is a dollar value placed on the life of that person?    I believe that the dollar value is not to replace the loss of that person - for no money can do that.  I think it has more to do with revenge - 'they're going to pay!'.  But, in the greater scope of things, that way of thinking is very base and has nothing to do with honoring the life and memory of the one lost.  It is hate and anger reacting and trying to take control of a situation over which we have no control.    It saddens me that the attacks happened and I do believe we should remember those that were lost and remember the hate that caused such actions.  Doing so may guide us all to a world where violence does not answer violence and knowledge erases hate and prejudice.    I am determined to have a good day and to be grateful for all that I have - even the challenges that cause me strife!    Diva out.
The key to happiness  I've discovered the key to sublime happiness.  It's butter.  A little sugar never hurt either.  But, note the butter to happiness ratio... the more butter, the happier you will be.    Stay with me on this.  Just think about the last stack of pancakes you had; lots of butter, right?  And didn't you feel soooo good after wolfing down the stack?  Or that warm, flaky biscuit that you dunked in butter at the dinner table.  Complete and utter bliss.    Personally, I had the most divine croissant *using your best french accent - say craa - san'* this morning.  Not only was there butter baked in, so much so that it left my fingers glistening with the magic stuff, but I went one step further and swathed it lovingly in even more butter.  Some may say adding the strawberry jam was going to far, but I say, 'You only live once!'
Thanks, I guess...  Well, I didn't get what I wanted, but I almost got what I wanted.  Had that all important follow up hearing after last week... you know, the one where he's supposed to show up with cash in hand.  What he showed up with was a letter explaining why he didn't have cash in hand.  And another pathetic excuse, which simplified, means his needs are far more important than those of his children.  The judge was fair, as before. She accepted his offer of $500 today - before 2pm.  Then she agreed to reduce the amounts due, but the total will still be $3000 to fulfill his 'purge'.  So, DBD (dead-beat-dad) now has a standing appointment before the Judge of the 11th Circuit County Court for the next 10 weeks.  Fortunately, I will not have to attend.  At first I was so angry that I really wanted to bitch slap him right where he sat.  Then I got over it, took control of myself and rationalized that $500 is better than nothing.  I'm getting paid and he's out of jail, earning more money to give to me.  It works.  So, thanks, I guess...

That weather bitch is getting more action than me!  *sigh*  Hmmm, maybe if I shortened my skirt up to there... * me reaching down and tearing strips off the bottom of my skirt, a la Ginger on Gilligan's Island style *  Had a faaabulous three day weekend wherein I fullfilled my plans of doing absolutely nothing.  Not one damn thing...  I read -- working my way through 'The History of Civilizations' by Fernand Braudel -- and when reading became too tedious I napped on the sofa.  Even got in a really good two hour yoga session... and absolutely relaxing and labor-free Labor Day weekend.  The children were with Grandma and she spent the whole time spoiling them.  In all, a faaabulous weekend; or did I say that already? *grin*
Happy Hallowe'en Everyone!  What a good morning we had in the Diva household... Leia as Jane from Tarzan (Disney's version) and Kala as a witch (again), complete with glow-in-the-dark fingernails with 'Boo!' written on them.  Spoooooky.  Mom will don her wicked witch costume later today, got my magic mirror and all ready to go.  And I have to gloat about last night.  WHAT A GREAT TIME!  The Wine Club last night drew in 55 guests - most of them paying this time - for 'Get a Clue'.  Great wines, gourmet hors d'oeuvres and a terrific mix of people all made for such a great time.  There was a line at the wine bar last night - that was a first. And someone actually figured out the murder mystery and won a bottle of choice from our wine selection; she chose the Gallo(w), a very good choice.  After almost giving up on the whole thing, now I can't wait for next month's event.  I've selected Big Reds, and we may add a scavenger hunt to the evening.  Themes and games seem to draw a crowd.  Today the Diva will need just a little more coffee than usual to make it through to trick-or-treat time.   Diva out.
And, while they may not all work correctly (weebl needs adjusting)... I've managed to get most of my favorite links back!  And I can't wait to visit Laughing Boy again.  I feel at peace. *aaahhhh*  Diva out.
Almost there  I know a lot of people who are counting down the days and dreading the coming of a new year.  Let me assure you that I, for one, am looking forward to getting this year over with.  This was not my best year, not my worst either.  Actually, it was pretty good now that I think of it.  Anyway, I just know 2003 will be MY year.  I'm hoping anyway.  And as my 33rd birthday rounds the corner - yes Dee, we are 33 no matter how hard you try to deny it! - as my birthday rounds the corner I'm thinking it may be time for another image update.    Yes, as the Downtown Diva I am an absolute fox *wink*, I was even called gorgeous recently.  Notice the gloating.   But, there is always room for improvement.  I'm thinking the gray needs to go, as I have probably another 30 or 40 years to sport the gray hair.  And shorter may work too.  Although, I'm kind of digging the shoulder length do.  Hmmm.  10 pounds could go away and I wouldn't miss them at all.    Change is good.  New age, new year, new me.  We're still in the planning stages, so we'll see.   Diva out.
Update on demand  Congrats to Birth Control? for new baby steps!  Now the real fun begins (and more trips to the ER?).  I received an e-mail to please update my blog, so... I'm updating.  Went to a small but fun costume party at Debbie's on Saturday night.  Trying to figure out how to go to another party on Friday night.  I'll have to squeeze it into my busy schedule - this is the week of no free time!  Wednesday is the Wine Club event - 45 RSVP's  -  a record for the year.  Thursday is Halloween.  Kala will be a witch (again) and Leia has decided to be Jane from Tarzan instead of Princess Dot from Bug's Life.  Mom is undecided, but I have a sorceress costume from a friend.  Think evil step mother from Sleeping Beauty... oooh, maybe I'll just add a mirror as prop to the costume and that's who I'll be.    Friday I'm taking the girls - with Grandma too - to a halloween themed carnival.  And then there's the party an hour away.  Phil Berry is all grown up and having a party at his place (with roommate).  That should be interesting and hopefully amusing too.  Saturday is Hands on Miami Day.  Don't forget to click the little donate button (above left) to sponsor me if you haven't yet done so - thanks again Joe!  Saturday night is the Bug Ball, where I will be helping to pour wine for the party.  I'll be sampling a little of my own goods that night, for sure. *wink*  Sunday I'm going to try again to meet with friends for a Japanese tea ceremony - it keeps getting put off.  And somewhere in between I may actually get some sleep.  Loving life as a diva right now. *big grin*  Diva out.
A new friend  My girls don't get visitors at our house very often.  Once we had a pool party to celebrate the end of summer and four girls came over.  That was a lot of fun and it kept both of my girls entertained for the entire afternoon.  Last night we had another such special occasion.  Kala has teamed up for a pumpkin decorating project at school, so Jenny came home with us after school yesterday.  What a great time we all had decorating two pumpkins and turning it all into a jester with a miniature puppet of himself.  Kala and Jenny came up with the idea and I added my idea of the puppet.  Two pumpkins stacked on top of each other with a mini-me stuck onto a chopstick, jutting out from the bottom pumpkin.  It really turned out nicely.  What was the nicest of all though, was working with the girls to put it all together.  And then, having all three girls running around the house, chasing each other, blowing bubbles and creating general havoc.  We had such a good time together.  And on a school night!  Jenny was trying to convince her mother that she needed to sleep over Sunday night just so the two of them could carry the pumpkin into class together on Monday morning.  Mom wasn't buying it.    Kala has such nice friends; I hope she gets to come over and play again soon.  Diva out.
Like this one, maybe more for the look of it than the content.  Also, his resolutions for 2002 are strangely like my own, all but that one about his flat... urlLink ...grayblog... - I don't know you people, why are you here?
The Pinnacle of Celebrity  I'm the Administrative Diva for a gorgeous and glamorous boutique hotel on South Beach.  We are hosting MTV for the Latin VMA's, being held here on Miami Beach.  We have celebrities from all music genres, from Latin American newcomer Anastacia to Carlos Santana.  Yes, we are just that fabulous.  But all that is nothing compared to who I have discovered is being secretly stored away in one of our Boardrooms.  I found the crate this morning declaring his arrival, and I was beside myself with excitement.  Dare I even let it leak that he's here?  Mustn't... tell.... must... resist... urge... to spill it.....  Okay! I have to tell you....  HAMBURGLAR is HERE!  Its just too fabulous to keep to myself!  McDonalds has a crew here doing a commercial and working out of our Boardroom.  And they brought HIM for the shoot.    Wonder if I can get an autograph.  Diva out.

Three to fall down  3 1/2 actually.  I have decided to get Leia a helmet.  I believe that's the only way I'm going to preserve her tender little melon (her head) from serious damage.  She is constantly falling down, and its always on her head and/or face.  Its not because she's clumsy like her mother; she doesn't trip over her own feet or walk into walls.  Ok, sometimes she walks into walls, but that's another day's topic.  She bounces, she jumps... she FLIES.  She jumps on my bed, the sofa, the chair.  And sooner or later she lands on her head.  And she hasn't yet learned that jumping leads to falling.  Last night was a perfect example.    I didn't even see her standing on our particulary bouncy chaise lounge.  She must have done what she always does -- start at the head of the chair, bounce along the length of the lounge and then dive off the end of it onto a huge cushion on the floor.  It scares the hell out of me everytime I see it, but this time I didn't see it.  And this time she missed the cushion, flew right past it head first into the wall and the base of a tall wrought-iron candle holder.    When I find her, she's lying face down, like a little doll shoved into the corner with her head pushed too far to the left.  Miraculously, she was fine.  A little scared, no real damage done.  And then, once the boo-boo was all gone and she had calmed down, we had discussed not jumping on that chair anymore.  She agrees by saying, 'Ok, Mommy.  Let's go jump on your bed better.'  *sigh*   Either I'm going to have a vegetable for a daughter or she's strong enough to live through a nuclear holocaust.  Headgear is the only way to be sure.   Diva out.
Two to Tango   I have a new appreciation for the bandoleon.  It's like an accordian, only bigger and I guess somehow more noble.  It really does go very nicely with a piano, the Tango concert I went to taught me this.  Although, I have to say, watching the guy play the bandoleon was another form of entertainment.  Have you ever  seen  this?  It may be illegal to play this thing in public in some countries.    The musician sits on a chair, with the instrument resting on his lap.  As he moves the thing open and closed it makes a whining, yet pleasing sound.  It can be very gentle and quiet or really strong and loud.  And when it is played loud and long is when the visual entertainment begins.   As the instrument is stretched out to its limits, it becomes too much to hold on a closed lap.  Think Slinky stretched to its extreme - the center starts to droop.  To accommodate this, the player must o-p-e-n his legs w-i-d-e to support the instrument.  Then, add to that the passionate way in which he plays the sharp notes; moving with his whole body and sometimes pushing forward with his shoulders or hips.  The bandoleon singing or moaning and gasping for breath all the time.  No wonder Tango is so damn sexy... the dances were inspired by moves of the musicians!  It really was very exciting and a lesson in traditional music from Argentina and Uruguay.  Just another reason I love living in Miami.  All that culture.   Diva out.
Its the 'head' of Blogger:  urlLink EVHEAD: very, very lucky
this just in...  So, I have a little more to say today.  I have 2 free tickets to a Tango concert/performance tomorrow night and I was a little sad because I thought that I'd have to go alone, and as we all know, it takes two to tango.    I had asked a friend who I thought would be interested in going, but since I hadn't heard back I thought I was going alone... but he IS going with me!   I can get all dolled up and go out with a friend, a male friend.  It's almost like a real date and I couldn't be more pleased.   And, I'm hoping to meet some other friends for a Japanese tea ceremony on Sunday.  It never takes much to make me happy; an e-mail here, a phone call there.  Makes me a happy little Diva.    I'm looking forward to a wonderfully busy weekend, and I wish the same to all my friends!  Diva out!
Not much more to say today than HAPPY FRIDAY!  Did a little blog surfing yesterday, but for some reason the english-written blog channel was broken.  All I got were blogs in french and what I think may have been finnish... All I know is I couldn't read one damn word of it.  Another busy, busy day ahead of me, so I'm going for another cup of coffee and then bravely into the fray!  Diva out.
Tired but happy  I don't know about the rest of you, but I've had the equivalent of two weeks in one.  My office has been so busy I can't keep up or keep track of it all.  I've planned a Wine Club event and sent out 500 invitations (which includes printing the invites and the labels, stuffing, licking and running through the postage meter), done my director of sales' New York sales trip expense report twice, remembered National Boss Day (2 'bosses'), put out several little fires the past three days, booked reservations for several VIP guests (and those who think they're VIP) and even got the hotel to sponsor the wine for an upcoming party at the Miami Beach Botanical Garden.    And all of that has very little to do with my personal life, which by the way, I do actually have.  I'm exhausted.  But, I'm happier than I've been in weeks.  I've got something to do every Saturday for the next 3 weeks, and some Sunday's too.  I'm looking ahead to my birthday weekend and all the arrangements I need to do.  'God' called and wants to spend my birthday with me, and its always nice spending time with him.  I'm getting more involved in volunteering and in the baby's daycare.  I'm having little bedside chats with Kala more often - real mom-daughter bonding time.  And, I'm reconnecting with some of my dearest friends that I have lost track of.  And lets not even mention all the holidays that are coming up.  I'm exhausted, but I'm happy.  Busy is good.    Diva out.
The Glamorous Life?   I live in Downtown Miami, in the lap of luxury... on the 25th floor with a balcony overlooking Miami and the Beaches.  I have a f-a-a-a-a-bulous view of Biscayne Bay and the Ocean -- way over there on the horizon.  Miami is beautiful and draws all the beautiful people.  Movies are made, videos are shot and we are all dripping with glamour.  There are advantages to being a Downtown Diva.  With that in mind, let me tell you about last Friday night.  A production company has been filming 'Fast and Furious 2' for months now, in and around Miami.  They've been filming in my 'hood for the past few weeks.  Yes, glamorous.  Glitzy and fabulous.  Haven't actually seen that yummy Diesel guy, but he's hangin' in my 'hood for filming.    And, last Friday they were filming until the wee hours of the morning - actually they didn't even start until 11pm.  How do I know this, you ask?  I know this because that's when I was going to sleep - or at least I thought I was.  At about 11:30, while falling deep into peaceful slumber, I was violently and rudely awakened by screaming police sirens and screeching tires.  Now, I'm used to sirens in the middle of the night - after all, it is Downtown - but not at this high volume.   After my heart began to beat again, I got up and went out onto my terrace to see what all the commotion was.  It was Fast and Furious 2.  They had closed of the entire 4 blocks of the street one block over for this scene, which apparently involves a high speed police chase outside a strip club.    Also, apparently, they didn't get it right the first time and had to re-shoot the scene around 2am - sirens and tires and all.   So, when you go see this movie (sometime next year probably) and you get to the scene outside a really colorful strip club with a green entrance, know that you're in my 'hood.  And when you hear the screaming sirens and the screeching tires, remember your Diva being ripped from her slumber at 2am when they shot that damn thing!  Ah, the glamourous life.   Diva out.
Monday again.  But not at all a bad day.  Spent my allotted blog-update time working on someone else's blog.  Check out  urlLink Gerbilman Rant  and I'm sure you'll notice my little touches here and there.  Even with a gay man, there's nothing like a woman's touch. *grin*  5pm has come all too soon (sound familiar ladies?)... sorry, I've gotten off track.  What I meant to say it that it's after 5pm now and I have to head out to my other full time job of motherhood.  Diva out.
Hands on Miami Day  I sometimes volunteer with an organization called  urlLink Hands On Miami .  As the brochure says, 'In partnership with United Way of Miami-Dade, Hands On Miami is a non-profit organization that leads 75 group volunteer projects each month including providing companionship to the elderly, reading bedtime stories to homeless children, and restoring the environment'.  Saturday, November 2 is 'Hands On Miami Day' and I will be part of a large group of volunteers doing random acts of kindness as organized by H.O.M.  This is their largest fund-raising effort every year, and I need your help.    You may have noticed that little 'Donate' button at the top of my screen - near my counter.  If you haven't already seen it, I'm sure you're looking at it now.   This fabulous little button can make you a part of Hands On Miami Day without ever having to do any of the dirty work.  By clicking on that button, you will be walked through a process of donating money directly to me as my sponsor.    And if you want a reciept for being my sponsor I will be more than happy to send you one.  I need to collect this money and turn it in on the day of the event, November 2nd.  If you're not comfortable using your credit card over the internet, let me know and I can give you my mailing address - you can even make the check out to Hands On Miami if that will make you feel better.   I hope you will consider being a sponsor for me - I beleive that its really important to try and improve the world around you.  It's like that bumper sticker says -- think globally, act locally.  I'm acting, and I hope you will sponsor and support my action.  If you want to join me for this event, let me know and I'm sure something can be arranged!  Diva out.
Mysterious Stranger  I was ruminating on the latest developments of my blog and its new e-mail address last night.  I was hoping the Birth Control? was a miscellaneous stranger who had been drawn in by my blog content (see the tag board over there for reference).  Then it hit me... I have drawn in at least one random reader!  I feel so accomplished - of course I had to steal her content to get her attention, but hey, whatever works.  And actually, this has lead me to Blogs by Women.  You know me, I'm all about girl power; so of course I've joined the web ring.  It sounds so mysterious and elite, doesn't it?  Web ring... I'm picturing women dancing around in circles in the forest worshipping their goddess Bonni the web ring leader.  I feel so dark and mysterious.  LOL  - no longer just one divine diva, but one of many!  So, thanks for the connection Eliz.  Diva out.
Ok, so I've added Life on the Ridge to my list of faves.  Gerbilman Rant is about to be removed, since he hasn't updated that thing in a-g-e-s.  Must be all the slow-paced country living... nothing to rant about.  Must be nice.   And if anybody has the link to Laughing Boy I would really like to visit him again.
My Soapbox  One of the benefits of a blog is that you can speak your mind and blather on for hours and hours about whatever it is that you think is ruining the world at large.  And I feel a little blathering coming on...  I have, of late, noticed in the course of conversations when the speaker categorizes other people, or themselves for that matter.  I.E. - 'We 'colors' are like that.'  I swear a man actually said that to me; granted he was from an older generation that grew up in segregation.  Sadly he apparently still lives in that world.    But I had it yesterday from someone closer to my own age group; and he had a box for every race you can think of.  The jews this, the argentinians that; even 'we puerto ricans...'.  Maybe its just me in my own little utopian mind, but I try to not categorize people based on color, religion or nationality - or anything else for that matter.  In my world, people are people.    And that's something I love about the internet and the blogs you can find on Blogger.  There are no color lines, no country boundaries, no geographical limits.  The internet highway transcends the physical limits we experience in our every day lives.  Yes, you can find a lot of hate and ugliness (like that  Shudder  e-mail I recieved today - man was that ugly!).  But generally, when you look at a blog, you don't necessarily see the color of the author or the sexual preference or the nationality or even what country they live in.  You see the blog and the ideas and life experiences expressed.  You are given information to determine how you feel about the person writing.  Just something to think about next time you start to shove someone into a categorical box.  People aren't buttons and tacks to be placed in boxes with labels - if they were you could be sure Martha Stewart would be selling the boxes AND the labels for neat little packaging.   I will not be packaged.    *now quietly and humbly stepping down from my soap box* Diva out.
I got an e-mail the other day with re: blog in the subject line.  I don't know if it was spam or a real message regarding my divine and divalicious web log.  So, I have created a very special e-mail address just for my blog.  Now, when you click on 'Show me love' (or whatever clever little ditty I put down there) for sending me a message, it will magically be sent to my new e-mail address.  Ok, ok, I know you're just dying to know the address - downtowndiva9@hotmail.com.  I love e-mail.  Diva out.
Gotta love South Beach  Everyone who knows me, knows I work on South Beach.  I used to live on South Beach, but there's some law here that you can only live here if you're willing to piss your life away in a night club taking large amounts of alcohol and ecstasy.  Soooo, I had to leave.  But I am allowed to work here.  And my hotel receives this glamorous, shiny magazine called Lincoln Road.  It's all about the businesses, restaurants, clubs and people on and around Lincoln Road - a glorified strip mall here on the beach.  It's full of pretty people doing fabulous things - dancing, drinking, eating and loving life.  And this month, one of the hot articles listed on the cover is touted as follows:     Club Lust  The urge to merge and sex between patrons   And the highlighted quote from the article: 'I've walked into DJ booths above the dance floors and seen girls under the control panels making the DJ's happy.' Manny Hernandez, Photographer  Gotta love South Beach - either love it or leave it, as they say.  *grin*  Diva out.
Monday blues   But, actually I'm not really very blue.  Feeling pretty good today.  Spending time with Leia yesterday may have something to do with it.   She is such a trip these days; she's only 3 but she speaks so clearly and expresses herself so well.   And she'll say hello to just about anyone, as long as mommy is close by.    Hmm, wonder if that would work to pick up men; guys use the baby decoy thing to pick up women, but I somehow don't think it works the same with men.  Although, I did have a man chat me up at the gas station; Leia wanted to drive and he said, 'Let her drive.  She can't be any worse than the old people around here.'  And then he smiled at me.  Hmmm....   Anyway, our new thing at home is to NOT say 'Hey!' because 'Hey' is for horses, according to Leia.  So I say it just to make her crazy.   Once when she was acting more like a wild animal than a girl I said, 'Hey, cut it out!'   Leia replied, 'Hay is for horses' and I said, 'Yeah, well, you're acting more like a horse than a girl, so I can say 'Hay!'.  She had no reply other than to weakly repeat herself, 'Hey is for horses, mommy.'  Now, everytime I say 'Hey' to someone, as in 'Hello' I automatically think of Leia's reprimand.   Ah, the things we learn from our children.  Diva out.
Surfing again brought me to  urlLink Life on the Ridge .  Just had to share this entry - hope she doesn't mind...  Wednesday, October 02, 2002    little boy blue  I have a horrible tendancy to lecture. This morning I lectured Michael on how important it is to pick up his trains (Toby likes to chew on them). I must have been extraordinarily long-winded.  Michael looked up at me and very seriously said, 'Shut your pie-hole, Mom, bitte!'  He spent three minutes on the boring time-out bench and then had to pick up his trains. I put them out of his reach.  No child of mine will get away with being disrespectful to an adult!  Now shut YOUR pie-hole. Your giggling is plucking my last nerve.
And the birthday countdown has begun  So, 59 days till my birthday and I just booked myself into the fabulous  urlLink  Mandarin Oriental Hotel & Spa   overlooking Biscayne Bay.  Ah, luxury king room, spa amenities and a full day at their pampering spa.   Now if I could just secure a special guy to share this fabulousness with. *sigh*  Or maybe I'll just invite about six of my closest friends and we'll have a sleep over - a la those Ft. Lauderdale days!  hmmm, now that's an idea! :)  Diva out.
The sickness is spreading...  I have a new link to add to my gone but not forgotten Favorite blogs list.  Now if only I had a Favorite Blogs list *sigh*  D2 has a blog!  Check her out in all her fabulousness!  But be careful,  urlLink she may provoke you!   On another note, Autumn is here in Miami.  The air is a little crisp and sweet smelling, the ocean is the perfect temperature for swimming now, and the wind is picking up.  I love this part of the year in Miami.    And only 60 days to my birthday ;)  Diva out.
Having a great day!   Penny at  urlLink Wilhelmina  ROCKS!  Just got the best flower arrangement, and it smells soooooo good.  What girl doesn't love getting flowers!  Diva out.
You say it's your birthday...  It's my birthday too! (tomorrow, actually)   It is any wonder I'm the Diva that I am... look who else celebrates a birthday this week!  November 26: Tina Turner - the most vivacious and completely alive woman there ever was November 27: Jimi Hendrix - one of the most powerfully creative and vibrant souls to show up as a mortal November 29: Garry Shandling - this must be why I get his jokes  November 30: Ben Stiller - yet another great creative mind - and again, I get his jokes December 01: Bette Midler - The Divine Ms. M - she knew early on that she is a Diva! December 02: Britney Spears - Diva in training - and no matter how much you try not to like her, you do.  Diva out... for now.
And another thing.  I've added the little 'Comment' trick to my page.  Feel free to click on the word 'Comment' at the end of an entry and give me your comments.  Nobody has to know, it will just be between the two of us.    Go ahead, you know you want to.    Diva out.
Ugh, haircut  Everytime I get my hair cut, I'm reminded of why I don't get my hair cut very often.  I'm talking like once every 7 or 8 months.  I can't take the added stress and grief any more often than that.  So, I took the plunge and went to the salon yesterday.  I know that as a reigning Diva, I should practically LIVE in the salon. But I don't.  Because not only am I a Diva, but I am also a single mom, and let's face it -- kids are expensive!  But, being that my  BIRTHDAY IS ON SATURDAY  I decided to pamper myself.  That and the fact that my hair was strangely reminiscent of cousin It.    Nothing drastic, no major chopping was done.  But, why is it that as soon as I get home I realize that I liked my hair the way it was.  I ultimately decide that I don't like what was done and that I could have done a much better job with hedge clippers and saved myself the 50 bucks I just spent.  Then, I almost always grab my scissors and destroy what I just spent 50 bucks on.  I try to resist the urge, but it is overwhelming and I almost always give in to just a few little snips here and there.  And then, finally, I come to the realization that in a few weeks it will grow back and I will be just fine.  *ugh*  BTW, did I mention that my  BIRTHDAY IS ON SATURDAY ?  Diva out.
I've lost it  Well, I was going to tell you all about my escapade in the men's bathroom Friday night, but I guess that will have to wait.  *she said teasingly as she quickly changed the subject*   Last night I lost it.  I may have totally blown my chance for 'Mom of the Year' Award after last night's scene.  I have a cold right now.  My two wonderful and loving daughters were sick a few weeks ago - I missed a few days of work to care for them - and now its my turn to be sick.   Of course, I would never miss work to take care of myself. So, I worked yesterday while nursing a full blown cold, then went home to cook dinner, empty the dishwasher, load the dishwasher, give the little one a bath, entertain my now very healthy children and then get them settled into sleep mode.  With a full blown cold.  After rocking the little one to sleep for 35 minutes, I laid her in her cute little toddler bed.  That's when she looked at up me and said she wanted her 'sippy cup' -  warm milk from a cup to help her fall asleep - when she was already asleep before I laid her down.  At first I thought to resist because I was sick and tired and sooooo ready for sleep.  But I knew that would only prolong my misery, so instead I wigged out.  'Fine! Let's get a sippy cup!' I bellowed at the top of my hoarse and scratchy voice.  I stormed out of the bedroom, leaving the little one stunned in her bed, and tromped into the kitchen.  Tore open the fridge, banged the sippy cup on the counter - it was a full-fledged tantrum.  I calmed down when Kala walked in to see what was wrong with me.    I felt like a three year old without a mommy, but then Kala gave me a little hug and I apologized for being such a brat.  I told her that I'm sick and want my mommy to take care of me!  She thought that was kind of funny, but then tried to find ways to sympathize with me.  Didn't make me feel better, but I knew that she was trying.    After my explosion, all was quiet again.  I apologized to Leia and Kala for freaking out, then rocked Leia back to sleep while Kala chatted frantically about her friends until she fell asleep on the sofa.  Then I went to bed and slept like a baby - with a full blown cold.  Diva out.
Happy Monday?  Well, here we are again.  Another Monday... and I have a few things to talk about - I realize that I now look for material for my blog.  Sad, I know.  But, hey, gotta get my kicks somehow. ;)  So, today I have the 'Diva is a hottie' story.  Yes, yes, we have already established that I am a 'foxy' diva.  If you need proof, check the archives for that little obscure test I 'borrowed' from  urlLink Life on the Ridge .  However, I was told a very funny story the other night that I just had to share.  As told by Marvin, I was the center of a scene one day on the street.  Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, I was unaware of the whole thing.  Marvin says he saw me walking around a corner in my fabulous diva-like way (my embellishment - Marvin thought it but didn't actually say it), and when I passed a man was apparently taken by my divaness.  So he thinks out loud to the crowd at the bus stop 'What a hottie!' and begins to skulk behind me making vulgar movements while following closely behind in a 'ooooh baby'-like fashion.  The crowd laughed at him because I was obviously ignoring him.  I ignored him when he walked face first into a pole making a very loud 'clunk' sound with his face.  Marvin says the whole thing was hysterical.  I'm sure it was... I just wish I had been there to see it!  See, I have a tendency to walk with my head up, looking straight ahead, staying very focused on where and how I step.  Because, while my closest friends know that I am the epitomy of style and grace - think Audrey Hepburn... shut up Dee! -- I do tend to be a little...um shall we say, clumsy?  Ok.  I have be known to trip over my own two feet while standing still and a tree has fallen on my head.  So, while this lovely *ahem* gentleman was ogling me in public, I was making sure I didn't fall on my face while stepping lightly over the cracks in the sidewalk!  Just another day in Diva-ville.   Diva out.
Oh, What a night!  Late September, back in 63,.... oh, sorry.  Got a little carried away there.  My mind is sort of wandering aimlessly this morning... must have something to do with too little sleep.  The Wine Club last night was absolutely amazing.  We had about 55 attendees, most of whom were new faces - and very nice looking faces at that.  So many of the 'right' people were here last night, and everyone one of them had a fabulous time.  The final count of empty wine bottles was 47 I think.  Almost a bottle of wine per person, with a never-ending stream of hors d'ouevres.  I buzzed through the crowd all evening long,  meeting new people and saying hello to familiar favorites.    I met a man who bid $2500 on an auction item to take a Wine Tour through Napa Valley - 8 days of nothing but wine and gourmet 5-course dinners each day.  I met a very attractive young man who owns a cigar company - he wants to host cigar & cognac events here.  Let's see, there was the realtor guy who has started attending regularly, sitting with 5 new female friends in the corner; my dear friend who has supported the club from its inception - his wide, soulful eyes alway focus on the crowd as he studies the evening's faces and actions.  Then there's the greek bath house manager who is a party in skin - he's such a wonderfully enthusiastic man, full of joie de vive.  A very rowdy bunch of women drew in our newest Wine Club regular into their little group of raucous fun for the rest of the evening.  And I met the organizer for the International Wine Fair - of which I hope to be a part... the event, not the man.  Although... ;)  All in all, it was a wonderful ending to a pretty good day.  Now I think I'll go get another cup of coffee.  Diva out.
In my 'hood  This is being built right under my nose - literally.  Sits 25 floors down directly beneath my balcony.  When I'm not working, this is where I'll be!    urlLink njoi is coming

I am blessed  Most of us just gripe when things go wrong.  Today, I'm giving thanks for the things that go right.  As a sagittarius, I know that I am the luckiest sign in the zodiac.  I also know that as an optimist, I always see the bright side of everything.  It helps avoid wrinkle lines by not worrying so much.  Today, I was concerned about my gas tank.  I've made a habit out of running on empty lately, and I'm close to that now.  I have to haul my cookies over to Hialeah this evening to drop off the girls at Grandma's house.  I have to then fly back over to the beach to host The Wine Club event at 7:30p.  2 hours sounds like a lot of time, but when you're travelling in Miami during rush hour traffic, its almost not enough time.  So, I'm thinking, 'Who am I going to borrow 10 bucks from?' when I am reminded that I'm doing a notary gig this morning at the hotel next door.  Yes, folks, along with all of my other fabulous abilities, I am a notary.  Closest to politician as I'll ever get.  So, I head over realizing that I'm getting $10 for this.  Exactly what I was hoping to borrow for gas later today.  And, after stamping a few pages for some very good looking, wealthy company Presidents sitting inside a very posh and fabulous hotel cabana room, I'm handed $40 and sent about my merry way.  I left there feeling very blessed indeed.  I'm am constantly reminded that you will get what you ask for, if you ask nicely.  The universe is my provider and I am so grateful for all that I have.  The $40 was just another reminder that what I need comes to me when I need it, and it reminded me of just how fortunate I am.   Feeling very fulfilled today.  Diva out.
Ok. first of all, I am very certain that the little blog roll thing down on the right is just not working.  The little 'blogs that like me' is causing me undue grief; here I am thinking nobody likes me *diva pouting pitifully*.  now i've come to the conclusion that the damn thing must not be working, because I personally crept into  urlLink Fred's blog  and put in a reference to myself and that little counter thing didn't catch it.  So, I'm taking off the page until I can figure out how to get it to work.  I will not be ignored!  And apparently the bug died, because my friend is doing a little better today.  Diva out.
Sombody's got a bug up her ass today!   As an administrative diva, I live to serve.  I know that some people don't want to do certain mundane things themselves so they get me to do them.  I do it all, its my job.  And I usually do it with a smile.  Today, however, someone apparently has a problem with me.  Maybe she had too much (or not enough) alcohol and/or prescribed drugs last night.  I don't know, but she's in a mood.    First of all, she strolls into the office at 1pm - later than her usual 11am ETA.  Then, she flips out because the contract she promised to someone yesterday is in her mailbox for proofing.  She could have turned a few degrees to her right and faxed the contract to her client without incident.  Instead, she climbed the two flights of stairs and crossed the hall to my desk, where she threw the contract onto my desk for me to fax.    A terse voicemail about another client (which I had already handled) and a phone call to me about an e-mail she never received - while the rest of our staff managed to get it - and the day is only just beginning.  I have to remember that work is my blessing.  I may just laugh at her next attempt to make me as miserable as she is today.  Diva out.
Not impressed  It's cold today.  62 degrees here on the beach, and 57 whereever it is that my little weather tramp over there lives.  The airport I guess.  And she's not even wearing a sweater.  I guess when you're that hot, you don't need wool.    Anyway, this is NOT why I live in Miami.  57 degrees is in no way tropical.  I know so many northern transplants here in Miami are overjoyed at the drop in temperature.  It's crisp and lively and the air is fresh.  Whatever.    All I know is I'm looking forward to warmer weather again.  If I wanted cold, I'd have chosen to live somewhere north.  Give me a good, muggy August afternoon at 95 degrees and let me live happily in Miami.  This cold crap is for the (snow)birds!  Diva out.
Happy Friday!   It is a happy Friday here in paradise.  At least that's what I'm going to keep telling myself until I believe it.  However, upon learning some very important news this morning I have reached the decision that some things have got to change.  And it will take more than a little hair color to fix.  I have to give up ice cream. *gasp!*  I know.  I know. Its a very drastic step.  My mind is screaming like a defiant two year old, 'No! I won't do it.'  But I must.  That and I will continue further along the path toward a vegetarian diet.   I know, its almost more than I can cope with.  But, apparently, while I was focusing on my emotional and spiritual well-being with yoga, meditation, books and the like, I forgot about my physical health.  Now my cholesterol is at 230 (200 is safe) and triglycerides are at... Dave, a drumroll please... 300. (100 is safe!)  And what with my paranoia regarding heart disease, I need to get back on track with a healthy diet and a little more cardio-related exercise.    Anybody know any yummy tasting, rich and creamy, Ben-and-Jerry's-ish fat-free, cholesterol-free ice cream?  Fat chance!    Diva out.
Didn't fall out of my tree!  Fred wondered if I had fallen out of my tree.  No, but I was out of the office for several days.  The littlest pinecone (Leia) has been sick since last Thursday.  Fever from 100 to 102 for about 5 days straight with a cough.  Her usual wonderful doctor, Dr. Leitner 'the nice lady doctor' wasn't in on the day I took Leia into the office.  The doctor who did see her couldn't find anything wrong with her, except a slight fever and a little chest congestion.   Duh.  No medicine prescribed, and I usually prefer to avoid antibiotics and such when they aren't needed.  However, in the meantime, I've missed about 3 days of work.    And just when I was beginning to wonder what damage a prolonged fever could do to a 3 year old brain, Leia started getting better.  She is in school today and feeling better somehow.  I'm back in the office, buried under a pile of work and endless voicemails asking if I've done this thing or that, where's that thing or the other.  My answer is the same.  I haven't really been here since last Thursday, so I haven't done it and I don't know where it is!  Diva out.
Gardening 101  I spoke to my mom today.  I'm sure she thinks I'm strange.  I asked her to send me a pinecone.    There a little hard to come by in Downtown Miami, and I asked her to send me one.  'Why?' you ask. *while thinking I'm a little strange, too*  I've been reading a great book called 'Teachings of Love' by this amazing Vietnamese Buddhist Monk *my strangeness reveals itself*.  In one chapter, he discusses how we are a part of our family and our family is a part of us.  Sometimes, when we stand apart from our family (especially here in the West), we can become confused.  We can suffer like a tree that has become uprooted when we sever the roots of our family.    And that's me in a nutshell.  Family has been a collection of people that had very little to do with who I am and what I am.  Then I realized that's not true.  While I'm not a branch or a flower on the tree, I am still part of that family tree.  I'm a pinecone.  I've left the tree, but its still in me, made me who I am, and I am still part of the tree.  I'm a pinecone, taking the nature of that family with me, and growing my own roots somewhere else.  Continuing my family with a family of my own.  So today, I asked my mom to send me a pinecone as a reminder of who I am.  I tried explaining it to her.  I'm sure she thinks I'm strange.  And I can only guess what fodder I've provided for Fred Gerbilman.  But at the risk of sounding strange, I'll end by saying 'Spiritual lesson over for today, grasshopper.'  Diva out.
Having a fussy day.  Not only did I just add  urlLink Fussy  to my blogroll.  As I was surfing using that beloved NextBlog button, I came across  urlLink Icrywolf  and what do find but the same picture of a cat with a clown painted on its butt... taken from Fussy.  What are the odds of that?
Wasted Talent  My kids don't always get my jokes.  Granted, I don't think of really funny stuff all the time, but when I do my kids just don't get it.  Leia brought home a book from the daycare on Friday, a 'math for kids' book.  It's titled 'Give me Half'.  I saw the title and told Leia, 'Yeah, you'll need to know that for a little later in life, honey.'  I giggled to myself at how clever I was.  Nobody else got it. *sigh*  Diva out.
New Toy!  Thanks  urlLink Candy !  I now have a shiny new referrer list just below the blog roll.  I just love tech toys - especially the free ones.  Quick - make a reference on your blog to diva-licious and you may be the first one listed on my new referrer list!  Go, do it now!    Diva out.
And the Diva is so IN!  Just when I was starting to envy Gerbilman and his rapidly growing audience... Candy Genius lists the Diva as a 'Sweet Blog'.  Is that cool or what?  I could have been there for days, I just never thought to check the list.  I feel like one of the cool kids now.    And she has this nifty little list at the bottom of her page that lists where her blog has been referenced. That is sooooo cool.  Wish I could do that.
Candy's Ballerina Boy  I've got a bit of a sweet tooth, so stopped by Candy Genius for a little something.  Maybe I shouldn't have stolen this  urlLink candy corn , but I couldn't resist. ;)
Old Reliable  Every morning as I drive over the causeway, I see this man running.  He's not running away from anything, he's just running.  And not just on sunny mornings; in rain and cold he's out there.  I've seen him as early as 8:10am, and as late as 10:15am.  So, he jogs back and forth over the two causeway bridges for at least 2 hours every day.  And I can't help but wonder why.  I feel like stopping my car, getting out on the side of the road and asking him.  What motivates him to do this?  Why could jogging possibly be so important to him?  He gets out of his bed very early every morning and devotes several hours of his precious time to this task.  As much as I love running, I'm lucky if I get a good 4 miles of running in once a month. He does this EVERY DAY.  I'm just amazed at how some people can be so dedicated to their principles.  So steadfast and reliable in their everyday routines.     I'm sure I'll have more to say today - I'm feeling very chatty.  So, Diva out... for now.
Stunned and Amazed  What kind of sub-human robs a  church?   I hope they find out, because someone broke into the church where my youngest goes to daycare.  Imagine my uncertainty when pulling into the driveway as I counted 4 news vans and a crime scene unit parked in front of the church.  I've seen news trucks there before.  When the Elian thing happened, the nun who was helping him was holed up in a mansion across the street to hide from the media and the protestors.  All of that in front of the church and daycare that had no connection to any of it.  I had to take my daughter out early that day for safety.  So today I was wondering what could have happened, and would Leia be safe.    Turns out some creep broke in to the church, the church office and the daycare office looking for -- ?? Money?? The thief apparently didn't find the cash stored away in the daycare office, because its still there.  The pastor's car was taken however.     It's just shameful.  I'm sorry for the pastor and the violation she must be feeling.  I know it sucks to have someone come in and touch your stuff, let alone  take  your stuff.  But I also feel sorrow for the thief.  How low do you have to be to break into God's house?  Even if its not your religion,  it's God's house!   And I wonder if the thief figured the pastor wouldn't press charges if caught - you know, forgiveness and all that.  HAH!  Even Jesus displayed 'righteous indignation'.    Just a sad thing to see first thing in the morning.  Diva out.
urlLink Gay Sheep    I'm not sure if I find this helpful or not.   This is my favorite part of the  urlLink article...   'First the scientists watched the sheep to be sure of their behavior  something that cannot be done with humans. Then they took apart their brains.'    You can't watch human behavior, but you can take apart their brains.  Why does that not sound right to me?  Diva out.
I'm back.   I'm not dead, although chocolate is always welcomed.    Just been super busy, which of course means I've been super happy.  As mentioned, Wednesday's Wine Club event was fabulous.  Halloween trick or treating was a blast.  Went door to door in a quiet little neighborhood and the girls got lots and lots of treats.  Friday I was supposed to go to a party, but I just didn't have the strength to make the 60 mile drive.    Saturday was Hands On Miami Day; I was assigned to painting a mural in a Salvation Army homeless shelter.  I must say that I was very impressed with the comfort and cleanliness of the shelter - it was more like a nursing home, but with mothers and children.  Made me feel good just knowing that these children - very much like my own - were safe with a roof over their heads.  Just gave me the warm & fuzzies --  no smart ass comments, Joe!   Saturday night was the Bug Ball, where my Wine Club sponsored the wine for the party.  Very nice collection of socialites and party-goers together for the good of the garden.    Sunday I stayed in bed till noon - I just didn't have the energy to get up until then.  Monday was catch up time in the office, and I'm finally back on track and on-line.  So, no Joe.  I'm not dead, but you can send chocolates if you want!  Diva out.
Very Interesting...  Check this out to see  urlLink  what 2003 has in store for you!    Couldn't hurt.  Hope 2003 is a good one for all of my internet friends!  Good being defined as better than the last 2 or 3!  Diva out.
Last complaint this year!  I promise after this, I won't complain for the rest of the year ;)  It hasn't really rained in weeks, and my blue car was the color dirt.  So I spent 30 minutes and 3 dollars on a car wash last night.  There's a 70% chance of rain today. Figures.  And, why is it, that no matter how many times you explain something to someone; tell them, put it in written memo as a standard procedure, ask them, beg them... it just never gets done right.  Arrgh!  Considering it was concering reservations for New Year's Eve, and I no longer (nor ever did) have a handle on it all, it would now be moot to complain.  So I don't even get to growl at anyone to fix it, because its just about over for another year.  Growl, growl.  Diva out.
Old Dog?  Still learning new tricks... tried roller blading for the first time yesterday.  Little sister sent me a pair for christmas.  And much to my surprise, and to the chagrin of the lookers-on, I did not fall down.  Went around the block three times with Leia at my side, riding her bike.  Didn't fall once.  Nice to know that I'm not too old to learn new things.  Diva out.
Something to Ponder  From  urlLink Friday Five :  1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year? Toss up between getting into my own apartment in January and getting child support.  2. What was your biggest disappointment? DBD losing his job after only 3 months, thereby losing my child support.  3. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions?  Yes - to create stronger bonds with the people I know & love.  4. Where will you be at midnight? Do you wish you could be somewhere else?  Working at my hotel, standing on Miami Beach watching fireworks with glass of champagne in hand - and I get paid to do this!  5. Aside from (possibly) staying up late, do you have any other New Year's traditions?  I just believe that whatever you are doing on NYE sets the theme for the new year.  And for my own thoughts, not ones borrowed from  urlLink Eliz     Things I've learned this year.  1. How to get the child support & judicial system to work without the aid (?) of a lawyer. 2. That I could very easily become the same kind of parent that my parents were - egad!  3. How to be mindful of what I say and do and how to think/speak only loving things. 4. That people who move away do not necessarily leave me behind. 5. I have abandonment issues. 6. 2002 was difficult and I still managed to keep my head up and smile through it all. 7. Yoga is life.  I believe that every day is a lesson to be learned and each year is just another opportunity to create more love and joy in our lives.  So, what did 2002 teach you?  Diva out.
Sigh of relief  Well, thank god that's over!  Christmas Day is history.  Surprisingly, it was a great day... the best that I can remember.  I always had this idea of what I would like Christmas to be, but every year the day left me disappointed.  This one left me feeling satisfied instead.  We went to two Christmas Eve dinners, one Cuban and one Mexican - both with pork.  Very yummy and lots of fun with friends, old and new.  My girls are growing into true party girls - we were out until 2am and they managed to be in good moods the whole time.   On Christmas morning, they were up at 7:30am so I was up at 7:31am.  Didn't get to bed until 3am.  Ouch.  But there were so many gifts under the bamboo tree for them (thanks to my parents, my brother, my sister & her husband), and even a few for me!  I got some of the best gifts ever - including a beautiful pair of opera glasses (I've been wanting a pair for a few years now), a digital camera and Oscar de la Renta perfume & cream (Thanks Tony!).  And we spent Christmas Day with my family in Palm Beach. Grandma, aunts, uncles, cousins all from my mother's side of the family.  Even though they only live 2 counties away, I never see them.  Its a stange thing about Dade County.  People who don't live here rarely come here.  People who do live here rarely leave.    But it was a great day for sure.  Family, turkey, presents and carols and more desserts than we could possibly finish in one day.    I hope that your day was just as nice ~ that no matter what you did, you enjoyed it completely.  Diva out.
Quick, refer to Diva-licious in your blog!  Go now!  I want to see if this thing (the referrer) works.  At least my page isn't blank!  Diva out.
Fa-la-la-la-la  Christmas cards are out, cookies are all hand-delivered at work.  Even the little books of quotes are delivered.  I've been a busy little diva!  Also, I took my girls to Brunch with Santa on Saturday - a very nice gift from one of my co-workers.  Actually, Saturday was Holiday Day in my little family of girls.  After Santa, we went to the mall with money from Mom and bought the girls each a new outfit.  Crowds were bad, but not unpleasant.  And the sales were good.  Even got to see a special holiday show in cirque du soleil style.    After being 'malled', we went to a Holiday-themed carnival here in Downtown Miami, replete with glowing palm trees and neon Magic City Miami sign!  There was a traditional holiday village with Santa and his reindeer and the little snow-painted houses, along with lots of rides and stuff, with holiday music in the background.  They even had an ice-skating rink (fake of course) along Biscayne Bay.  With the boat parade and full moon over the Bay behind, it made for quite a memorable evening.  I do love Miami, and I'm in the holiday mood, in spite of myself.  Diva out.
Bah Humbug  I'm one of those people who waits until Christmas Eve to do all their shopping.  I do love the rush of a deadline, and of course I usually don't have any cash to spend until the payday before Christmas anyway.    Here in our little slice of paradise, where I work, we get paid on every other Thursday.  I was thinking that since the Holiday was on Wednesday we would get paid on Tuesday.  Then, I was informed that payroll was being done one day early - so I figure that was to allow for payday on Tuesday.  Wrong!  Apparently, while I thought I was working for a nice person, I am in actuality working for Mr. Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Payday will be on Thursday, as usual.  The day AFTER Christmas. *sigh*  So, to date I have bought exactly one Clifford wristwatch and I have 'acquired' a Vanessa Carlton CD.  And with my mother-in-law and her entire family (including DBD) in New Jersey supporting the family after the tragedy, there isn't much of a Christmas to look forward to.  Thankfully,  my mom & sister have played Santa this year and sent me SEVERAL boxes of gifts for the girls (and even a little something or two for me) So it won't be a total dissappointment (I hope).  Chin up, chest out, faking a cheerful holiday smile.  Diva out.
I refuse to be beaten by HTML tags!  I shall overcome!  Diva out.
Better today  Feeling relief today, for no real reason other than I am just grateful.  For every little thing that bothered me yesterday my inner voice reminded me that at least I didn't start the day by dying.  *and don't worry, I don't have little voices in my head, Fred*  I just kept reminding myself of how fortunate I am in everything.  And I was reminded that, even though I do have serious money problems which I expect to become more serious in the next few months - thanks to the unemployed DBD - sometimes money doesn't matter.  There are other problems in life.  I kissed and hugged my girls more than usual yesterday evening.   Stood outside on the balcony, 25 floors above Miami last night.  Stared out at the twinkling stars that are the city lights below me and silently gave thanks for all that I have.  Diva out.
Grumble Grumble  1. My left bra strap keeps falling and is driving me crazy! 2. I officially hate all copiers and printers in my office.  If one of them would work properly for more than a day, I would be overjoyed. 3. I have gone way over my chocolate quota for the week, all this morning.  I feel like I could explode at any moment from chocolate overload.
On a more positive note  What I wanted to write about this morning, before the tragic news...  If anyone had ever told me that one day I would bake 24 miniature pumpkin pies, and then lovingly wrap each one first in cellophane and then in paper tied with a ribbon, I'd think they'd lost their mind.  Now, I think I have.  Because that's what I was up doing until 11pm last night.  Painstakingly and lovingly done as gifts for everyone that has become special to me this year.  Sunday I baked 6 dozen cookies, tonight I'll bake another 10.  And then lovingly wrap each one first in cellophane and then in paper tied with a ribbon.  I never knew I had it in me.  Damn, am I a catch or what?  All fabulous Diva-ness AND I can bake!  Diva out.
Just tragic   I've read all the Dostoevsky novels, those sad and dark tales where people die from chest colds and madness.  That was way back when people used coal for heat in their homes, and travelled by horse-drawn buggy.  This is 2002, almost 2003.  Things like that just don't happen anymore.  At least that's what I thought until now.    I received a phone call this morning on the way to work.  That was my first indication that something was wrong - my cell never rings in the morning.  It was my mother-in-law, who only calls in the morning  to be the first to wish her granddaughters a happy birthday.  Today was not a birthday.  Bad news was her reason for calling today.  As I listened, she explained that her brother called her today, first thing in the morning.  She had the same thought - he never calls that early in the morning, not even for birthdays.  Bad news was his reason for calling.  Their 20 year old daughter had caught a cold a few days ago, and was feeling having trouble breathing last night due to the congestion.  She went to sleep last night, woke up this morning unable to breath.  The ambulance was called and she was taken to the hospital, but sometime this morning she died.    Unbelievable, incredulous, impossible news.  I don't understand how this can happen.  I was dumbstruck and griefstricken all at the same time.  I wasn't very close to her, but she is my mother-in-law's niece, and very loved in our family.  This isn't some Dostoevsky novel, this is our life.  Death has touched our family and I don't know what to do about it.  I want to console my mother-in-law in her loss but I don't even know where to begin.  Before she hung up with me she asked me to take very good care of her girls (my daughters).  I told her of course I would.    I may have more thoughts on this later today, but I feel like just putting this into my blog may help relieve some of the sadness in my heart somehow.  And of course, as I always dwell on things in a philosophical manner, I am sure I will have more to say on this later.    Once the shock has worn off.  Diva out.
Almost perfect   The Diva had a date.  I know, you're thinking, 'Of course she did.  As fab as she is, she must go out on dates all the time.'  Yeah, whatever.  Anyway, I was invited to a holiday party on Saturday night, and I have to say it was one of the best dates I have been on in years, perhaps ever.  We went to a company holiday party, where I sat at a boring table with extended warantee salesmen and a very spoiled wife.  Listened to a speech about how great the 'team' is doing, yadda yadda.  The most interesting part was when I met a guy who went to my high school and graduated 11 years before me.    But I got to dance to one of my most favorite slow songs ever, 'Lady in Red' - I just love that song and I've never had the opportunity to dance to it (with another person that is).  And my friend was funny and charming and such a gentleman.  Helped me with my coat, made sure I was comfortable, offered to get me drinks from the bar.  Just the perfect date.  Then, he took me to a Wine Bar, owned by a friend of his.  Now, not only am I a diva, but my alter ego is a wine diva!  So, I was in heaven!  They had a wine list to die for!  After drooling over the list, I selected a glass of a French Chardonnay called Fat Bastard.  I couldn't resist the name!  It was really very good.    We sat outside, in very chilly weather, and kept cozy next to a wood burning stove and talked for a long time.  It was such a great evening, and he thanked me for making his night so special.  Sounds great, right?  Well, as this entry's title implies, it was almost perfect.  Unfortunately, I don't see this friend in a romantic light.  He's very nice, attractive, tall, etc.  But, no chemistry.  Damn, imagine that wood burning stove with a little chemistry.  *sigh*  But, most importantly I was on a date instead of home alone.  And it was a great evening.  Diva out.
Checked my  urlLink 'scope  this morning  Sometimes these things are just so dead on its scary.    'With the sun in your sign, your wish is like a command to the universe but you know what they say about being careful with wishes. Add to that, your imagination is either a source of incredible strength or weakness right now. You could just about manifest anything from a mere thought but before you become the proud new owner of a passing thought, make sure its what you really, really want. Take some time out this morning to imagine that you have your most heartfelt desire. Then what would you do? Remember that half the fun of getting something new is in the hunt, whether its for a job, a love or a new pair of shoes.'  God god, I'm looking for two out of three of those RIGHT NOW (never you mind which two).  And, whether you believe it or not, I already know about making my desires manifest.  I realize that I have an uncanny ability to make myself the 'owner of a passing thought' and have done so on many occasions.  Actually, we all have that ability - we just don't all develop and use it to its fullest potential.  Here's a test - next time your driving in an unfamiliar area, tell yourself you really really want a 7-11, or a Burger King - whatever.  But really really want to see one.  Want to see it because you're testing the universe and your own ability to tap into it.  See if you get what you want.  Freaks me out whenever I try it!  So, just a reminder to always be careful what you wish for.  Like I said before, the universe can have a very twisted sense of humor.  Diva out.
And continuing in today's holiday theme  My weather tramp is sporting a lovely green frock, with a more traditional Christmas tree in the background.  And there are Santa Claus cans in the Coke Machine!  It's official - the holidays are here.  Diva out.
One more thing...  In cleaning up my blog list I am very sad in reporting that I have taken 'hmmm' off the list.  Dee has not updated her blog in a very very long time and I just can see sending people to a blog that gets no love.    And, I thought about taking off 'Juan is a loser', but I somehow find comfort in knowing that he hasn't updated his blog in a very very long time.  Following the story, I would hope that he has gotten over what's-her-name.  Ok, so it's actually three things... cause I want to suggest checking out mimi smartypants if you haven't already.  She is very entertaining, in an ambivalent sort of way.  Diva out.
How many days left?!  I'm not even going to get into the shopping days that are left.  I never shop for Christmas until the 24th anyway.  The holiday spirit just doesn't descend upon me until then.  But it is beginning to look a lot like Christmas around here.  We're making holiday cards this year - an old-fashioned Christmas; and we're baking all of our gifts.  Mini pumpkin pies, sugar drop cookies, pumpkin bread and the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted.  And they ship well, too.  Last night we decided (we being my two children) that it was time to decorate the tree.  Only problem is that we don't have a tree.  Got lost in all the moving over the past 3 years, I guess.  So, I suggested we decorate the bamboo tree on the terrace.  They loved it!  And after we were finished with the tree (we being mostly me this time), it looked pretty good.  Why shouldn't you have a bamboo tree for Christmas in Miami?  We are the epitomy of tropical chic. *grin*  And, if it had been 40 degrees colder last night, it would have snowed.  At 74 degrees, what we got was rain.  Truly a tropical Miami Christmas *sigh*  Diva out.
Beyond Help  Something kind of strange happened last night so of course I had to write about it.  Actually, yesterday was strange in lots of ways.  But nevermind all that.  What I want to write about is how hopeless I think it may be for the DBD now.    I finally decided to clear away any and all feelings of hurt, anger, jealousy and whatever else may be lurking about in my mental garden regarding him.  I then said a little prayer for him and lit an incense to carry my wishes upward.  Do you believe that the incense wouldn't light... and once it did light, it just fizzled out.  It wouldn't burn.  I took it as a sign that even though I've forgiven him, he has some work of his own to do.  So, I asked the incense to bless my work instead.  It burnt for over an hour.  Go figure.  Diva out.
urlLink     Where Did Your Soul Originate?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I kind of already figured this out.  There's a reason I live in Miami!  Diva out.
revenge is mine?  Always thinking and always considering the other point of view... or at least trying to.  Yesterday I was thinking about how my ex-husband gave up everything for the woman he now lives with.  He gave up a stable and comfortable life with his wife & children to be with her.  In certain circumstances it seems like a wonderful thing - giving up everything for true love... I just hope she was worth it.  I mean that wholeheartedly.  If he's found 'the one' then he did what was right for his heart and soul.  Of course, that doesn't excuse him from his financial and paternal responsibilities... he may still learn to balance everything properly.  And then I started thinking, as bad as its been for me, he hasn't had it so easy either.  In the past three years, he lost the best paying job he'd ever had, he was evicted and ended up moving in with the new girlfriend (perhaps only out of necessity?), was unemployed for almost a year, then lost his new job after only 3 months.  On top of that, he has been the subject of child support enforcement legal action and now has a warrant out for his arrest.  Pretty shitty year, if you ask me.  All I can wonder is, is she worth it?  And while she has stood beside him through a lot, will she stand firm through whatever else comes?    Then, there is this little, ugly satisfaction in knowing that once he left my happy little world, he lost it all.  Diva out.
an afterthought  Always be careful what you ask for, because what you want will come.  But the Universe sometimes has a very twisted sense of humor.  I was wanting a man who was interested in a commitment... what I got was a man who was already in a commitment.  Now that I think on it, all of the men I met this past year were in a relationship with someone else.  Only it took me a little while to figure it out. *sigh*  Come on 2003... and I promise to be more careful about what I ask for.  Diva out.
and it just keeps coming  While mentioning a friend's name to someone today, the co-worker in the conversation says, 'You know he got married last August, right?  Yeah, he married so-and-so who used to work with us.'  I tried to retain my composure, because I'm thinking back to when I saw him in October, and he wasn't acting like a married man.  Hmm, go figure.  So, I've put out a call to verify what I'm sure is the truth.  I figure, I'll give him the chance to come clean, since I'm not going to ever see him again anyway.  See exactly what category of creep he is... one caught up in emotional overload or one who just likes to get away with all he can.  Can't wait to see how this one turns out.  Diva out.
Oh, now its working   This morning I had wanted to write happy little thoughts about things that make me happy.  But the publishing tool for my blog wasn't working.  And now all the happy thoughts are gone.  Why, you ask?  Well, after not receiving any notice or money regarding the purge payments from my dead-beat-dad ex-husband.  I had been receiving both on a pretty regular basis up until the first week of November.  Then, nothing.  No little love notes from the state attorney's office telling me that he showed up for the court date.  No little envelopes containing the check that was keeping him out of jail.  It all stopped cold.  So, I called the State Attorney's Office for Child Support today.  First I had to hold for 20 minutes, then give the ritual information of name, social security number, current address, yadda yadda, ad naseum.  Then, I finally got to tell the nice lady that I just want to know what's going on.  She advised me that a warrant was issued for his arrest last month, when he didn't show up with the purge payment.    Of course, I have reservations about how this will affect my karma.  However, considering the guy is now unemployed and no longer contributing to the support of his children, I say let him serve his 45 days.  At this point, it makes no difference to me at all.    As long as I don't have to explain to my children why Daddy can't visit us for Christmas.  Diva out.
Just for Fred   urlLink The horoscope guy
Thanks Fred  Some people get clothes or money for their birthday.  Others get perfume and jewelry.  I got pinecones.  And I laughed and laughed...  Thanks Fred!
Monday again  Another week ahead, and according to my  urlLink horoscope guy , it has some significance. Something to do with the solar eclipse and Jupiter.    All I know is, I'm now 33 and very pleased about that.  It's funny how when I tell someone how old I am, they say I look much younger.  Like, somehow, younger is better, more attractive and thereby more valuable.  All my life I've wanted to look my age, not younger.  I've always looked forward to 40, but all of a sudden I realize... didn't Jesus and Buddha realize their true identity at 33?  I'm at a good age, and I want to make the most of every minute!  Had a great birthday, spent it with some very dear friends; had two cosmopolitans too many and at my age you'd think I would know better.  But, I made my sacrificial offering to the great porcelain god on the morning of my 33rd birthday, and I believe that I am blessed for the rest of the year.  Diva out.
My Internet Garden   I realize that I have been a little preoccupied with blogging.  What with daily entries, keeping up with all of my blogging friends, and then there's that 'NextBlog' link with promises of something new and undiscovered.  The internet has a way of creeping slowly into your daily activities, like some creeping vine.  Before you know it, all of your time is tangled up in e-mail, IM, music videos and online journals.  Well, I already stay online all day at work anyway - the system automatically logs me in.  At least my private life hasn't been invaded by the internet... I don't have a computer at home *gasp*.  But now I have a cell phone with a browser, and am considering upgrading my service -- and then I will be completely overwhelmed by IM and blogging!  Hmmm... addiction?  Is there an Internet version of AA?  Amazing the things you have to be concerned about these days.  Not watching too much tv, but spending too much time online.  Either way, you're spending all of your time staring into a brightly lit screen.  And of course, since I do this at work, there is the special consideration of trying to get work done in between my online forays.  Heaven forbid I lose my job over the internet -- how ever would I ever get online then?  So, today I'm tending to my work, trimming the entry to keep it short, and staying out of the weeds.  So much to do!  Diva out.
One man's trash...  is another man's treasure, so they say (whoever 'they' are).  I had a threesome of this yesterday, so I figured it earned a place in blog history.  First, I had a client call to ask about a local magazine that we recieve here at the hotel regularly for our guests.  It has Pamela Anderson on the cover of its 10th Anniversary Issue (January 03), and he knows someone in Kid Rock's band who can get Pamela to autograph it for him.  It was such a big deal for him that I promised to do my best and get my hands on two of them as he asked.   Turns out, all I had to do was walk down to our Housekeeping department and ASK.  We have tons of them.    So, off they went to my guest up north, and he's so very grateful and what can he do to repay me?  Well, he's a jewelry broker, so I'm sure we'll think of something.  *sparkle-sparkle*  Then, there was the request at daycare posted to the door upon entering.  Please bring in three empty film canisters and an empty tissue box.  Trash, that I would keep lying around just for such instances.  Actually, I just threw a tissue box away last Friday, and I left 3 film canisters at my mother-in-law's house over the weekend to get the film inside developed.  The children are making instruments - except for mine of course, because I threw all of that stuff away!  And then there was the binder I found tucked away on a shelf yesterday.  I use lots of binders at work -- lots of 'em.  I need a new 2 inch binder to replace an old 2 inch binder that has busted out of its 2 inches.  So, I went to remove one from a shelf that's been sitting there unnoticed for who know's how long.  I check with my office mates to make sure it's OK I take this particularly lovely 2 inch binder for my own.  All of a sudden, one of my colleagues decides that the information inside could be valuable to him, and please don't use THAT binder.  And as it turned out, he started using the info in that binder today and it has been very useful indeed.  Go figure.  Diva out.
Blogger's Back   But I have nothing clever to say today.  My head hurts, and I suspect it is due to my sinus using my left eyeball as a punching bag.  That's where the ache is concentrated, but with the help of a little extra strength something or other, I should be feeling a little better (and more medicated) soon.  As an afterthought, it seems my beneficence is at work with my current number 1.  He's being considered for a job making a ridiculous amount of money, which makes him very happy.  And, it will put him closer to me for 6 months out of the year.  The other 6 will put him in Missouri.  Um... does anyone here know where that is?  Somewhere cold, I'm sure.  Diva out.
And now, here's a perfect example of why I prefer Miami.  Thank you  urlLink Mimi Smartypants  for making this thermal annoyance so very clear to our readers.   'Also, the most unsexy striptease in the history of people taking off their clothes is the one I do huddled up next to the radiator before getting naked to shower, because first I take off the gigantoid sweatshirt that I wear while reading and drinking tea in the mornings, with the hood up and the fingerless mitten cuff things over my hands. Then there are pajama pants and wool socks to be shed, and the flannel shirt under the sweatshirt, and the t-shirt under that, and the underwear, and this whole time I have the shower going already to try and steam up the bathroom a bit. And my skin is very dry and scaly in this weather, so I wish I could have a Lotion Shower right next to the regular shower. I read somewhere that to combat dry skin in the winter you are supposed to take lukewarm showers but sorry, thank you for playing, that sounds awful.'   I generally sleep in a tank/t-shirt and light-weight cotton pajama pants.  Not exactly diva-licious, but very comfy.  And, what's a radiator?  Diva out.
A visitor's view  I am not at liberty to say from where I got these remarks.  Let's just say, hypothetically, if I was a certain diva who puts postage on all outgoing mail from, hypothetically, a hotel, I would then, hypothetically, have a chance to read postcards from guests to their friends and family back home.  Hypothetically.  Dude, Miami kind of sucks. All the girls dress like whores down here.   Even in the morning.   Even the grandmas.   Weird.  I hope that the hypothetical writer of this hypothetical postcard never reads this hypothetical blog entry.  Diva out... hypothetically. *grin*
A Diva's work is never done  I did it.  I don't know how, but I did it.  I moved from one apartment to another, from the 25th floor to the 7th, all in one weekend.  Started around 1pm on Saturday and finished by 5:30pm on Sunday.  Of course, I could never have done it without my friends and family who volunteered to help a Diva out in her time of need.  There were 8 of us in all, the guys moved the heavy furniture and the rest of us girls moved everything else gypsy style - on wheels and in bags, down the elevator to the new apartment.  No packing or unpacking, just move it from one place and put it in its new place.  Everything is in its place, even have the pictures on the walls.  And, while I had to give up the 25th floor view, I must admit that I like my new, closer to the ground view.  I hear the birds singing in the trees in the morning and yesterday I heard church bells.  It made for a very nice Sunday morning.  I have a very sunny balcony, and a great view of Downtown Miami.  And the rent is a little more than $100 cheaper.  A Diva's gotta do what a Diva's gotta do.   And now a Diva's gotta get some work done, so...  Diva out.
I love this man!  You know those days when your horoscope is just so totally on target that even you can't believe it?  Well, this is one of those days.     urlLink Astrology - Horoscopes - Jonathan Cainer's Zodiac Forecasts  Friday, 24th January 2003 SAGITTARIUS  (Nov 23 - Dec 21)   Some while ago, you asked a very good question. Ever since then, you have been on the lookout for a good answer. You have heard lots of explanations. You have contemplated many alternatives. You remain though, unsure about the best way to proceed. Now, you are remembering the reason why you asked that question in the first place. Don't feel frustrated because you don't, so far, have a satisfactory plan you can believe in. Just look, once more, at the issue you are trying to address. One more insight will soon make sense of everything.   I have been remembering the reason for the question... all night long.  My hesitation from yesterday tainted my dreams.  But I woke up this morning remembering what it is I want, and remembering that my life is determined by me - not by anyone else - man or not.  I believe I've made a good decision and am content with it.  Moving forward into my future has become my newest mantra.  I feel good today, and Jonathan Cainer has reassured me further.
37 degrees  Finally, that weather tramp is wearing a coat!  Looking very fetching in her bright green hoodie, too.  I spoke to a friend in Troy MI yesterday. It was 7 degrees.  New York reported in at 17 degrees.  Miami is at 37 degrees.  So much for that global warming theory.  Diva out.
Not feeling quite so Inspired now  Nothing like breaking the news to door number 4 about door number 3 to ruin a good mood.  And, I realize that I have issues with losing people.  So, telling him about my newest development when he had NO CLUE was very hard for me.  Shakes my faith in my own convictions; and let's face it until recently I've never been very good about sticking to my convictions.    My hands were shaking, and I felt queasy while telling him that I am now seeing someone else.    So, after I finished telling him, I called my number 3, who is currently the number 1 and only.   His voice reassured me (a little) and now my hands aren't quite so shaky.  I'm thinking lunch is out of the question though.  Diva out.
Today's Deep Thought  I probably shouldn't say 'Today's', because that would erroneously infer that there will be one every day.  'You cannot plan for your future on the basis of what has happened in the past.'   urlLink  Jonathan Cainer
Feeling a little poetic today...  Mansi shared a poem with me yesterday that I really liked.  So, today I'm feeling inspired to share a little rhyme.  It's really very old, and has very little to do with how I'm feeling today - see my current mood over there!  But, I like this one and, after all, this is my blog and I can do what I want here.  At least there is one place in the world where I can!  'Chesire Moon' The crescent moon Grins menacingly like the Chesire Cat. So now I am Alice.  With a toothy grin he bears down on  my wishful heart Sneering,  Happiness?  There is  no such thing.  Nothing but the black night and the malicious moon that cuts it.   On another note, I took my girls to a Heat game last night.  That's basketball for the sports-impaired reader.  I got three free tickets, and couldn't think of anyone better to spend my Wednesday night with. My girls had a great time screaming and blowing a horn for our team.  The littlest one had no idea what was happening and would ask me, 'Now, Mommy?'  Yes, now, baby. Scream your little head off.  Better here than at home.    We left at half time because, let's face it; two little girls get bored after an hour or so.  But it was a great time, and they each left with a Miami Heat shirt.  They just think they're the coolest girls on the planet today.  And, they're right.    Diva out.

Divine Wisdom... Someone wiser than I?  I know... I know.  It's hard to believe that anyone could be wiser than I, the Diva.  But I must insist that you go right now and read the comment on my Happy Girl entry, just below.   urlLink Mansi  reads my page, and honestly, with comments like that, I'm honored.   Thanks for your comments Mansi.  I always enjoy getting feedback from my blog, and it's nice being part of this strangely woven Web world.  Diva out.
Happy Girl  First of all, I did the Wine Club thing last night.  We hosted the US Sommelier Assocation French Wine Gala featuring over 150 wines.  Yes, 150.  We packed the room with over 200 people, and the wine flowed for 2 hours.  It was amazing.  Everyone had a great time, the wines were fabulous and all I got out the whole evening was three sips of a Veuve Cliquot Rose.  But, boy was it good.  The Dinner that followed had a bit of fiasco at seating, but in the end it worked out and everyone enjoyed themselves.  I ducked out at 10pm, leaving the revelers to finish the evening out on their own.  After trekking over to Hialeah for the girls, I finally got home about 11pm.  Needless to say, I got into the office a little later than usual today.    I did have a really nice thing happen this morning that I just had to share.  My little one went on an errand with me to the bank this morning before I dropped her off at daycare.  Outside the bank she plucked a dandelion flower, which kept her entertained on the ride to daycare.  Just before we got there, she noticed that the stem was broken, so she said it was dying.  She was very sad about this, and I explained that once you pick a flower it's going to die.    She decided that we should replant the little flower.  It became her little mission this morning to find a suitable home for her little flower outside the daycare.  She 'planted' it among some other flowers in a planter outside the daycare door.  She seemed very pleased with herself, for having saved the little flower.  I immediately felt a rush of pride and love for my littlest daughter.  Her little heart has love and compassion for even the smallest flower, and I hope that she maintains that quality as she grows.  I was also filled with hope; if this one little girl can have so much love, maybe there are more like her.  As they grow, they could create what a few of us long for now.  A peaceful, loving world filled with compassionate people.    It's a far cry from replanting a plucked dandelion... or is it?  Diva out.
Back to the Gameshow of Life  Well, my dear internet friends, my last weekend was a spinning roulette wheel of dating.  Doors were opened, and some were left closed.  I opened door number 4.  Remember how sad it was, when the player opened their door of choice only to find, not 'A new car!', but a donkey and wagon, flanked by some lovely gameshow model?  Well that was door number 4.  So, before I even stepped through it, I decided to close it back up, and move on.  Door number 3 asked to be opened, and I've taken a step inside.  It's nice there.  Warm, reassuring, encouraging.  And he sees all that my friends see in me - all the good things that make me the Diva that I am.  Yeah, he's worthy of a Diva like me.  Bob, I'll take Door Number 3, please.  Diva out.
through the wonders of technology, and a few degrees of separation, I have managed to find the link to  urlLink Weebl  again!  Hooray!  There must be tons of new cartoons to view - I lost the link months ago.  And a referral for another link that I'll check out before commenting on.  But go visit Weebl.  I think there is something there for everyone to enjoy.   Diva out.
Too cold for me!  Working on a Saturday, but I'm on my new computer and it is soooo fast, I'll be done with all of my long overdue workload so I can start Monday fresh.  And I still have time to update my blog ;)  But, as my title up there mentions, and as my little weather tramp over there indicates, it is friggin' cold today.  Doesn't that woman have a digital mink or something for days like this?    As I have said before, I live in Miami for a reason... and 52 degrees isn't it.  It's cold, it's damp, and even the sun is staying wrapped up today - hidden underneath wooly blankets of clouds.  My office has no heat, with a window taking up one corner of the room.  What I wouldn't do for an illegally hidden teapot under my desk to toast my toes right now!  May try warming my fingertips over the back of my monitor later.  Diva out.
Got my new computer... works faster than I ever imagined. But no speakers as of yet.
Grumble and Growl   Almost 2 weeks ago I called my Insurance Agent, who had always proven himself to be very knowledgeable and helpful in the world of auto insurance.  I don't sell auto insurance, so I don't know anything more than how to pay my premium.  God forbid I have to make a claim, but if so, I'd call him.  The Omniscient One, as far as I'm concerned for insurance.  I called him to ask advice on making my LAST PAYMENT for the policy.  I had received the notice of intent to cancel, and I had until Tuesday the 7th to pay.  I told him I had two options - either borrow the money from someone and pay on time, or I would wait until Thursday the 9th when I got paid.  He advised that while the policy would be cancelled, payment would be accepted and the policy would be reinstated.    So, I followed his sage advise, and paid on the 10th.  Mr. Omniscient said that paying late would be okay, and I believed him.  What a schmuck I am!  Last night I got the notice that, while the payment had been recieved, it was declined and the insurance was not reinstated.  So, I've been driving around for a week without insurance, and $200 lighter in my pocket.  I could have used that $200 for the rent.  So, I called Mr. Omniscient first thing this morning, and he's all, well, the payment was late, and now you have to buy a whole new policy.  I'm thinking he knew all along that this would happen - I'm sure he gets commission on new policies.   Of course I figure this out a little too late.  I am getting a refund in the mail, which will help to pay for a new policy, but I am NOT going to use that disceptive little creep of an insurance salesman.  I'm a little wiser, with $200 back in my pocket, and searching for another quote online.  And considering the Mercury Retrograde that I was fully warned about, I really shouldn't be at all surprised by the turn of events.    But I am and I'm pissed off.  Add to that broke, and that's me in a nutshell.  Life as a Diva isn't always what its cracked up to be.  Diva out.
Other People's Children  Other people's children are never as cute as mine. Or as well-behaved.  Yesterday, the hotel was the site of a casting call for children.  The day started with cute toddlers tagging along behind young mothers with apparently no job to prevent them from hanging around our hotel lobby all day.  I'm thinking the kids are earning the paycheck in those families.  As the day progressed, the ages progressed, so that by 5pm there was a very noisy collection of children in ages ranging from 2 upward to about 10.  By this point, the bored children and likewise bored mothers were not paying attention to each other.  Kids running around the lobby to keep themselves occupied, mothers vying for preferential treatment from the casting directors.    Noisy chattering children, running around unattended.  My own kids can get on my nerves even in their best behavior.  These were not my kids.  If they were, I would've whacked 'em but good. *grin*  Diva out.
This is an improvement?  I'm getting a new, updated computer today.  Which, of course, will take me some time to get familiar with.  Yeah, I know computers, and I love technology, but I'm working with Windows NT here.  Moving up to XP and all the idiosynchrasies that come with it.  Still, it will be faster than what I'm working on now.  As it is, I can send a document to the printer, go down two flights of stairs, put 2 quarters into the coke machine, coke drops, go back up two flights of stairs, sit at my desk, open the coke, and voila, my document begins to print.  I'm not kidding.  And they wonder why I don't get to a lot of things.  Of course, working on my blog has nothing to do with my uncompleted work load *wink*  But, the clincher is this... now that I'm getting the fabulous new toy with a larger monitor and black casing I'll be in another software training for 4 hours of every day from now till January 25th.  That gives me 4 hours to complete 8 hours of work each day on my fabulous new toy.  You just can't win around here.  Diva out.
Tuesday will be better  If I say that enough times, it will come true.  Mondays, I've realized, are probably the worst day of the week for me.  I don't think it has much to do with going back to work after having 2 days off, because I often work on a Saturday or Sunday to catch up.  I have discovered a pattern, whereby the man behind door number 4 doesn't call me on Mondays.  That may have something to do with my Mundane Mondays.  My kids get on my nerves on Mondays.  My bosses (note plural) get on my nerves.  I'm edgy, unfocused and hyper-sensitive on Mondays.  And by the time 9PM comes around, I am completely exhausted from just trying to get through the day.  But now it's Tuesday, Glorious Tuesday.  I'm focused, I'm rested, I'm ready.  Um *cough*... just one more cup of coffee.  Yeah, one more cup and I'll be ready.  And maybe a nice buttery croissant, with some strawberry jam.  And another hour of sleep.  Yeah, that's all I'll need to be ready for Tuesday.    And, of course, the possibility of a phone call from door number 4.  Diva out.

Oh the choices!  Will it be Door #1, Door #2, or Door #3?  I had three dates this weekend!  All of which came up very suddenly, without much planning.  Last night, through a splitting headache, I realized that the universe had put me on some cosmic game show.  Date number one offered all of the excitment and fantasy that I used to drown myself in.  Notice I said used to.  Date number two offered all of the intellectual stimulation and stories of world travel that make my heart beat faster and cloud my mind with vision of far-off lands.  Date number three offered sound financial security and the good things in life.  And then there's number 4.  Who somehow managed to call me before or during each of those dates.  What does door number 4 offer?  Ah, that is yet to be discovered, but he lies somewhere deep in my heart, and the promise of what's to come entices me to learn what is to be discovered.  I hate game shows.  Diva out.
So now I'm Dorothy  And apparently, my ruby red slippers are working.  See entry from 1/10/03 below if you're confused.  --I have been granted a little more time to finish paying this month's rent. --I have been offered a purportedly better apartment (with a lovely south view of Downtown Miami) for $150 less per month. --We let a salesperson go (the one with the bug up her ass), and since I did a great deal of her work now a more competent and computer literate salesperson is stepping into her shoes (not ruby red). --As a result of all of this financial maelstrom, DBD and I are on speaking terms again.  For the children, this is a good thing.  My review is soon - and I swear I'd better get at least the maximum allowable increase, or I'm gonna click my heels again and see what else I can make happen!  Diva out.

Grim Observation  Have you ever really listened to the traffic reports in the morning?  'A pedestrian was hit this morning and it had all lanes blocked for a while, but everything is cleared up now and traffic is moving normally again.'   'An accident with 2 fatalities has everything backed up.  Choose an alternate route this morning to keep your commute moving.'  Nevermind someone just DIED!

Not a happy girl  Working like crazy and making no money to show for it.

Frustrated and broke, and trying to hold my head up as I receive an onslaught of cancellation and eviction notices.  What's a diva to do?  I started taking a mental inventory this morning of all of my worldly possessions, wondering, 'What can I sell?'  Problem is I sold everything I could in the first round of this crap last year.  Just going to be more resourceful, call the DBD and tell him to solve a few of these problems for me, and figure out where to borrow a couple hundred dollars to pay the rent.  And, clicking my heels in Dorothy fashion, 'It's going to get better.  It's going to get better.'  Diva out.

Raise your hand if you're sure  I'm not sure why I'm so confident these days.  Maybe its something that comes with age.  I was thinking last night about how I'm no longer insecure about my body.  At 33, after two children, I'm in pretty good shape, 'kept my figure' as they say.  I'm not big on exercise, although I do enjoy yoga and the occasional run on the beach.  I used to be much more active.  When I was younger (and weighed less) I was so self-concious about my body - especially on those wonderful occasions when I got to be naked with someone.  I've always enjoyed the sensation of being naked next to someone else who was naked.  But, I would try to cover this little curve or that, uncertain of what unkind image it may be portraying of me.  But lately, on those now (unfortunately!) rare occasions when I get to be naked with someone, I don't even think about my body.  I don't care what image it portrays.  I guess I'm just comfortable in my own skin these days.  And let's face it, if I'm comfortable enough with a man to be naked, I'm going to be pretty sure he likes what I've got to offer anyway!   Maybe yoga has helped me to accept exactly who I am, and nevermind the body I'm encased in.  Form is my manifestation, and whatever you read in my body's shape and size has much to do with what I eat and how active I am.  But it doesn't have much to do with my soul and Self.  I have always hoped that as I grew older, I would get wiser.  If this is all I get, I'll be fine.  It's nice to finally not freak out about the skin I'm in.  Diva out.
Clean Up Time  New Year started, and I decided to clean up my blog, for starters.  Taking off 'Juan is a Loser', because I think he must have gotten over that chick in Asia since his last entry in September 02.  Added the infamous referrer list to my page; we'll just see what comes of that little gremlin.  Added a list of what I'm reading.  I borrowed the idea from Grayblog; I like his lists about him on the right side of his blog.  I also like the countdown on CandyGenius, but I'm not going to even try to figure out that script.  I'm not a scripting genius... still waiting on the results of the referrer, remember?  The blog cleanup is just the beginning.  I am planning on moving to a slightly smaller apartment, in the same building, to pay less rent.  With no child support payments on the horizon, I'm thinking smaller apartment is better than no apartment.  And I didn't really like cleaning that 2nd bathroom anyway.  New Year bringing new opportunities, new vision and a renewed energy to conquer the unconquerable.  I'm queen of the world!  Oh, was that too much enthusiasm for you?  Sorry.  Just can't help myself right now.    Diva out.
I refuse to be beaten by that damn referrer script.   urlLink refer this!
Gotta love him!  I sent this littel tidbit to my boss, telling him that instead of Adminitrative Diva, we should put this on my business cards.  factotum \fak-TOH-tuhm\ (noun)   *1 : a person having many diverse activities or responsibilities  2 : a general servant        Did you know? 'Do everything!' That's a tall order, but it is exactly what a factotum is expected to do. It's also a literal translation of the New Latin term 'factotum,' which in turn traces to the Latin words 'facere' ('to do') and 'totum' ('everything'). In the 16th century, 'factotum' was often used in English as if it was a surname, paired with first names to create personalities such as 'Johannes Factotum' (literally 'John Do-everything'). Back then, it wasn't necessarily desirable to be called a 'factotum'; the term was a synonym of 'meddler' or 'busybody.' Now the word is more often used for a handy, versatile individual responsible for many different tasks.  His reply?  'LOL.  Be careful with the spelling....'  A little devious humor never hurt anyone! *grin*  Diva out.
Couldn't have said it better myself!  Borrowed this *ahem* from another blog... the sentiment expressed is very much like my own.  All except for that thinning hair bit.  Graying, but not thinning.  Oh, and I could never, not ever, want a farm in Iceland (or anywhere else for that matter.)  Okay, disclaimer over.  Read on, dear reader!  Tuesday, December 31, 2002   Happy New Year!  I'd like to take this time to say hello, and goodbye, and wish everyone a warm year's ending. Personally, this year, the palindrome of all years: 2002, in many ways has been one of the most successful for me, and in other ways I detested waking up and wanted to hide under my bed for hours and days on end, but alas, we must move forward and embrace out journeys through life. 2002 reflects upon itself, as I looked in the mirror, staring at my reflection, an image I cannot fake to the world. My face has new changes, my hair is a lot less these days (and thinning), my eyes have grown more cynical, my voice has grown stronger, and my focus to live boldly and write truthfully and take risks seems to led me back on track... 2002 reflects itself, as I too reflected upon myself to see many things: good, bad, and ugly. We are who we are, and we're going to go where we're headed, and I wish everyone sanity, peace, joy, happiness on your trip through 2003, and I hope one of you wins the lottery this year so you can lend me $50,000 for a down payment on a farm in Iceland. With that being said, I consider myself a wealthy man, not because of my net worth, but rather the people in my life who love, listen, support and inspire me. My wealth is a result of my friendships, and because of you, I must say... Thanks.   Happy New Year.   Be Sweet!  urlLink Pauly  31 Dec 2002
People who can keep an open snack-sized bag of M&M's in their drawer for more than 3 minutes just aren't normal.  The very nice colleague who sits across the room from me (arms length really) and who has to hear me constantly chatting with myself and laughing at unspoken jokes from my computer screen, has a bag of m's in her drawer, which she takes one or two from on any given day.  One or two!  It just doesn't seem right.

Better today  Not feeling quite so overwhelmed today.  For no apparent reason, just feeling better.  Must have something to do with the planets or something.  Must see what Jonathan has to say today.  The hotel is buzzing, we're the host and headquarters for The Miami International Film Festival.  The lobby is full of people, we have events every night this week (including the Wine Club on Thursday night) and as we all know, I am happiest when I am busy.  And when the hotel is busy, I am busy.  Which is why I haven't had much time for blogging or surfing.  Work keeps interfering.  But I had a good weekend, except for sleeping in a recliner on Saturday night.  No matter what anyone ever tells you, the recliner is NOT a good alternative to a bed.  My neck is so stiff that I sometimes catch myself walking with my head hunched down because it doesn't hurt that way.  Like those old men you see waiting for a bus with his head hunched way too far forward to be comfortable, and you think for a split second, 'What's he looking for?'  But that's just the way he holds his head... and now that's almost how I hold my head too.  Stretching is helping to hold my head high again.  Some official office closed down the daycare yesterday.  They painted over the weekend and the smell was so strong that the City or somebody official, Dept of Health? came, took one whiff of the paint smell and shut them down.  2 days of no daycare.  I brought the littlest diva into the office yesterday for a few hours. Luckily it was naptime while she was here and I was able to get some work done while she slept.  Today she is with Grandma - once again thank goodness for Grandma!  The daycare should be open again tomorrow and life will be back to what I call normal.  Kala is set to go on her first overnight school-sponsored field trip.  She goes to St. Augustine in March with her class.  I told her in the beginning of the year that if she was selected to go I would find the money somehow for her to go.  She's always had issues with paying attention and being quiet in class, and behavior was taken into consideration for this trip.  Not all kids are going, but my baby is on the list!  So, I had to get the cash together.  Not easy, but that's why I worked 28 hours weekend before last.  She lived up to her part of the bargain so I kept my word.  And perhaps the reason I'm feeling so good today; I had a happy little phone call this morning returning a call from last night.  Sometimes its just nice to hear a friendly voice say, 'Have a good day!' first thing in the morning.  Because, I am.  Diva out.
Why, why, why?!  What is it about men?  Why is it that when you finally decide to step back, they want to step forward?  I have been seeing several men on a very irregular basis.  Several means 4 or 5 and the number varies because they all contact me so sporadically.  It comes in cycles, like feast or famine, you know?    Well, as I mentioned in an earlier post, Door number 3 stepped up and asked for more.  I accepted the offer, but now he's moving to Missouri and we don't speak on a regular schedule.  It was very short-lived and I need a more regular guy.  I've started pursuing another avenue, one that has remained constant and in the background and always with a promise of something truly wonderful.  Very far away and difficult to hold on to, but hope springs eternal.  My focus has shifted.  But in the meantime, while I was making number 3 my number 1,  I informed all of the scattered few that I was no longer accessible to them.  Friend yes, 'friend' No.   My love life hasn't been this busy (or confusing) in ages!  One now says he loves me (via e-card on Valentines Day -- too impersonal for me to feel it).  Another has asked to see me 3 weeks in a row.  Another that I haven't even heard from or seen in months calls me out of the blue and wants to get together.  Then there's the one that I've been letting go of for at least a year now, but he still calls and still says he loves me and 10 years from now we'll be married and living better than ever.  Nevermind the fact that I don't take half of any of this interest with a grain of salt.  But, WHY!?  As soon as you tell them no, they're all over you.  Of course I understand the mentality - can't have it so you want it even more.  But, Argh!  And some of these are truly considered friends, if only I could get the sex out of the 'friend'ship.  Working on that...  *Sigh*  I guess I shouldn't complain - its not a bad problem to have I guess.  It could be worse.  But at a time when I really want something true and constant, it makes it hard to stick to one decision.  Hmmm... decisions, decisions.  Diva out.
I'm Back  Took the day off yesterday and pretended I was a tourist.  I had family visiting from Oregon and West Palm Beach, so we all checked in to a hotel (not the one I work in).  It was fun to be on the other side of the hotel business for a while.  I took two of my cousins (in their late 20's) out on the town on a TUESDAY night.  Yes, there was actually lots to do on a Tuesday night on South Beach.  We started at a bar, then moved over to a hotel and bar owned by Chris Blackwell of Island Records (Bob Marley's manager or something).  Great place with a real smooth vibe.  We ended sitting in the lower part of the bar, slouched down on purple and red cushions with our shoes off listening to spoken word and jazz.    My cousin is convinced that one of the poets was speaking and singing directly to me - and I like her way of thinking.  He was tall, dark and oh, so smooth.  I was encouraged at the end of the evening to go and speak to him.  So I told him I was feeling him and liked what he had to say.  Word.  Great night followed by a great day by the pool with a brilliant February sun shining down on us.  85 degrees, cool breeze and not a cloud in the sky. Even floated in a hammock between two palms trees with my littlest one nestled up next to me.  Completely lost track of time.  But it did come to an end and by 6pm I was back at home with my girls, back in reality.  It was nice, and now I'm back at the office and back at my computer.  The only glowing thing in here is my monitor.  But I do have the remnants of a little sun on my face to remind me of yesterday's dream.  Diva out.
I found Me!  While checking out  urlLink Candy Genius  this morning, I followed a link to Google that she likes.  The  urlLink Elmer Fudd version .  While there, I 'googled' Downtown Diva, to see what would come up, and  urlLink I WAS THERE!   My blog was like number 3 or 4 on the list.  For me, it's like seeing your picture in the high school year book, or finding your name in the phone book for the first time.  It doesn't really take much to make me happy.  Just a simple girl with simple needs.  It somehow satisfies my deep high-school-ish need to be included.  I know I'm supposed to be unconcerned with what everyone thinks of me, but I am one of now on the list.  I am google-licious!    Diva out.
Pooped  As in exhausted, tired, wiped out.  This Administrative Diva has learned without the shadow of a doubt that I am definitely an office girl.  I racked up almost 30 hours this weekend... in two days.  I worked 30 out of 48 hours this weekend and I am BEAT!  It wasn't very strenous or physical work really.  Just getting stuff done to make sure convention attendees had a good time.  Put place cards on the banquet tables (all 2000 seats!), helped with prepping for the dinner, putting water glasses on tables as there wasn't enough hotel staff to get it all done.  Greeted attendees and handed them their registration and event packets.  Stuffed bags with gifts for nightly deliveries to all 1800 attendees.  Just stuff that needed to be done.  But 14 1/2 hours each day of it, and this Diva is not accustomed to getting up before the sun (4:30am).  It is so difficult to be gorgeous at 5:30am in a lime green uniform top.  Of course, I managed to pull it off and be the fabulous Diva that I am *wink*  But, there was lots of caffeine involved.  And today, I still need caffeine to keep my dry tired little eyes open.  Tomorrow will be better.   Tomorrow I will be visited by my favorite Aunt, her two daughters and another cousin from the West Coast.  We are going to have a girls night out and sleep in on Wednesday - no work for this Diva.  Just a little fun and sun.    Just what the doctor ordered!  Diva out.
Valentines Day  Bah - humbug!  Took my girls to an amazing belly dancing performance last night.  It was great, open theater on Lincoln Road - a 'pedestrian mall' with shops and sidewalk cafes.  The speakers were 10 feet high, blasting out Middle Eastern music.  The dancers came out by ones and twos, all glittery with their sequins and body glitter.    It really was so entrancing.  We sat there with about 300 other spectators, clapping and making the required 'la-la-la-la-la-la!' sound, equivalent to the American 'Woooooooooooooo!' or Latin 'Epaaaa!'.  We had such a great time.  And, it was such a joyful night.  Really.  Watching the beauty of the dance filled me with pure energy and joy - it's not really something I can explain or relay to anyone.  Especially through written word.  All I can say it that I'm going to have to get some belly dancing music this weekend, and there will be two little belly dancers writhing and twirling through my living room all next week.  Kala has already selected a few scarves from her dresser for the performance.  And don't be surprised when I tell you all about my first belly dancing class.    Diva out.
And My Day Continues to Improve  I may have mentioned before that I have one of the greatest bosses ever.   urlLink  Just one example of his great sense of humor.      Well, today he was the subject of a photo for a local newspaper.  He's not normally in the office until around 1pm on Thursdays, so seeing him at 8:30 threw me way off track.  He was waiting for the photographer to arrive.  So picture this:  A very professional hotel executive, grey wool suit, conservative tie and starched white shirt.  Well groomed 40-something trim and good-looking man (I love a man in a suit!).  Barefoot. *huh?*  Then, he stepped waist-deep into our 2nd swimming pool, and waded over to the middle of the pool.  I'm ready for my close up, Mr. DeMille.  Yes - in the pool with his shades on, in his suit.  It was so much fun to watch, and everyone around the pool was enjoying the view.  When the shoot was over, the view got even better.  Ladies and Gentleman, I have seen my boss in his underwear.  I may be changed for life.  And, nice package *wink*.  I hope I didn't say that out loud.  Well, Valentines Day may be a wash, but today was so much better.  Oh, yeah.  And now there's some guy named Ah-nold lounging around that same pool.  Yes, THE Arnold.  With his arm in a sling from an injury trying to do some stunt.  But for me, the true star has already left the building.  Diva out.
Another Jonathan Says  Lets get in training for Valentines day. We dont have long so we had better work hard. We will start by finding a cliff top. If we cant travel to one we had best try to make one out of papier-mache. Now we need to practise the art of running towards our partner in slow-motion with arms outstretched. Never mind WHICH partner. Thats the easy bit. The hard part is humming in such a way as to sound like a thousand soaring violins. OK. Are you ready? Steady?... Go! Ill see you tomorrow  and so I suspect will a certain someone else.  So maybe romance isn't dead, as Candygenius suggests.  Maybe someone's alarm clock went off and woke up their heart.  Hmmm.  Diva out.
Day in Diva History!  Wow!  1000 hits today!  You like me... you really like me.  *grin*  Hey, that's as close to an awards acceptance as I'll ever get.  Give me my moment of glory, for cryin' out loud!  Diva out.
Perfectly Described  Jonathan says: Some people feel that heaven is a cake shop where you can eat as much as you like without putting on weight. For others its a tropical paradise or a library full of wonderful books with all the time in the world to read them. Sagittarius heaven is not quite like this. Its a busy place full of excitement and drama. Theres trouble too - and tension. What distinguishes it from normal everyday life? Just one thing. In this other world, your every move works well, your every decision proves wise, your luck ensures that you take it all in your stride.  Yep.  I always say I'm happiest when I am busy.  Gotta have a problem to fix in order to be happy, even if the problem was created by me just so I would have something to fix. *sigh* It's quite an ugly cycle.  Oh, and I'm reading Moliere this week.  Don Juan, The Would-be Gentleman, and The Misanthrope (Miser).  The characters are so overly exaggerated as to be comic, but there's a deep truth in much of it.  It's just beginning to settle in to my understanding, and I feel more and more regret for not attending college.  I would have read most of these years ago had I been a student.    I'm still growing up, and only now beginning to realize some things that others figured out a long long time ago.  Then again, I always did enjoy being the naive little fool that I am when it comes to life.  But, I'm figuring out that there are certain rules that everyone follows.  Rules stink.  Diva out.
Got on my walkin' shoes   Feel like a little virtual travel?  Check out  urlLink Taiwan .    Just got an e-mail from a friend while she was checking her e-mail at the airport in Hong Kong.  Returning home from her trip to South Asia.  For me, knowing that message traveled from Hong Kong to me was like getting a post card.  I'm adding it to my collection.  And, I was sent a pic from another friend from his travels to Helsinki.  There's this medieval-looking castle-like church or something behind him, and he's all wrapped up in a heavy coat with a scarf covering his face up to the ears.  Snow all around.  Looks cold.  He's so lucky to have been there.  One day I'll send everyone a picture of me in front of that place.  Diva out.

Not Munday Anymore  I was reminded yesterday that I really don't like Mondays.  They have some horribly oppressive effect on me, and they make my heart sad.  Literally.  And then, of course we have the impending horrors of Valentines Day, and I was again reminded that I really really don't like Valentines Day.  There are so many reasons for it, and the Top 10 below are just the beginning.  I was thinking last night about the pressure of the holiday, and how hopes are never quite fulfilled and dreams never fully realized.    Nevermind that whatever romantic bones I had in my body are now all broken.  My rose colored glasses have faded to black.  Does that happen with age, or is it just because of how I've absorbed my own personal experiences?  Is romance dead - or have I killed it in my own heart?  I have a whole week to contemplate this question.  Culminating in a day of paper hearts and chocolates.  Thank goodness I had the foresight to get myself scheduled to a weekend of working - 20 hours this weekend to keep me busy and my mind occupied.  The busier I am the happier I am.  Diva out.

urlLink Top 10 Worst Ways to spend Valentines Day   10.  Dressed in a red dress with white stockings, and dangly red heart earrings.  Hmm... red shoes or white?   9.  Pretending all day long that you actually LIKE Valentines Day, and wishing all a 'Happy' one with a grin plastered on your face. 8.  Fretting over which of the 15 valentines YOU sent goodies and cards to will actually respond in kind. 7.  Telling your mother in law what a wonderful son she has, and Yes, I'm sure that although he has deserted you both and run off to Zimbabwe with a toothless hot dog vendor, that it has not diminished in the least his outstanding character.   6.  Commiserating with ANYONE about her biological clock. 5.  Receiving unwanted Valentines from desperate coworkers who are just dying to get laid - and they think you are just as desperate! 4.  Sending unwanted Valentines to coworkers because you are just dying to get laid! 3.  Any and all contact with old lovers, flirting with the wishful thinking that NOW they're not losers and could actually be worth your time. 2.  Watching every romantic comedy from Moonstruck to One Fine Day, Sliding Doors to Serendipity alone with the biggest tub of buttered popcorn you can find and wondering why you can't have that perfect little romance - or that perfect little belly button. 1.  Getting toasted alone in a singles bar looking for a new Valentine.  Results in a glowing neon sign over your head that says 'I'm Easy, Big Boy! Come and get me.'    Diva out.
Munday  *sigh*  I was inspired on Friday to write a lengthy essay on why I want to be 5 years old again.  But the responsibilities of my grown up self deterred me.  I wanted to expound on the freedom and joy of being 5, but the drudgery of single parenthood prevented me.    I want my mommy!  But then, there was the excursion to  urlLink Madame's  gain. As entertaining as ever - but there's something disturbing about envying a man for his feminine qualities, and wishing you had his taste in dresses and heels!  *sigh again*  Peeing in the bathroom with a man in the next stall was an interesting twist to the already twisted evening.  The men's room was broken, so it became a co-ed potty.  But, I've been to New York, so I was fine with it.  Remember Ally McBeal?  And, it's always great to inform someone new that I have a 10 year old and an almost 4 year old.  'Wow - you don't look old enough to have a 10 year old!'  Thank you, thank you very much.  Diva out.
Happy Friday Everybody!  My newest online addition - since I now have SPEAKERS! - is listening to streaming radio from all over the world.  I've listened to New York, Seattle and Copenhagen. Today I'm 'in' Manila.    As for my postcard collection, I received one from Australia yesterday and a friend in NY just promised to send one from  Taiwan - from his trip last December.  The idea is to create a travel itinerary for future reference - I want to go to all of the places that I have postcards from.  But for now, I travel vicariously through my friends and my online radio.  Hope this isn't as far as I ever get!  I must have been a Viking or gypsy in a past life.  I NEED TO ROAM!

Eureeka!  Apparently sleep deprivation is good for something.  After finally falling asleep around midnight, last night/this morning somewhere between 4am (after my little one woke me up to get her a little warm milk to go back to sleep) and 5:30am (when I gave up trying to go back to sleep and sat up to read) I figured that I should be able to create links to blog entries.  And, what do you know, I was right.  Of course that was just one of a million and one items running through my 'monkey mind' before the sun came up.  Fred - that's a Buddhist term, and while I'm not a Buddhist, it perfectly describes how my mind was travelling from one thought to another. *smirk*  Now I can go back and edit that Columbia entry, and instead of a lengthy entry of plagiarism, I can lead you to the blogs directly.  But now, I think I go for my second cup of coffee.  I think its going to be a looooong and caffeinated day.  Diva out.

Yay for Me!  Every once in a while, you should be allowed to toot your own horn.  And if not on your own blog, then where?  So,    ---   (that's me tooting my own horn)       (Paraphrased just the good stuff from Today's NEW YORK TIMES, Business Day, 2/4/03)        ' Where a Working Trip Can Seem Like Pleasure for Those in Winter's Grip                          By MARCI ALBOHER NUSBAUM        HOTELS        With refurbished Art Deco gems sprouting like mushrooms in South Beach, arguably the most chic stretch of beach in the country, deciding which one to book isn't easy. Monique Skruzny,  [WINE CLUB MEMBER AND NEW BEST FRIEND]   senior vice president for investor relations at AOL Latin America, says the  NATIONAL  (800-550-0505, from $189) is a standout.       'While the SHORE CLUB or DELANO may win points for hipness, I prefer the home-away-from-home feel of the National, where I know I'm going to see the same faces at the front desk each time I visit,' she said. Special touches abound, like free homemade strawberry-flavored lemonade at check-in, free Internet service in the lobby cafe and $9-to-$12 meals for the return flight home. Ms. Skruzny also recommends  THE WINE CLUB . 'For $20 you can mingle with an international beach set of upscale professionals,' she said.'   Monique is a friend of the woman who wrote the article, and was contacted to discuss business travel in Miami.  As a Wine Club member, she extolled on the wonders of The National Hotel, where I work, and The Wine Club, which I run.  In fact, The Wine Club is what introduced her to our hotel.    Go Diva!

Blog Update  on the Diva Books... no disrespect to the Dalai Lama, but his book is boring.  It reads like an old man rambling.  I was very dissapointed.  I loved the Coehlo book, The Pilgrimage.  I have to read more of his work, it touches on the magic that moves around and through each of us every day.  Very inspiring.  Now, I'm reading Whence the Goddesses, A source book.  This thing is fascinating.  Its more like a text book on Indo-European history and mythology, and it touches on some of the information I already knew on a few classic goddesses, like Athena and Aphrodite.  But it offers so much more details on all of the major goddesses that were worshipped throughout history, up to today.  I'm really enjoying reading it.  I have also picked up a collection of plays by Moliere.  I wanted to read Tartuffe, but the Main Library downtown never has any of the books I'm looking for.  So, I have Don Juan and a few other plays.  I'm looking forward to reading it after the Goddesses.  Now, I have tons of work to do.  My boss took yesterday off, since it was his birthday.  He wanted to avoid any birthday surprises and tom-foolery that our staff may have had planned for him.  Such a party-pooper.  And how dare he deny me birthday cake!    Diva out.
Tribute to our newest heroes  Nevermind the fact that they were already heroes before Friday's tragedy.  One radio station here in Miami decided to play music without DJ's, because 'they had a hard time having fun' in the face of the tragedy, and asked that the listeners join them in 'saying a prayer TO our new heroes'.  Not for our heroes, but to them.  Now, they're gods or patron saints I suppose.  Well, they were in the heavens when it happened.    I can't really express what I felt when I actually heard of the tragedy finally on Sunday afternoon -- I avoid media as much as possible.  And, believe it or not, the whole mail truck hi-jack hi-jinx took precedence on the whole 6 minutes that I did watch of Friday night's news.  I am saddened, but am not able to express how.  I've found some very touching remarks that say more than I ever could.   urlLink Astronomy picture of the day    urlLink  Life on the Ridge - 7 candles lit    Earlier in the week Brian posted about the Challenger Explosion. What are the odds that another shuttle, the Columbia, would be lost just a few days after that anniversary? And within a week of the anniversary of the Apollo disaster?  Kari and I were placing our order for Rick's breakfast sandwich when we heard the announcement over the radio. I couldn't speak. Kari had to climb over to my side and order. She doesn't quite grasp what the big deal is.  How do I explain to her that this has affected me many times more than the events of September 11th?  NASA's space program represents possibilities to me. The loss of the Columbia is a loss of possibilities. What discoveries were closer to being made by the experiments conducted on the shuttles? What worlds would become open to us because of the space program?  We can't dwell on what ifs, but we can feel pain at the loss of what could have been.     urlLink Surreal    urlLink  Saturday, February 01, 2003  - this is truly a sad day.      urlLink  Surreal    urlLink  Rest in peace    I am sad too.

Winter in Miami as it should be!  Yesterday I took a walk in paradise.  No, really, that's what the city of Bal Harbour hails itself as, 'Florida's Paradise'.  There's this wonderful path that runs along the ocean, meandering through palm and sea grape trees.  It's gorgeous.  Let me transport you there... I would suggest you close your eyes for this exercise, but then you wouldn't be able to read on.  So, don't.  Pathway of crushed seashells crunches under your feet.  Palm trees stand lazily along the edge of the path, with arms raised to the brilliant blue sky, giggling with the occasional breeze.  Butterflies flutter by and sea birds float overhead.  Ocean waves roll onto the shore, reminding everyone to be respectfully quiet with their shhhhshing.  The warm sun shines down and the breeze makes sure you don't get too warm.  And still the pathway quietly announces your every step.  This is Winter in Miami!    Diva out.
And later that day...  I received a call today from the father of my children.  I've decided not to call him 'my ex' since I really don't want any connection to him.  Although, 'my child-support check' would be a nice connection, but that isn't happening any time soon.  So, in all of his unemployed glory, he called today to tell me he wants to take the girls to opening day at The Marlins - that's baseball for the sports-impaired reader.  He's a big baseball fan, and always makes a point to take the girls to a game or two during season.  So, it's opening day and he's going to pick up the girls.  'Okay,' I say.  At least he's doing  something  with them, and that's a good thing.  Funny thing is, when he goes to pick up the oldest diva-ette, she doesn't want to go!  She'd rather stay at the Youth Center with her friends, swimming in the pool.  Ha!  So the littlest diva-ette (who really has no say in the matter) goes off with daddy to see The Marlins.  Maybe my oldest daughter is beginning to grow up a little, and daddy isn't quite so perfect?  Or maybe she just prefers the pool to baseball with daddy.  I must admit I found a great deal of satisfaction in this little turn of events, no matter what the cause.  Petty perhaps, but I got a good little snicker out of it nonetheless.  As I've said before, I'm a simple girl with simple needs.  It doesn't take much to make me happy. *grin*  Diva out.
Ah, Monday  And I'm feeling pretty good.  No explanation for it other than my cold is finally breaking up.  I did a 4-mile walk yesterday along the beach - before the weather turned ugly.   It's so strange, I have a sunburn from yesterday morning, and today, after the terrible storm that tore through here, its 55 degrees.  Last week it was 85, today 55.  Go figure.    I had some friends over on Saturday night to help me polish off a bottle of Cabernet-Merlot.  I made chicken quesadillas that turned out really well - and with guacamole & sour cream... divine!   We had a very laid-back evening and played a little scrabble.  Would you believe they wouldn't let me use 'joie' as a word!  'What's that?,' they said.  'Its French for joy,' I said.  'You can't use French words.  How do you even know how to spell that?!'  After accidently insulting my friend, 'Because I have a brain and know how to spell!' (oops) I explained that what I meant to say was that I use the word often - as in 'joie de vivre' - it's used in English and I read French literature.  They didn't buy it -- the Philistines!  But I still won the game.  *smirk*  And now I'm back at the office and ready to get to work  sort of .    Diva out.
'Your attention please!'  At 4:10AM, that's what woke me up.  A recording of a man's voice, requesting my attention. 'There has been an emergency reported in the building.  Please take the stairs to your designated exit or to the main lobby.  Do not take the elevators.'  This is exactly what one wants to hear at 4:10 in the morning.  Yep, I'm racing down those stairs in the middle of the night in my jammies just like the man says.  Right.  What I did do is notice that my littlest diva didn't even notice the alarm.  Slept right through it.  I went out onto my balcony to review the situation.  Cool and quiet night, light rain with a chilly breeze.  No firetrucks anywhere around.  No smoke or evidence of chaos.  Of course, the thought did occur that we could be experiencing some sort of bizzare terrorist attack... but that pathetic paranoia faded quickly.  I live in downtown Miami, in a predominantly black neighborhood (yes, the diva lives in 'the hood').  Unless there was some poorly misguided attack, I figured it wasn't really likely.  But the damn thing kept going and going.  I remember seeing an apartment building on fire when I was very little, and the sights and smells of all of that came back to me last night.  I started wondering if I should take flight; pick up sleeping beauty and go down to the lobby to see what's what.  I started wondering what I should preserve should a fireman come knocking on my door.  Where's my purse?  Should I take my tax receipts?  Was there anything besides my daughter and my cosmetics that I couldn't live without?  Then after about 15 minutes the man's voice halted... and I was relieved.  Then it started again.  This stop and start tease went on for another 5 or 10 minutes.  Finally at 4:45am all was quiet and I crawled back into my bed; next to my sleeping diva-ette.  Oh the joys of living in a high-rise.      But as I drifted back to sleep, I did say a little prayer of thanks that it was only a false alarm, and that we were safe and warm in bed.  Sometimes it's good to be reminded of just how lucky you are.    Diva out.
I finally have something to say about the war   March 26, 2003  Our Correspondent in Iraq  Christopher Allbritton, former AP and New York Daily News reporter, is about to become the Internet's first war correspondent. Allbritton has been collecting donations on his blog, Back To Iraq so that he can travel to Iraqi Kurdistan to report on Gulf War Redux and the occupation to follow. In about six months he has raised $10,318.21 and received donations of equipment from the likes of Panasonic and Iridium.  Chris is responsible to nobody but his readers. He will be filing stories from Iraq through e-mail. His articles will be delivered to 'angel investors'  those who donated to his endeavour  first, and then posted to  urlLink Back To Iraq  for the masses to read. Chris' travels in Iraq will be directed by his readers. Those who have donated will be able to e-mail him and ask him to check out specific things. As long as it's reasonable, Chris will be happy to oblige.  Chris truly is the Internet's first very own correspondent. He isn't hemmed in by a news organization. He isn't beholden to advertisers. He isn't unduly influenced or handcuffed by the embedding process. He will be out there reporting for us, and responsible to no one but us. This is truly a significant moment in the development of the Internet and of 'new media' journalism.   I urge you to check out Back To Iraq and, if you can, donate. Chris leaves for Istanbul tonight.   urlLink Posted by George Paine  From the 'Gulf War Redux' Department as of 09:15 AM  Diva out.
What are they thinking?  There are 2 new advertising campaigns out right now that, if nothing else, have at least caught my attention.    First of all, there's the new Guess? girl.  At least I think she's new.  I see her every morning on my way to work, on a bus stop ad.  Have you seen this?  She sort of looks like Claudia Schiffer, very Bridgette Bardot-ish; only she's more like the white-trash trailer park version.  I'm not sure what's going on with this one - maybe it's Claudia all washed out and used up?  Is she hard pressed for money or something?  I don't understand.  Maybe Guess? is trying to reach the low income denim wearers of America?  Then there's the new 'Pork, the other white meat' campaign.  Which, now that I see these two together, sort of goes with the trailer park girl. But, I digress.  Familiar quotes and phrases have been twisted to serve pork's purpose.  There's 'Go ahead, make my pork' and 'Time flies when you're having pork'.  It's clever I suppose.  Not really very creative, but catchy.    There's only one problem for me with this.  I have a friend with a very colorful vocabulary and he already uses pork as a replacement for another very colorful word.  You, uh, change the p-o-r to f-u-c and, well... you get the picture.  So, when I read 'Time flies when you're having pork' I'm thinking, 'Yeah. It sure does.  And I could use a little pork right now!' *blush*  Diva out.
Just a thought  Just because I don't say anything doesn't mean I don't have anything to say.  Grasshopper, oh, um... I mean, Diva out.
Quote for today  'Religions are different roads converging on the same point. What does it matter that we take different roads so long as we reach the same goal? I believe that all religions of the world are true more or less.

Monday, bah humbug!  If you were to take a look at the past entries for Mondays, you'll see that I am just not a Monday person.  And here we are again.  I had high hopes for another fabulous fun-filled weekend, but all I got was a weekend of being sick and hiding under covers on the sofa.    It started off well enough, with a trip to the salon on Friday afternoon.  Nothing better than an aromatherapy scalp massage and a hairwashing.  Ahh!  Walked out of there feeling all diva-licious, but by the time I got to my office, the humidity had wreaked havoc on my new 'do.  *sigh*  Friday night was lots of fun, with more alcohol than a Diva should consume in one night.  Didn't get out of the bar until 3:30... in the morning.  Sure, that's no big deal for you maybe, but for me... that's practically marathon partying.  I got to play pool, and danced a little and had a genuinely good time.  But I payed for it on Saturday.    That's when the cold that had been threatening to take over finally won.  In my weakened -- or is it weekend *grin* -- condition, the cold conquered all.  I sat motionless on my friend's sofa during a playdate with the little divas, then got into bed around 9pm on Saturday night.  Slept till 2:30pm on Sunday, moved to the sofa, and moved in and out of conciousness the whole day.  Missed my friend's wedding, too.   And today I would really prefer to be back on my sofa, under a blanket.  But, dedicated Diva that I am, I am at work.  I don't know for how long though.  Diva out.
urlLink Happy Friday!   These questions are sort of thought-provoking.  Almost too much work on a Friday morning!  1. If you had the chance to meet someone you've never met, from the past or present, who would it be? I would like to say Albert Einstein, but I don't think we'd have much to talk about - everything he'd say would probably go right over my head.  Maybe Van Gogh would be good to talk to, or Marilyn Monroe.  I bet she'd be cool to hang out with and chat over a martini or two.  2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?  Hmmm... seems to me the more things change the more they stay the same.  I guess the turn of the 20th Century was an exciting time.  Roaring 20's, industrial revolution and all that jazz.  Yep, early 1900's please.  3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?  I really love Miami, but if I had to move I would make sure it was someplace whiere it is always warm, never snows and is near the ocean.  Aruba maybe?  4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?   If I had to be... wait, I already am a fictional character!    Ok, when I'm not the Diva, I'd be Cyrano de Bergerac  5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be? I already look like everyone else.  I always get, 'Aren't you so-and-so's sister?' or, 'Didn't you used to work at blah blah incorporated?' and 'Wow, you look just like what's-her-face famous-lady'.  So, apparently I'm already wearing someone else's face.  Have a fabulous Friday everyone.  And in true Diva fashion, I am planning a big, fun-filled weekend again.  Meeting friends for 3-1 drinks tonight.  Yes, you read that right.  Three for One.  They don't call it Happy Hour for nothin'.   Saturday I will spend quality time with my little Diva-ettes and Sunday I'm attending a very informal wedding at the home of a friend.    Happy Friday!  Diva out.
More blogging fun  This site tells you how many people in the UK have your name.   urlLink You're not me .

Squeaky Clean  Going to the dentist is kind of like going to confession.  'Forgive me, Doctor.  It's been 6 months since my last cleaning.  Since then I have eaten candy, chewed gum and neglected to floss on a regular basis.'  Then, he looks at you with that condescending my-teeth-are-better-than-yours Dentist glare, and says, 'OK, let's take a look.'    You leave after he gives instruction on how to redeem yourself for the next visit.  'Brush and floss every day.  Don't forget.  See you in 6 months.'  My teeth are squeaky clean now, except that I had lunch just AFTER the cleaning.  Ah, forgive me.  Diva out.
Happy Monday is an oxymoron  I'm here, and that's about as much as I can do today.    I did have a great weekend, even better than I expected.  Saturday I went to a Renaissance Fair with a friend.  She was feeling very generous, and insisted I pick out something.  I left with an Irish Cladaugh (spelling?) ring, which I have always wanted.  It was really very nice, and I'll have to go to more of those kinds of events.  Best of all, my friend had free tickets.  I love free.  Saturday night I went out with friends to the opening of a restaurant / lounge.  Very cool place, very chic with all of the 'right' people.  The entire area was an open courtyard, with a huge tiki hut in the middle, serving as the main restaurant & bar.  Several little tikis covered booths along one side of the place, making for very intimate table settings.  Great music and free drinks with the night sky and full moon overhead.  I sipped champagne and danced my ass off and didn't get home until almost 3am.    Sunday I went to a movie with another friend, an advance screening of the new Chris Rock movie 'Head of State'.  Pretty funny with very subtle political satire blended in.  Chris Rock was there for Q&A afterwards.  My friend was in a great mood, the movie was good and Chris was funny.  It was a very entertaining evening.  And, in all, I spent about $3 the whole weekend.  I had to tip the bartender on Saturday night for all the free drinks.  This is how all of my weekends should be!  Fun-filled and free.  Did I mention all of this stuff was free?  I love free.  Diva out.
Waxing Philosophical  And probably over-analyzing everything again.  However, the thought occurred to me that I don't exactly have the life I would have chosen if I could have chosen one.  Single mom, 2 kids, struggling to make ends meet and to make sense of this life experience.  If I wasn't such a coward, maybe I would just end this tour around the sun and start all over again.  But with my luck I'd come back as a beetle or a cockroach and be crushed in the first few days of my new existence.  Just desserts I'm sure.  But then, I realized that this IS the life I've chosen.  Each decision I've made in my life, no matter how wise or unwise, has formed this existence.  Deciding to have my first child at 23, instead of not having her, put me on this current path.  And sometimes the most inconsequential of acts can have the strongest effect on one's life.  Whether I decided for myself or allowed 'fate' to decide for me, I still chose each step along the way.  I am who I have made myself to be.  So I truly am living the life I have chosen - like it or not.  As I get older, I am trying to pay more attention, to become more mindful of my decisions.  And, in all, I really do like who I am and what my life is.  While it could use a little upgrading in some respects (who couldn't do with a little improvement here and there), I really believe I am the best Diva that I can be.  Onward and upward with a mindful step.  And I won't be coming back as a cockroach!  Maybe a pampered French poodle?  Diva out.
Happy Friday!    urlLink Friday Five  1. Do you like talking on the phone? Why or why not? Yes.  I especially enjoy talking to my children on the phone when they're away at their grandma's house.  2. Who is the last person you talked to on the phone? My youngest daughter, who was sick and stayed at grandma's house yesterday.  3. About how many telephones do you have at home? 1 phone - only my cell.  4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened? 2 encounters.  1 was me, being rude and hanging up on someone.  I told her I had to go, had another line to answer, but she kept wanting to know when I was going to pay some bill.  I tried to be polite and end the conversation, but finally I just had to hang up her.  The other is a man who calls occasionally to speak to my boss at the office.  He asks for him, and before I can even answer that he's out of the office and can I assist him the guy hangs up!  So rude.  5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?  Depends on the person.  I haev a few friends that I don't really want to talk to, as they draw out the conversation and babble on when I have no time.  So an e-mail is quicker.  Other friends I like to babble on with, so its ok to talk.   Sometimes it just depends on what time of day it is.  Looking forward to a fabulous weekend.  Have lots of plans, as a Diva should *wink* - taking my girls to a birthday party at a friend's house, which should be lots of fun - meeting a friend for drinks early evening on Saturday then meeting with even more friends for the opening of a restaurant & lounge with free drinks and great music.  The plan: to Eat, drink and be merry! - on Sunday I have a movie pass for a new movie that will be released soon.  Hope to take a friend.  So, I may have lots to tell you about on Monday, dear reader.  Stay tuned, and have a great weekend yourself!  Diva out.
I wonder where my little weather tramp shops... she has a great wardrobe.  Mine needs work.  Black and gray dominate my closet, sprinked with white shirts and the occasional blue.  With all the tropical splendor surrounding me you'd think I could find more inspiration.  Pinks and blues, reds and yellows.  Nope.  Just straight-laced and conservative black and white.    Just your dazzling diva.  Must... shop... soon!  Diva out.
Blah Tuesday  Finished reading Madame Bovary last night.  I think it must have been designed to warn young girls of living a frivolous life.  Young woman falls in love, marries.  Then realizes she's not really in love.  Miserable existence, falls in love with another young man.  Resists temptation, continues miserable existence.  Another man meets her, decides he will have her.  And he does.  They have an elicit affair, and she is blissfull for 2 years.  He leaves her, and she almost dies of grief.  Runs into the first young man, falls into an affair with him.  Husband knows nothing about it.   And all the while, she gets herself & husband so far in debt that the officials come to sell her stuff.   In her final moment of desperation, she asks her current lover for help in getting money, he can't.  She goes to her first lover for help, he won't.  Instead of repenting, telling her husband the truth and seeing the error of her ways, she decides to eat arsenic and kill herself.  Husband dies of grief at losing her, their little daughter is left penniless and orphaned.    Nice bedtime story, huh?  No wonder I'm feeling low today.    Diva out.
Odds and Ends   I'm in a funk today, and feel like I'm not getting anywhere or getting anything done.  Maybe I'm just tired.  Reading 'Madame Bovary', and its really depressing me.  Had 2 strange dreams last night and didn't sleep well in between dreams.    The best part of my weekend was my daughter's 10th birthday.  Nevermind the fact that I'm not old enough to have a 10 year old daughter, and I don't know how she grew so fast.  Anyway, she invited 8 of her little girl friends over - all 9 and 10 years old.  The usual sleepover party: pizza, junk food, ice cream and soda.  The sugar kicked in around 11pm and around 4:30AM I had to remind them to be quiet, since neighbors above and below were probably trying to sleep.  I did manage to sleep a little... I woke up around 6:30am and all was quiet.  They had finally run out of steam.  We had eggs, bacon, waffles and toast for breakfast at 9:30am.  Hit the pool by 10:30am.  By 2:30pm I was wondering when their mothers were going to get there to pick them up!  I think I aged 2 years this weekend, which makes me just about old enough for a 10 year old daughter.  It was fun, but  I won't be doing that again soon.  Diva out.

There's just no talking to some people   I am not what you would call a religious person.  I tend to keep out of Christian conversations, since I prefer to accept and respect all religions and beliefs.  Whatever works for you, you know?  Well, me and my big mouth.  I recieved this:  (This was a forward worth passing along!)          There is a chance our country may be going to war very soon.  My son and I were talking about numbers the other night.  In scripture, the number 3 represents the Holy Trinity.  I thought of calling for a day of prayer for our country.  When you may ask?  March 3, 2003. It would be 03-03-03.     Wouldn't it be great if all the Christians in the world or at least in our country would stop what they are doing and pray on the same day. We could make 03-03-03 God's Day.  Faith is the doorway that all miracles come through, but prayer is the key that unlocks the door.      What about all stopping activity together at 03:03 in the afternoon?  Then it would be 03-03-03-03-03.  And that won't happen again for another thousand years (in 3003).     I'm marking my calendar for 03-03.   If each of you pass this on to your friends and family, and they in turn to theirs, we could have a powerful prayer time on that date.  Please do your part..   And after some thought, responded like this: Dear All,     I was forwarded this message by one who you forwarded it to.  However well meaning the thought behind the message, I would like to make a suggestion.  Imagine how much more powerful this prayer would be if instead of asking only for Christians to pray, but for all people of all religions to pray.  Belief in prayer makes the difference, no matter whether you are praying to God, El, Buddha, Jehova, Krishna or Mohammed.  Accepting the power of prayer should be more about accepting the power of those who pray, with love and acceptance.  Just a thought to consider on 03/03/03  a world of prayers instead of a Christian sect of prayers could make that much greater a difference.  A few days later, I got THIS:   Excuse me, I am not trying to be rude, but the things that you just said, however 'well meant' are a complete and total lie, and I do not appreciate you forwarding your reply to the people on my list. You said that the power of prayer is 'the power of those that pray' ????!!! O.K. I guess that the murderer that prays to Mohammed, or Allah, Or anyone else, that by the way is dead, buried, and DID NOT rise again, it's o.k. because they are sincere. O.K. and they will be just as sincere when they bomb our country with a nuke right??? You need to think next time before you type. There is only one true God and His name is in the BIBLE. He is the only one that will hear any prayers, and THAT is the truth. I will be praying for your salvation, so that you may spend eternity in Heaven with God. Please feel free to write back. I do not speak these things out of meanness. I truly want you to know the truth. And what you said is as far from the truth as you can get. No one's prayers will be heard if sent to the wrong 'person' Just like if you send a package with no address it will be lost.    It never ceases to amaze me how incensed a 'Christian' becomes when you suggest there may be other valid beliefs out there. *sigh*    Is there no hope for peace?  I respect the zeal behind the response, but ::Murderer praying to Mohhamed:: ??  Please, dear readers, give me some sign of hope here.  What's you're point of view on this?  I would enjoy hearing back on this.  By the way, my response to her:  Well,  it is always good to hear other points of view.  Thank you for sharing yours with me.   Peace-n-Love Diva out.
Random Observation  Answered a call this morning, someone looking for someone else.  She was calling from a trade show and needed info on one of the attendees, who happens to work with me.  The acronym for the show is ITME.  Read aloud, you would probably say 'it-me'.  But, here in Miami we don't call an I an 'eye', we call it an 'eee'.  So, what she said was, 'I'm calling from eatme'.  Excuse mi?  Diva out.
First things first  Let me just say right of the bat, the MSN Home Page features an article 'Do You Waste Time at Work?', byline: Take our quiz and find out.  Ummm, I could be wrong, but if you're taking the quiz at work, you may be wasting time!  Diva out.
Grrrrrrrr!  Ok.  The desire to hurt something has come back.  I have been desperately searching for one tiny, inconsequential little piece of paper that I knew I had handed off to someone at least 4 weeks ago.  He, in turn, handed it over to someone else for further processing.  Last week, I was asked about the status of that unimportant little piece of paper - since it was responsible for paying for the entire 4 day stay for a guest travelling from Europe, containing her credit card number, authorization for charges and approval from her bank!    NO ONE COULD FIND THE DAMN THING!  I asked again, please check again and again.  I really don't want to contact this guest and say, 'Oh. Sorry. Yeah, we lost that.  Hope you don't start finding weird charges on your card.  If you do, we had nothing to do with it!'  So, I asked one more time.  And I asked someone else this time, because I wanted to look myself.  Before I had the chance to look myself, this wonderful person informs me that he found the authorization right where it was supposed to be.    SO WHY DIDN'T THE ONE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT DAMNED LITTLE SLIP OF PAPER KNOW WHERE IT WAS?  A week of fretting and worrying over nothing.   No wonder my eye is ticking along at a regular clip today.  Grrrrrrrrr!  Diva out.
To Explain my I-Mood  I am not a violent person.  In fact the only person I've ever hit out of anger was my ex-husband, 2 days before I married him.  Should have taken that as a warning.  Anyway, this morning my eye is twitching (a newly developed stress-related twitch) and I am completely on edge.  The thought occurred to me this morning on the way to work that I understand how parents can beat their children.  Not that I condone it or would ever hit my children, but out of sheer exasperation and frustration, I see how it happens.    I wanted to tear wings off flies or kick a dog or something.  Wanted to yell at my children to hurry up and blast my car horn at every driver in my way while I sped down the highway at 70mph this morning.  Some horrible seed of anger has sprouted in me this morning and I don't know why.  And I don't feel sad or anxious.  Actually I feel pretty good today.  And now that I'm at work, I'm calmer.  The room is quiet, my coffee is good and the oatmeal is hot.  It seems to have passed, for now...  Diva out.

Happy Monday  Having a great day.  Not sure why, but not going to question it.  Had a good weekend, saw the movie 'Chicago'.  As your very own Diva, I highly recommend it.  I want to go again and then buy it when it comes out on video/dvd just to see Queen Latifah's singing part again.  Oh, and that Murderess Row Tango (or something like that) 'He had it comin'' has been running through my head ever since!  Had a drink with some friends Saturday night, then went running on the beach yesterday and got a little sunburned.  Nothing like falling asleep on the sand to totally relax you.  And, instead of a happy voice first thing in the morning, there was a phone call late last night.  Same friendly voice, this time to wish me a good night.  It was.  Diva out.

Grrr.... grumble, grumble  Consider that your warning... and let the grumbling begin.  Last night some cretin, or more likely cretins, decided it would be lots of fun to throw empty beer bottles off the balcony.  From waaaaaaay up high.  At about 5:30 in the morning.  I didn't even know what the horrible glass-shattering was.  From under my pillow, it sounded like someone was bowling with beer bottles and getting strikes regularly.   I did finally get back to sleep for a little while, with an occassional score here and there interrupting my zzzz's.  When I got out of bed this morning, I went out onto my own terrace to see if I could find any trace of what exactly had happened.  I discovered on the rooftop two or three floors below me that someone had discarded three empty cases of beer.  So, what, that's like 36 beers?  And strewn across one section of the roof, probably directly below where ever they flew down from, were lots and lots of empty beer bottles.  Some were still entact, some were completely shattered.    Who, on a Tuesday night, can consume 36 beers?  And, why would anyone think it would be fun to toss them over the balcony at 5:30am?  Apparently, someone without work on Wednesday and without any consideration or common sense.    *Grrrrrr!  Diva out.

Da-da-da!  Su-per Mom!  Regular readers may remember that I live in a high-rise.  30 floors of luxurious diva livin' high in the sky.  And with that luxurious living comes the elevator and all that comes with it.  I've never been too comfortable in these metallic sardine cans, but am always grateful for not having to climb 30 flights of stairs just to do my laundry.  Nonetheless, I worry about getting stuck in the elevator and have already been stuck once, by myself.  I am proud to say I didn't freak out when it finally happened.  But, you know, I never once considered the possibility that I could get stuck in the elevator  with my little divas .  It never once even remotely occurred to me that this could happen.  Never.  It happened.  Last night, while gliding up to our floor, that darling littlest diva - who has a real panache for button pushing - pushed the mail room floor, our floor, and then, just for kicks, pushed the button for another floor already below us.  Well, apparently she confused the hell out of that sardine can, because it didn't know which way to go.  Literally.  The doors closed after the mail room, then bounced.  Then moved up one floor, hesitated and bounced again.  I've experienced this before - ALONE.  And at first, I was upset with my littlest diva for playing with the buttons when I've told her before not to play with the buttons.  Oooh, I was steamed.  Until I looked at her gorgeous little face contorted with fear.  Not just the regular, scared-of-Santey-Claus-won't-sit-on-his-lap fear, no this was genuine, grade A, level one Fear.  The anger bounced out of me in that elevator and Super Mom, here to save the day, appeared.  Suddenly it occurred to me that this is scarey for me - an adult - and it was scarier for my girls.  I soothed and assured, and took charge of the elevator buttons.    The damn thing opened up on the wrong floor - one she hadn't even pushed - and we got out.  After calming everyone down and assuring them that it happens sometimes, it was nobody's fault and that it was okay to be scared, my other little diva (who is brilliant, by the way) suggested we walk to the end of the hall to the other set of elevators on the other end of the building.  So we did, and we went up to our floor in anxious silence, without further incident.  But I will never forget my daughter's face when that damn thing bounced.  She was absolutely terrified and close to panic.  I'm glad I was there, and I'm always amazed at how I am able to react to things when my girls are in need.  Their vulnerability and need somehow make me invincible - they make me Super Mom.     'Cuz, believe me, if I was by myself, I would NOT have been so brave.  Diva out.

Happy Friday!  First of all, let me start by say I hate stupid people.  Ok.  with that said, I'll tell you about the Wine Club event last night.  No stupid people there, just lots of fabulous Italian wines being poured by fabulous Italian men.  I tried an Amarone, a Lugana and a Super Tuscan (these are wines, people).  I actually drank more wine at this event than at any previous one.  And the group of attendees were all wonderfully charming people.  The weather was clear and warm with a light breeze and the spread my Chef put out was beyond belief.  All in all, I had a great night, and so did everyone else who attended.  We ended up with 28 in attendance.  A great evening, and now I'm excited for next month's event.  Already started the planning on that one.  Have a great weekend everyone.  Diva out.
Kvetchers Unite  Ever notice how some people love to complain?  Live to complain?  In fact, they get so good at it that they complain without even knowing that they're complaining.  If they're speaking, they're complaining.  Case in point, and what sparked this entry.  My coworker is a kvetcher.  She complains and you don't even realize that's what she's doing, unless you pay close attention.  She's sitting at her desk, eating her lunch.  I don't know about you, but on those occasions when I do eat lunch at my desk, I do not, under any circumstances, answer my phone.  I'm eating, for crying out loud.  But not her.  Oh, no.  She answers the ringing phone, thereby interrupting her meal.  Then she makes sure she mentions to the caller that 'You caught me eating my lunch at my desk.'  Then she tosses in a chuckle to lighten the comment.    That's how she does most of her complaining.  With a short chuckle at the end.   Its becoming annoying *chuckle*.  Diva out.

Wine Club Day!  It's the last Thursday of the month - Wine Club Day!  Can't wait.  Got a date with 10 Italians tonight... wines, people, 10 Italian wines.  And after fearing that no one would show up (as I always fear) I have 35 RSVPs for tonight and figure there will be a few who turn up without calling.  So, maybe a nice little group of about 45 guests.  It's going to be a great evening.  And, as for that gorgeous basket of goodies - I decided to leave it on my desk overnight.  Good decision, since now almost all of the cookies are gone, especially the toffee chip cookies I love so much.  Just a few chocolates and some macadamia nut cookies left.  Those toffee chip cookies were going to be the death of me - I ate 3 of them yesterday afternoon.  And we all know they go straight to the hips.  And, trust me, I don't need any more on my hips than I already have.  Did a good yoga practice last night to try and scare away any extra pounds I may have attracted with those cookies.  Hope it worked.  Diva out.

well, I was feeling good.    Then, I had to hear (again) the story of why my colleague doesn't speak to the girlfriend of the man I divorced.  Yes, you know, DBD's bread and butter.  Hey, that's what I'll refer to her as from now on (when I absolutely must add her to this blog), in acroynm form, as typing all of that out takes a lot out of a girl.  So, from henceforth, she shall be known as B&B.  Now, on with our story.  I was reminded of the reason why he doesn't like B&B.  Apparently, B&B was invited to a wedding, when she really should not have been invited at all.  But office politics being what they are... my friend 'bit the bullet' as he says, and invited B&B and DBD.  In the end, and after the final bill was rung up with 8 no shows, it turns out that DBD surprised his little B&B with a flight to the Bahamas for her birthday.  *Here's where that green-eyed monster rears up... he never took ME to the Bahamas.  Then again, I never paid his room and board either.*  So, he never spoke to her or DBD again after being so rudely slighted.  I just love hearing why people hate DBD... and B&B for that matter.  And I know I'm supposed to be over all of that, and I've moved on to much better people, places and things.  But, sometimes, that little monster comes back to gnaw on my insides just a little.  Grrr... money spent on her birthday present should have gone to pay for the welfare of our children instead.  I was living in his mother's bedroom while he was off galivanting around in the Bahamas.  Jerk.  Creep.  Worthless SOB DBD.  Ahhhhh... wow.  I feel better already.  Now if only my favorite IM'er would pop up to make my day complete.  Diva out.
Feeling good  I know... its Monday.  But I feel good.  I have been on a cloud since last Thursday, but I'm not ready to share my details on all that just yet.   The weekend was good; productive and enjoyable.  I got up early (!) on Saturday morning, went to a (free) yoga class and then volunteered at the botanical garden here on Miami Beach.  The yoga was very beginners, but sometimes its good to go back to the beginning.  After more than 4 years of practicing Ashtanga, it was refreshing to be reminded of some of the rudimentary basics of yoga.    The garden project was wonderful.  I forgot my work gloves, so I was digging in the dirt with my bare hands, and there is always something energizing about getting dirt under your finger nails.  My group of about 5 or 6 people was assigned to plant new elephant ear plants in a garden bed.  We just sat on the ground, chatting and planting.  It was great, and I can't wait to go back next month.    Easter Sunday was spent at my mother-in-law's house with my two little divas.  And while the mere mention of mother-in-law sends others shrieking into another room, my mother-in-law is really my family and friend.  She spent the early afternoon alternating between hiding plastic eggs around her apartment for the girls to 'hunt' and 'hunting' for eggs that my little one hid for her to find.  I ate WAY too many jelly beans and York peppermint patties, resulting in a sugar headache that would have made even Candy Genius curl up in the fetal position.  Mmmmm, sugar coma!  But the weekend is done, and I'm back at my desk waiting to see what today brings me.  And looking for the return of an IM that I've been missing all week.  Have a fabulous day!  Diva out.

DBD's World is about to be rocked!   Extra! Extra! New development in the child support (that is, the lack thereof) from the DBD!    While dropping the littlest diva off at her grandmother's house last night, I noticed an envelope lying in wait for the DBD (dead beat dad for you newcomers).  The only reason I noticed it was the sender's address - The State Attorney's Office.  My most favorite people, his least favorite.  I was so trying to figure out how I could swipe that letter without anyone noticing, then open it and reclose it, and finally replace it on the counter - without anyone noticing it.  I was without inspiration, so it remains, at this very moment, untouched on the counter.  *sigh*  However, I called the State Attorney's office this morning, under the guise of needing to update my address.  I moved in January, so I did really need to update them.  At the end of my call, I mentioned that taunting little envelope that I spied last night, and wondered if I would be getting a copy of whatever notice happened to be encased within.    No.  It went into my file, I was advised.  The notice was only sent to him, she told me, as the notice was a notice of delinquency.  Seems the courts don't like it when you don't play by their rules.  He has had about 6 months to come up with the last $1000 he owes the judge and has not paid up.  If he doesn't respond, a Contempt of Court will be filed against him.    In case you aren't aware, Contempt of Court IS NOT a good thing.  They can pick him up and haul him off to court and then jail.  I'm guessing that, while he was unable to cough up the grand to pay the judge, to benefit me and the girls, he will miraculously find a way to generate $1000 to get his ASS OUT OF JAIL!  So, this week ends on a delightful note of things to come.  It may take a while, but its coming... its coming.  Diva out.

I'm convinced now that the 'referrer' code doesn't really work very well.  Nevermind how long it took me to get the code to work (Candy remembers all to well I'm sure!).  It was tragic and problematic, to say the least.  And for what?!  The thing seems to arbitrarily spit up URLs that have no correlation to my page.  I've even gone and checked out a few of these so-called referrers.  There's no diva-like references, no mention of a diva in any way.  *sigh*  Just a terrible, contemptible tease that code.
Who says you can't buy happiness?  Or at least victory.  My oldest diva-ette is now 10.  As a 10 year old, she gets an allowance.  Not a set amount, and not a great amount, but its all hers.  Her only chores, currently, are to take the trash to the trash chute (10 steps from our door) and to attend to her hamster.  I pay her a dollar for each time to takes out the trash, which generally tallies up to $5 a week (once a day during the week).  Sometimes she will offer to do a load of laundry for me or take the dishes out of the dishwasher, which ups the tally by $1 each chore.  I do not offer compensation for cleaning her room or picking up her stuff from around the house; i.e. socks, shoes, clothes, books, markers, dishes, candy wrappers, etc. etc.   I just request that she do it, and do it now.  Whereby, she never fails to say, 'Ok, mommy'... and then never does any of it.  'Oh, I forgot' or 'I didn't hear you' are her pat excuses for when I go into my rant about what she didn't do.  So, now I have a strategy to improve her memory and hearing.  Now, when she forgets or doesn't hear me, it  costs her  a dollar.  At this rate, based on her current earnings, she could owe me big, fast!  This could be the best 'get rich quick' scheme ever designed.    Well, at least it will save me a few dollars in allowance.  And trust me, that dollar is so much more dear to her than it is to me.  When I announced my new plan to my little darling diva, you would think I'd told her I was cutting off a finger for each offense.  She was horror-stricken at the thought of owing ME a dollar!  I've found my mark and hit it directly.    Nevermind restricting her from TV or video games or grounding her.  Nope, money is the center of her universe; well, actually spending it is what brings her joy.  Mostly on candy or the occasional trinket or toy.    Childrearing isn't so much about strict discipline, yelling, ranting, and so on.  You just have to find their 'button'.  Children have an inherent knowledge of each parent's button - find theirs and the world is yours!  Diva out.
Sense of Achievement...  however trivial it may seem.  I've managed to read all of the blogs on my Blogroll today.  And get some work done, too.    And I'm seriously considering upgrading my blog to ProBlogger, just so I can start putting up pictures.  I'm feeling very inspired by all the photoblogs that are listed at the top of my Blogroll over there.  Just a few weeks more and I will have a bank account (that I can use) again, and with that comes the availability to shop/pay online.  I suppose I'll need that to pay for my spiffy upgraded blog.  So, there may be lots more to come in the weeks ahead... Maybe not.  But, don't stop visiting, just in case *wink*  Thanks for reading, as always.  Diva out.

Weekend Update  I just got pics from the AIDS Walk on Sunday.  It was a great day for a walk.  The sun was shining and the air was cool; never broke a sweat.  Just strolled along very nicely and chatted the entire time. I'm going to put the link to the Snapfish album I created, in case anyone cares to see it.  It may or may not work.  Thank you to my readers who were kind enough to donate to the cause.  My team raised over $1000 for Care Resource and the event, on last tally, had raised over 75K in all, and still growing.   urlLink AIDS WALK Miami 2003   After that little 3 mile stroll I stopped at the Farmer's Market on Lincoln Road.  If you ever find yourself on Miami Beach on a Sunday, you really should check it out.  Fresh fruits and flowers, the best baked bread I've ever tasted, and lots and lots of art and antiques.  And with a Starbucks Coffee on practically every block, you'll have no shortage of caffeine to fuel your day.  Then, once I was home I decided to take another short walk - yes walk - over to the Museum and Library downtown.  I live about 3 blocks away, and as I said before, the weather was just perfect for walking.  Saw a very thought-provoking exhibit by Shirin Neshat on the roles of men and women in Islamic Iran.  Also picked up 2 new books to read:  Dickens and Shakespeare.  Finished off the day with a lovely nap on the sofa.    Just love those Sunday afternoon naps!  I couldn't live without them.  So, in all it was a very pleasant weekend.  Hope yours was just as nice.  Diva out.
urlLink Top Ten Driving Tips for Miami    1.  Lane dividing lines and crosswalk markings are only suggestions and do not require to be followed explicitly.  Basically, no one pays any attention to these.  2.  Turning signals also fall under the category as Tip #1.  Either they don't get used at all, or the left signal will remain blinking for the next 20 miles.  As indicated above, basically, no one pays any attention to these.  3.  Yellow means 'Get your ass through the intersection as quickly as possible.'  4.  Red means 'Get your ass through the intersection as quickly as possible before on-coming traffic gets there.'  5.  Green sometimes means, 'Let's wait and see what color comes next!'  6.  One way streets invariably will have some jerk driving down them the other way, while blaring his horn and blaming you for paying attention to the street signs and dividing lines. *See tip #1*  7.  While travelling south in the far right lane, the car ahead of you suddenly decides to make a left U-turn (no signal required), across two lanes of southbound traffic. Then, defying on-coming northbound traffic, the driver travels across those 'suggested' lane dividers to the farthest northbound lane.  What should you do as he arbitrarily travels across 4 lanes of moving traffic?   Answer:  Nothing.   Just keep driving; slight amazement at this everyday act is allowed, but not required.  8.  Never expect anyone to ever stop at a stop sign or to yield the right of way.  Ever.  9.  When driving late at night, all rules are off.  Traffic lights are often shut down after 10pm (especially in my neighborhood) to promote 'safety' in the streets.  Generally, this means that red, yellow and green all mean the same thing: 'Get your ass through the intersection as quickly as possible.' *Note: this tip is only slightly different from our previous tip on red lights.  This is because there is generally not any on-coming traffic in the 'hood at 10pm.  The occasional slow-moving pimp-mobile or cop car, but not much else.*  10. When the bum on the corner offers to clean your windshield for a dollar, save him the effort and just give him the dollar.  You have NO IDEA what could be in that bottle of liquid, and you probably don't want it on your car!  Diva out.
Gifts of the internet  I received an email from my sister this morning.    'A friend of mine wrote this but doesn't think it's any good and she thinks my opinion is biased cause we're friends so I asked if she minded if I sent it to you.

Never Never Land  I've been subjected to watching Peter Pan twice a day, every day this week.  No, its not some strange and unusual form of punishment; my littlest diva is obsessed with the movie this week.  You know how little kids get, they need to watch the same thing over and over again until they know all the words and all the scary parts lose their scariness.  And we're not talking the Disney animated version here --oh no.  This is the 1950's(?) NBC televised live performance with Mary Martin.  It's quite good and very entertaining.  The songs stick in your head for days - you can trust me on this one.  But, after about the 4th or 5th time, my grown-up cynicism reared its ugly head and I started to see Peter Pan in a whole new light.  Actually, I started to see a few of the men that I've either dated or married personified in Mary Martin's character. *ugh!*  'I won't grow up!' 'I want to stay a boy forever!' 'He wants me to always do his spring-cleaning!' 'Can you tell stories, and tuck me in at night, and mend my pockets?'  Typical; the girl asks 'What are your exact feelings for me?'  How many times have we said that, ladies?!  At least he responds honestly, in all his boyish charm,'That of a devoted son for his mother.'  And then, at the end, Wendy's grown too old for Peter, so he invites the younger Jane to fly away with him instead.  It's all just a classic bed-time story after all, but under the glaring eyes of adulthood, its all a little too real.  Tonight, I think we'll have to pick some other movie to watch.  Unfortunately, if its another childhood fairy tale, I'm sure I'll find some fatal flaw in whatever we select.  Diva out.
While we're on the subject of Co-workers  I have another co-worker who came into the office the other day with a big plastic bag filled with clothes.  When asked, he informed me that he had just come from the thrift shop.  His partner did a little spring cleaning, and donated a bunch of things to a local charity thrift store.    Only, he didn't ask what was ready to go.  So, my friend had to go to the thrift store and BUY BACK his own clothes.  Seems he still wears most of what his partner donated.    Oops. *grin*  Diva out.
Feeling Lucky   There's been a lot of noise lately about America and Americans and the American Way.  Well, my friends, all I have to say is I feel really freakin' lucky to be American right now.  I work with a woman from Peru who has been in the US for several years under Political Asylum.  All of a sudden, Peru isn't considered a dangerous country, and Political Asylum just doesn't fly anymore.  So, she and her husband have been told that their work visas are no longer valid, effective immediately.  She and her husband have 60 days to 'find a new country.'  Basically, we don't care where you go, but you can't stay here.  She lives here, works here, goes to college here.  Or, at least she used to.  Diva out.
And now for today's real entry  What I really wanted to talk about today is my newest hobby.    I bought a bottle of Woolite over the weekend.  I'd been wanting to buy some, but haven't been able to find it in my grocery store.  It wasn't with the laundry detergents or the household cleaners, so I figured they just didn't carry it (heathens!).  I found it in some other aisle, near dishwasher detergents I think.  Or maybe it was with the bar soaps.  Once I found the elusive concoction, I had to decide on the big bottle or the little bottle.  I opted for the little one, but am beginning to realize my mistake.  Should've gone for the Jumbo bottle.  Now that I have acquired this magic elixir, I have been Wooliting everything I can get my hands on.  I've hand washed the cushions on my sofa, a dry clean only skirt and one of my favorite suits.  This particular suit is about 4 years old and while it does still look great, I just don't have much faith in dry cleaning.  After 4 years of dry cleaning, I felt the suit should see a little water - at least once in its lifetime.  Needless to say, the jacket is still drying - the bottle instructed me to 'lay flat to dry'.   Still drying.  But now, I'm looking around the house, wondering what else I can Woolite.  Decorative pillows and bath rugs beckon.  I may even put a little in the baby's bath water tonight.  And then instruct her to 'lay flat to dry.'  May be the most peace and quiet I've had in days.  Diva out.

Miscellaneous Observations  First of all, many thanks to my readers who have made a donation for the AIDS Walk this Sunday.  I'm walking a little over 3 miles and have raised more than my goal of $100.  And for the first time in doing this sort of thing, I think that's pretty darn good!  If you feel the need to do some good, there's still time to  urlLink Support Your Diva!    Observation:  None of my most intimate male friends *wink wink* have made any donations.  As always, the most supportive males in my life are not the ones I have, um... 'relations' with.   Why is that?      As far as I can tell, they don't even read my blog.  Wouldn't you think it would be a good idea to read?  Hmmph.   Observation:  I've come to the realization that I am very content just the way things are.  Well, money is still an issue, but I'm not lonely or in need of male companionship.  For a while there I was thinking 'Poor Diva.  All alone in the world without a man to call her own.'  BAH!  Over that! I curled up in my big queen-size bed last night, snuggled up to my huggie pillow and felt very content as I drifted off to sleep.  It was a very good feeling.  Of course now that I'm happiest without a man, they'll all start crawling out of the woodwork again.  That's pretty much how that works.  They just can't stand to see you happy!    Observation:  I read on a blog the other day, I think it was on 'Was it the Pagan Remark?' about a little man bashing.  Just a little.  Nevermind how very strongly I agreed with just about all of it.  I started having thoughts of my own.   * Younger men who like older woman haven't had any of the experiences yet always think they know everything. * I'm tired of men who need coddling.  These men either always have an excuse for why they didn't or couldn't do what they were supposed to do, poor babies.  In the meantime, I'm getting it done.  No excuses.  Make it happen.  But they just can't.  And there seem to be more than a few men like this around me.  It's becoming annoying.   Observation:  I've been so concerned about treating my youngest diva with nuturing love, as a baby that I've sort of overlooked my oldest little diva.  I've always had a tendency to treat her more like an adult than a child, and lately I'm seeing that she needs a little more nuturing.  She's growing up; maybe that's why I'm noticing.    Ok.  Observations over for now.  I feel like I should say something very wise and philosophical right now, but all I can think of is, 'I need another cup of coffee.'   Hmm... go thee out and seek thy coffee.   There.  Wise and philosophical.  Diva out.
Back at work  I had a whole 3 days off.  I didn't abandon my little blog or my lovely readers, I just wasn't around to update.  I've been really sick and finally decided to take a day off and go to the doctor.  And now, with a little extra rest and some antibiotics, all is well in the world of the Diva.  And, among the 183 e-mails this morning, this one was my favorite.  Subject:  The copy machine is heartbroken...  The copy machine did not make it over the weekend without hearing from you. Could you please come and see it.   The sad part is, this is the most romantic message I've received in MONTHS. *sigh*  And even sadder, I couldn't fix the machine this morning... not even my touch was enough to make it all better.  Had to call in the repair man. *another sigh*  Diva out.

urlLink      I'm completely down-to-earth!   urlLink  Find your soul type  at  urlLink kelly.moranweb.com .    You are the most in touch with knowledge. It's the tree of life from which you tap the sap. You know what you want and you know how to reasonably get it.  Virtues: You respect people with plans. When someone has their head on their shoulders, you know that they can see straightforward and keep their eyes on the mark. When it comes to looking at the future, you take a logical approach: what's within your ability? A fortunate attribute that you have is the ability to set a goal for yourself, higher than maybe you feel possible, but still keep yourself within reasonable bounds. You take the time to appreciate those surrounding you and they do appreciate you in return. Decision-making comes naturally to you when you take the time to consider each option. People only come to talk to you when they are looking for a logical, reasonable solution.  Aspirations: You have an idea of what you can do with your life, but you push it up a notch. You need a profession that you can enjoy, so work towards it. You want to live near your friends and family while being as far away as possible. You also want to settle down while working in excitement and variation.  Quirks: You don't appreciate drama queens and they don't appreciate you. When they need help, they won't seek you out because of your ability to see through their overly dramatic predicaments. You have leeway for humor, and sometimes love to participate in it, but when it becomes irrational behavior, others can count you out. Loud noises are bothersome, except when they come from you or your friends.  Factors: Reach for the sky! Don't decide to do something because you're merely good at it, but choose something you might like to do, despite whether you're sure you can master it or not. Don't only save room for a few empathetic friends, but open up to everyone.  Future: When looking for a job, if you work in all of your talents (logic, decision-making, planning, and definitely humor), you'll find yourself happy. Come to a compromise for location; live nearby your friends and take periodic vacations or live farther away and take frequent return trips.  * * *  I don't think this is me.  I'm a little more 'by the seat of my pants' than this... and planning?  Ha!  Oh well.  So much for tests.  Diva out.
Friday!  So much to say and do.    Let's see, first of all... last night's dinner was fabulous.  The seared scallop paired with the Carneros Cuvee 1991 was amazing, and the Oddysey paired with the Veal and Truffle jus... divine.  It was an amazing dinner, and quite an enjoyable evening all together.   Having the French Ambassador's party dining just a few feet away added to the fab-ness of the evening.  (No, really ~ the French Ambassador was there!)  This weekend is busy.  Going to the salon tomorrow to get my brows shaped; want to look my best for the Big Apple.  And I'm going to a Kabbalah course - on interpreting dreams on Sunday.  Meeting a friend for brunch on the north of the beach, and then going together to this course.  If nothing else, it should be interesting if not enlightening.  And at some point I have to take my two little divas to the see the newest Disney animated film, 'Finding Nemo'.   I've  They've been looking forward to this film for months!    Have a fabulous day, dear reader.   And an even better weekend!   And now, for the  urlLink Friday Five   1. What do you most want to be remembered for? ~ My ridiculously, shall we stay retarded, unrealistic optimism?  2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life? ~ 'There's more than one way to do everything.'  If I can't figure out a way to get what I want or need, I try looking at it from a different angle; there's always a way.  Or, 'To thine own self be true.'  3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year? ~ Getting a grip on my budget while still managing to keep a roof over my head, and the heads of my little divas.   4. What about the past ten years?   Bringing my girls into the world, and watching them grow.  They truly are my pride and joy.   After reading that, I reconsidered.  My girls aren't an achievement, more of a blessing.  Acheivements from the past 10 years would be learning to love unconditionally, learning to be strong and stand up for myself, learning how to take care of myself and to love myself unconditionally.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?  ~ 'Nevermind what people say.  Believe what you know in your own heart to be true.'  I've had to say that more than once to my girls lately.    Diva out.
A toast to optimism... I'll drink to that!  The internet is e x c r u t i a t i n g l y  s l o w  today.  It takes forever for a page to open, so that by the time it does open, I've forgotten why I was going there in the first place.   *bleh*  It's rainy and gray outside again.  Just another day in paradise... NOT!  And, to complete my day, I have the Wine Club Dinner tonight.  The first dinner I've done since last November, which was a great success with 100 guests.  That dinner benefitted the Boys & Girls Club of South Florida.  Tonight's dinner doesn't benefit anyone, not even me considering there are only 14 guests expected.  That's including me, the Wine rep and his guest.  *bleh again*  But, still, it should be a good night - if we don't get rained out.  14 people sitting at one great big table, conversing over glasses of Gloria Ferrer Chardonnay and Carneros Cuvee 1991, whilst nibbling on Roast Capon and Veal Medallions.  Tres yummy.  And the Wine rep will be giving out goodie bags and bottles of wine to take home.  Since there are so few attending, he can do this little extra something special.  So, more is not always better.  And, as always, I am trying to be optimistic and sunny in the face of adversity.  Besides, there's nothing a little good vino can't cure!  Diva out.

Mun-day...   Uh, no.  It's Tuesday.  Just feels like Monday.  Well, I know that as a Diva I have certain obligations.  It is my responsibility to live the glamourous life, life on the edge, yadda yadda, etc etc.  Sorry to have to let you down.  This weekend I was less Diva and more what Roseann Barr calls a 'domestic goddess'.  Yep, scrubbing toilets and folding laundry.  I did go downtown for a little window-shopping, tried on a fabulous red dress, which I intend to go back next weekend and claim for my own.  I've lost 5lbs. and this dress is exactly what I need to show off my slightly trimmed physique.

Happy Friday!   Memorial Day Weekend is here, and on South Beach that means a new kind of chaos.  Locals know to stay away, and even certain upscale parties have learned this very important lesson.  At least one of the weekend's parties has moved to downtown Miami, opting out on South Beach.  And, believe me, despite the controversy and all the talk, it has more to do with the mass quantity of people than it has to do with what kind of people are here.  We're talking gridlock, crowding, road rage... and that's on the sidewalks!  Wall to wall people strolling up and down Collins Avenue.  Driving two blocks takes 15 minutes ~ no really.  Although, this year may not be as crowded.  Several hotels are still not sold out.  And while the city hopes the crowds won't come en masse, the hotels, restaurants, clubs and shops hope they will come.  This is the last big weekend of high season for Miami ~ when we make our money ~ and we all need to make budget for May.  We count on this weekend to make budget.  If we don't do it this weekend, we just won't do it.  So, for the next three days ALL police officers are on 12 hour shifts, the 'God Squad' walks the streets 24/7, all hotel managers are living on property, bars are stocked, streets are cleaned, staff are braced.    Bring it on!  Have a great holiday weekend, everyone.  Diva out.

It was too much, I had to get upstairs into my safe little home and cocoon myself there.  Today, there was an accident a few cars ahead of me, so I just missed that one.  Its just that I really feel like I'm finally making really good decisions in my life, walking on the right path, and my trip to NY will take me further along that path and closer to a really good man.  So now I'm afraid I'm never going to make it to NY.   And today we're on high alert.  I get on a plane in 15 days, and we're on high alert.  Isn't that special?  *sigh*  Diva out.
There may be hope yet...  If a  urlLink leopard and a cow can live together in peace , there's hope for us all!  And thank goodness the mercury retrograde is over.  This was one of the strongest retrogrades I have ever experienced.  And, unfortunately, with the full moon and the eclipse thrown in, it wreaked havoc like a molatav cocktail for some people.  Since the full moon I've heard several stories of tragedy, and I had a near miss myself - just a little bumper bump yesterday.  No big deal, but Advil will be my new best friend today.  Always by my side.  *oy, my aching back*  Diva out.

Received this today, and thought if you're in the Miami area, maybe you'd like to check it out.   To all my single female friends!!!   Vince from Pre-dating and I are working on having event @ the National Hotel by the  end of June beginning of July.  I need to find out who would be interested in participating so Vince and I can determine a specific category for that event, ex. (Singles without  children, Athletic Singles, Latin Singles, Latin Women & Gringos and an age category along with it).       I tried it and it was a lot of fun! Log on to  urlLink Pre-Dating  for more information. Please  urlLink e-mail me .  The sooner I get your response the sooner we can start planning.    Hope to hear from you soon!    Vicky    Diva out!
ok.  first of all, did you know that if you hit the escape key by mistake while typing your post, your entire entry dissapears?  Guess how I know.  Now for today's entry.   Happy Monday Everybody!   Yes, I am uncharacteristically happy today, and it has everything to do with my weekend.  A friend that I haven't really seen in maybe 4 or 5 years came to Miami for the weekend.  She and her roommate kept me so busy with fun that I hardly had time to sleep.  It was such a great weekend, its amazing what a few good friends and a little dancing can do for a girl.  Friday night we attended the Ocean Drive May Issue Launch Party at a very trendy and chic South Beach hotel ~ I was in this month's issue so it was only right that I attend ;)  Then, on Saturday night I got a few more old friends together and had a group of 4 of us together for the first time in 7 years.  The last picture in my  urlLink gallery  shows you just how good it was to be together.  And, just one more reason for my current state of ecstasy... I bought a ticket to New York on Saturday.  This is a very long overdue trip, and will be a sort of mini-vacation for me.  Can't wait, and I'll probably put up some sort of countdown if I can find some free countdown online to help with that.    Hope you had a great weekend, too, dear reader.  Of course, it couldn't possibly have been nearly as fabulous as mine, because after all, you're not the Diva, I am ;)  Diva out!
Gifts received  I had the amazing experience of watching the lunar eclipse last night.  I raised a glass to toast the great goddess before her face was hidden in the earth's shadow.  I sat for about 35 minutes on my terrace with an awesome view of the whole celestial event.  Even got my opera glasses out to get a better view.  I had to wait 33 years to see my first lunar eclipse, and it was worth it.  I also had an interesting thought this morning, while waiting for the rain to pass so I could walk the two blocks from the parking lot to my office.  I forgot my umbrella at home.  I realized two things; first of all, I remembered that old addage, 'Into every life a little rain must fall'.  Believe me, its been falling for about 2 years now ~ but then I was reminded that, it doesn't fall forever.  The rain passes soon, and life goes on.  The other thing that came to me is this: While you don't have to be prepared for everything that life throws your way, you may have to be prepared to wait until it passes.  Happy Friday everyone.    Diva out.   and one more thing... I recently heard that China is considering passing a law that if you are considered to be spreading SARS to others  by going outside when sick, you will be executed.  Not confined, not quarantined, EXECUTED.  Sounds ridiculous, must be propaganda, right?  Check this out ~  urlLink This is scary.

Death by Oreo   I almost hesitate to think that this could be real, but according to  urlLink this  and  urlLink this , its true.  Oreos could be banned, or have a health warning label placed on.

Random Thoughts   Good to Remember:  Work harder. Worry more. Experience additional difficulty. Disagree with people. Feel fed up. Do you think you can manage at least some of the above? Its funny isnt it? We dont need to be told to do this kind of thing. We live in a world that more or less forces it all to happen. Yet we also live in a world that is full of grace, beauty and magic. Our lives are blessings. Our moments are gifts. Our futures are not destined to be full of drudgery. We can experience great joy and contentment at times.  Heard in the office today: 'I don't want to freak you out, but Mike Tyson is eating the garnish off your banquet table on the terrace.'  Otherwise, just another normal, quiet and uneventful Tuesday.  Diva out.
Monday  Feeling pretty good, for no good reason.  Had a decent weekend; went downtown to Miami Art Museum and the Main Library on Saturday with my kids.  It was family day at the Museum, which means free entry for families and activities for the children.  It was a good day in all.    Saturday was also the May Day project.  It started bad and ended bad.  My camera eats batteries at a ridiculous rate.  I was able to click off 6 pictures when the newly bought batteries gave out.  I was short on cash, so was unable to get more batteries.  You can see my pathetic attempt at my  urlLink May 10th Gallery .    I'll try to be better prepared for the next project.  Sunday was uneventful.  Picked up the little divas from their grandma's house; they had roses and a card for me.  It's just always nice to pick them up after being at grandma's all weekend (every weekend).   They're so happy to see me after two days away.  I sometimes wonder if I'd ever get such a warm welcome otherwise.  Off to get more coffee, with thoughts of New York in my head... will be travelling north soon.  More on that later.  Diva out.
urlLink Happy Friday Everyone!    1. Would you consider yourself an organized person? Why or why not?  ~~ Relatively organized.  I live by the rule: A place for everything, and everything in its place.  2. Do you keep some type of planner, organizer, calendar, etc. with you, and do you use it regularly?  ~~ I do have an organizer, and update it whenever something new (bill, event, etc) comes up.  3. Would you say that your desk is organized right now?  ~~ Hmmm... orderly disorder would best describe it.  4. Do you alphabetize CDs, books, and DVDs, or does it not matter?  ~~ No - can't be bothered.  I'm not anal or anything!  5. What's the hardest thing you've ever had to organize?  ~~ My life after my divorce!  Weekend plans are beginning to form.  Last weekend I walked 4 miles across a causeway connecting Miami to Miami Beach.  Very peaceful walk, and I plan to do it again this weekend.  Also want to check out a new Wine & Champagne Bar that just opened up on the beach.  I'll let you know how it all turns out ~ Have a great weekend!  One other thought before I go... someone commented this morning on how quickly the days are flying by.  We're already to the middle of May!  But then I considered this: time does fly, and before you know it this year will be over, and so will the next ten that follow this one.  That is why we must make every day count for something.  Otherwise, just let them fly by.  If you can't be bothered to make this one count, why should you care about the next one?    Diva out.

Oh, if only I could be sure...    urlLink Jonathan Cainer  says:  'Are you fighting your battle? Are you making your stand? Are you proving your point?

And somehow, you have to play your part as best you can, regardless of what this takes out of you. Thats how you feel  but is it true? Must you really worry as much, try as hard and dedicate so much energy? Life is about to get an awful lot easier and lighter.'  I hope so, I really hope so.   Diva out.

Not a family bed!  I don't know how they do it.  I'm friends with a married couple that do that whole 'family bed' thing.  You know, the WHOLE family shares one great big bed.  Mom, Dad and all the kids cozied up together.  Well, I am definitely not one of those people, and I certainly do not have a great big bed.  Unfortunately, my children do not understand this.  I've gotten used to the 4 year old climbing into my queen-size bed with me maybe 3 nights out of the week.   But last night, my 10 year old daughter crawled into bed with me around 2am.  I was like 'Uh-uh! what do you think you're doing?!'  She had a bad dream and I reluctanly gave in with a sigh.  But then, about an hour later the other one crept in as well.  So there I was, sandwiched between the two of them.  Do you have any idea how wild a child sleeps???   Hands flopping everywhere (mostly across me), legs kicking (mostly my legs) and hair falling where it may (mostly on my face!).    When the alarm sounded at 7am, I said in my cheeriest morning voice, 'That's it.  Everybody out!  Get up!'    After yesterday's sleepless night, this was just one more sleepless night.  I may have to learn how to function on 4 or 5 hours of sleep at a time.  Oh, how I need a nap! For now, I'm off to get another coca-cola...  Diva out.
MoNdAy  And, of course, I'm feeling out of sorts.  My littlest diva turned 4 yesterday, and MIL threw a nice 'little' party for her.  We ended up moving the party to the park, since we were expecting 21 adults with their children.  And this is just her immediate family!  Gotta' love those tight-knit Latin families.    Had the excrutiatingly unpleasant experience of sharing the party with DBD and B&B.  Yes, he brought her to the party, after all she pays for everything he does and has, so she may as well come along.  I was very surprised at how soothing chanting can be.  'OM' helped me through the day, and eventually I just forgot about her and had a great time anyway.  I would like to think that my apparent ease and comfort at the party really bugged her.  I still have some work to do on digging out my little anger seed in regards to those two.  I didn't sleep well last night, but it had nothing to do with that.  The party exhausted me - it really was a fun day - and so I should have been able to sleep.  I was doing pretty good until 4am when something shattered downstairs.  Sounded like a plate-glass window was completely shattered.  The noise startled me out of a pretty good sleep, and then the train passed by, and soon every little bump, shuffle, and sigh kept me awake.   Around 5:30 I considered getting out of bed, but decided to give it another try.  I was really close to sleep when the train passed again - it does so every half hour starting at 4:30am.  I did finally get back to sleep, just in time to get up.    I almost cried this morning when I heard on the radio that the Metrorail will begin 24-hour service in June.  Diva out.
After such a nice evening  Then there are those nights when I wonder how I'll ever survive motherhood.  But, those nights are few and far between... good thing for those little diva-ettes. ;)  Happy  urlLink Friday  everyone!  1. Name one song you hate to admit you like.  ~ 'Copa Cabana' by Barry Manilow (come on, you know you sing it in the shower too!)  2. Name two songs that always make you cry. ~ 'In Your Eyes' by Peter Gabriel and 'Pearls' by Sade  3. Name three songs that turn you on. ~ 'Can't Get Enough of Your Love' by Barry White, 'Throb' by Janet Jackson, and 'I Need You Tonight/You're One of My Kind' by INXS 4. Name four songs that always make you feel good. ~ 'Groove is in the Heart' by D'Lite, 'Brick House' (I don't know who its by), 'I Feel Good' by James Brown, and 'Stand by Me' (again, don't know by whom)  5. Name five songs you couldn't ever do without. ~ Probably the first five songs from Sade's Love Deluxe CD, since that's what I play to put the littlest diva to sleep every night!  Have a great weekend everyone!  Diva out.
Random Thoughts and Simple Joys  Why is that, when I was in my twenties I could eat a pint of Ben & Jerry's every day, and managed to weigh about 20 lbs less than I do now.  There's no Ben & Jerry's in my diet now, shouldn't I be magically rewarded for NOT indulging?  Hmmm... maybe I should go back to my old habits... maybe not.  Last night I was rewarded with a few simple joys - the ones in life that really count.    First, while rocking the littlest diva off to sleep last night she was fighting sleep with all she had in her.  But, of course, Mr. Sandman won in the end.  But, during her valiant fight, I watched as her eyes fought to stay open... her eyelids fluttered shut and then opened wide, just to fall half-closed again.  That simple flutter gave me such joy that a laugh started way down in my heart and rose up in my throat.  Before I could help myself I laughed out loud and woke her up a little.    Then, after putting her into her little bed, I sat down next to my older diva-ette for our bedtime chat.  She was updating her calendar planner that I gave her for Christmas.  I noticed a picture of Teddy Roosevelt on the bottom corner of a page, and asked her if she knew who he was.  She hesitated, so I tried to give her a clue by asking if she knew what his job had been.  Her lips sealed up tight, and then she said, 'Yes'.  That was it, just 'Yes.' with this sly little grin.  We both knew she had no idea, and that shared knowledge made me laugh.  'Liar!' I teased and tickled her.  Filled her in on the minor details, thinking that someday she'll learn more about President Theodore Roosevelt and, hopefully, remember our little exchange.  Those are things to be treasured... the flutter of an eyelid, a sly little smirk, a shared secret.  That's what makes my life so cherished... good thing I'm such a simple girl.  With all my troubles and worries that I have, I'm still one of the richest people I know.  Diva out.

Friday!  Maybe it's the longer daylight hours, but this week has been so  l o n g.  It's finally friday. woo-hoo.    I thought my world-traveler diva-ette was coming home on sunday, turns out she won't be back until tuesday.  i was kind of bummed when i found out last night.   here's something i don't understand.  even after reading it 10 times at least, why do i always cry after reading the last act of cyrano de bergerac?  i know how it ends.  but i still cry every time.  and before i go... it's not friday without  urlLink Friday Five    1. How are you planning to spend the summer?  ~  Road Trip! 2 weeks in a rental car with my adorable children in the backseat.  a visit to the  urlLink Gerbilman Ranch , then to mom & dad's in the Tennessee mountains, then on to Savannah and finally Disney World.  I may even fit another trip to NY into this summer.  Will take lots of pictures.  2. What was your first summer job? ~ my first summer job was babysitting when I was maybe 13 or 14.  after that i stayed away from all forms of childcare until i had my own child to care for.  3. If you could go anywhere this summer, where would you go?  ~ anywhere that i could take a nap in a hammock  4. What was your worst vacation ever? ~  a trip to orlando with the whole family - we're talking like 14 people.  ever tried keeping 14 people together and happy?  it wasn't much fun.  5. What was your best vacation ever? ~ so far, the best was my most recent trip to NY.  i'm thinking the road trip may push it's way up to number 1 though.  okay.  happy weekend to all.  diva out.
Wise words  First of all, let me say that I totally dig the new blogger look.  It will be interesting to see how many bugs are included with the new look.  Now, for those wise words.  And from an unlikely source.  There's this song on Radio Disney, I think by Hilary Duff (all parents reading this right now know EXACTLY who and what song).  This very young and not-very-world-weary child sings this wisdom into my ear at least twice a day, and I can't help but wonder who actually wrote it.  'Why not take a crazy chance?... If you miss a moment, you might lose alot; so why not?'  Pretty much describes my whole outlook on life.  But then, I'm more upbeat and carefree than most grown-ups I know ;)  Diva out.
And the other little diva  I've learned that my other daughter is in Atlantic City today.    I'm working.  She's in Atlantic City.  She's 10.  Am I the only one who finds something wrong with this?  Diva out.
Ouch!  Still on the theme of sainthood, I think I earned my wings the other night.  After having been outside for about 45 minutes and playing with a few neighbor kids, I politely informed my littlest diva that it was time to go inside.  8:15, time to get cleaned up and ready for bed.  She, being the wonderful and adorable child that she is, immediately turned into a wild, screaming and scratching beast in protest to my unreasonable demand.  I ended up carrying her off like some deranged and rabid animal, with her digging her fingernails into my shoulder and raking them across my shoulderblade and down the back my arm.  So I did what any loving and patient mother would do.  I dropped her.  Not carelessly or violently of course, but I placed her on her feet by my side, and took firm grasp of her arm as I lead her inside.  She continued her protest by screaming and crying - you'd think  I  had scratcher  her .  After giving a lecture on the importance of listening to Mommy, I decided it would be prudent to wash my newly acquired stripes with a little hydrogen peroxide.  Just to be on the safe side.   Diva out.
The Saintliness of Diva   When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?  I alternately wanted to be either an artist or a nun.  No kidding.    Some days I would make drawings, create little picture books, and doodle endlessly with the idea that one day I would use my god-given talent to create great works of art.  Other days I would drape a towel over my hair and, instead of pretending it was long flowing locks, would imagine myself in a nuns habit.  I wondered how I would look as one of gods servants.  I wasnt even Catholic.  Of course, it never occurred to me that I could possibly do both  be an artist and a servant.  Some people figured that out and created great works of art devoted to their faith and religion.  I guess it just wasnt meant for me.  These days, I dont paint or draw.  Although I've got plenty of servitude going on while I'm raising my children.  And believe me, there are plenty of days when I achieve sainthood, simply by not killing them during those more trying times.  Diva out.

Munday again  Well, I survived the weekend with my 4 year old diva-ette.  It's really hard work to keep a four-year-old entertained.  We accompanied a friend to the salon, walked over to grocery store for a snack, had lunch at Denny's (an adventure all on it's own!), went to the park, then the pool, where we got rained out.  All of this was before 4pm on Saturday!     It was great fun playing leap frog with her last night before bed time.  I need a nap.  Diva out.

Romance still has a slight heartbeat  It's not quite dead.  One of our salesmen is heading to NYC for a sales trip in July.  He's planned a weekend getaway for himself and his girlfriend before he starts working the city on that Monday.  So, he had me help him book a room at The Plaza Hotel in NYC.  He intends to take his girlfriend on a carriage ride through Central Park and propose to her.  All together now, ladies... AAAAAAWWWWWW!!!!!!

News  I didn't get a chance to see my premier appearance on Deco Drive last night, but from what I hear I didn't miss much.  No shots of the Diva, just the Wine Club itself.  Which is fine because, after all, the Wine Club is the real star.  And, in other news, I was informed last night that DBD has a job. Finally... a friggin' job.  It doesn't pay nearly as much as he is accustomed to and he will continue to search for another, higher paying job, while he takes this one.  Yeah, whatever.  The way I see it, it sure as hell pays more than unemployment.  And now I can be sure to receive at least one child support payment this year.  Let's see how long he keeps this job.  *sigh*  And even more news, my oldest diva goes to New Jersey with her grandmother tomorrow.  She'll be gone for two weeks, and will take a visit to NYC this Saturday night.  I hooked 'em up at the same hotel I stayed at when I was there two weeks ago.  Two weeks - has it been that long already?  I want to go back again soon.  Anyway, my little diva will have a good time visiting family in New Jersey, and I'll only have one littlest diva to care for while she's gone.  I miss her already.  Diva out.
Mindful Meandering  I think I'm a little like a flower.  Without a little love and attention, a little encouragement, I just wilt away.  I lose interest and fade away.  There's always a little sunshine streaming down from somewhere else anyway.  Diva out.
Huge Success  The Wine Club event was wonderful.  I had about 89 guests show up, and most of them paid (12 comps out of 89 isn't too bad).  I just love it when lots of people show up for an event; I turn into this super-human social butterfly.  Shaking hands, smiling, welcoming everyone to the party ~ you'd think it was MY party.  And in a way it is.  I got to sample a really wonderful white wine from Spain last night - I carried my glassful around all night long, nursing it for over an hour.  I'm taking a bottle of it home tonight if there's any left.  I'm thinking a little sushi and a glass or two of the white wine will finish my week off quite nicely.    I even got to do a TV interview last night.  That's right, I've graduated from print to television.  I'm not quite sure how its going to turn out and I'm not sure I want to see it when it does air.  We'll see... that may be my limit on those 15 minutes of fame. ;)  Heading out for a very quiet weekend (I hope).  Have a fabulous weekend for me!  Diva out.

Wine Club tonight!  I've planned a really big event for tonight and have 70 RSVPs; nevermind the few that didn't call but will show up anyway.    And, besides the wine tasting event, there's going to be a performance in our pool.    'Making a splash this summer, Momentum Dance Company will perform Water Study and Plunge at the National Hotel, in our famous Infinity Pool.  Performance begins at 7pm, and then immediately following this special presentation, The Wine Club presents its summer wine spectacular, featuring seasonal favorites like Zaca Mesa Viognier, Benton Lane Pinot Noir, Rene Mure Gewurztraminer, Mas de Bressades Grenache and other cool, crisp selections.  All wines will be perfectly complemented by Chef Greg McDaniels French fusion inspired hors doeuvres.'    Sounds good, huh?  I'll let you know tomorrow.  Cheers!  Diva out.
NCY Details   Brief synopsis: My hotel was in Midtown Manhattan, so I had immediate access to Broadway, Times Square, Central Park and more. MoMa Queens - saw works from true masters like Cezanne, Dali, Van Gogh (Starry Starry Night!) and Gauguin... just to name a few. Rockefeller Center - gorgeous example of true Art Deco style St. Patrick's Cathedral - arches overhead were breathtaking Radio City Music Hall - people were lining up outside to watch arrivals for the Tony Awards Washington Square - it was late, we saw the movie 2 Fast 2 Furious.  It was strange to watch Miami on the screen in New York China Town - the best Chinese food I've ever had, and my friend ordered in Chinese; it doesn't get more authentic than that! Puerto Rican Day Parade - so much fun with great music and dancing  Saw an authentic NYC rat - running along the subway track - yuck!  I took more pictures of the parade than I needed to; the edited version of my pictures (if you haven't already checked them out) is  urlLink here .  No pics of the diva this time, maybe next time.  I want to go back in August, before my girls go back to school.  Travelling is just easier that way.    I could get used to luxury hotel life; I was so disappointed last night when I got home from work to see that the maid forgot to do turndown on my bed!  I missed finding a chocolate on my pillow ~  Diva out.
Update   Pics are up.  Click on the 'Picture This' link over there on the right to see what I saw in NYC.  More later.
The Diva is Back!  More than 200 e-mails, 2 days worth of mail to open, more mail to stamp and get out, tons of voicemails and reports to catch up on... but it was all worth it!  Will post later on my fab NY trip, and will find time to load the pics too.    And one unexpected bonus to the trip, I didn't have to come in on a Monday ~ it's Tuesday already.  woo-hoo!  Diva out.
urlLink Really cool eclipse photo !
Happy Friday!  Happy Friday, indeed!  and Woo-hoo!  NYC, here I come!!  Did I use enough exclamation points!  Do you understand how very excited I am!  I'll take lots of pictures and post them when I get back on Tuesday!  Have a great weekend everybody!  I'll be having cocktails at the bar in the World Financial Center tonight!  I'll have one for you!  Diva out!
Doc, Where are you??  Did he fall off the face of the earth?  Did he join some bizarro Hindu cult while in India?  Maybe he's changing his karma and has denounced all things blogg-ish.  Or maybe he just forgot to pay his bills.  Doc, where are you?  Diva out.
This is where I will sleep this weekend:  urlLink Michelangelo Hotel  This is where I will spend my Saturday:  urlLink MoMA.org | The Museum of Modern Art  And this is where I will spend my Sunday.  urlLink Metropolitan Museum of Art   Of course, add to that a stroll through Central Park.    I can't wait!  Diva out.
Just when I thought I had it all figured out  I'm a Sagittarius.  Or so I thought.  Now, according to  urlLink this chart  I'm not.  hmmph.   Until Jonathan Cainer starts giving forecasts for Ophiuchus, the Serpent Bearer, I'm sticking with Sadge.  Diva out.
Busy Busy Busy   My boss came back from a two week vacation - some of it spent in Hawaii.  Now he's come back all energized with a great big 'S' in the middle of his chest. Ready to conquer the world and correct all the evils that have befallen our beloved hotel.  Lax attitudes, miscommunication, negative attitudes, unfocused managers, etcetera etcetera.    Friggin' Energizer Bunny in a suit.  Super GM, here to save the day.  He caught me waaaaaay off guard.  So, I don't really have much time for blogging right now.  And may have even less time.  I somehow convinced him that I would be more effective as an assistant if I actually had office/desk space near or in his office.  Right now we sit in two different offices, with a great big wall between us.  And sorry, my X-ray eyes and super-human hearing don't seem to working as well as they used to.  Could it be a plot against Super GM and the Diva?  Could Madame Kevetcher have planted cryptonite in my bottom desk drawer?  Tune in again, dear readers, to find out!  *a-hem* Sorry, got a little carried away for a second there.  Diva out.
Back in the office, back on my blog   I'm back.  I have to say that 2 weeks is too long to be away from home.  It felt sooooo good to get home on Saturday evening.  And, believe it or not, I was actually excited to be going back to work.  It's just an extension of home.  Now, I have the daunting task of uploading and organizing 275 photos.  It's going to take me a while, and before I'm done there may not be as many photos.  I'm deleting as I go.  Man, I took a lot of pictures of nothing!    I've made some progress on the photos, and you can see Fred's contribution to the photo files as well as a few of my St. Augustine pics.  Just check out my photo galleries with that link over there on the right.    That's all for now.  Tons of work to do.  But it's good to be back.  Diva out.

Absence makes the heart grow fonder   And as much as i love my family, the longer I'm absent, the better.  I remember now why I live in Miami, so very far away.  But, isn't that what growing up is about?  You know; growing up, moving away and unlearning all the wrong things your parents taught you.   You've come a long way, baby.  I head out again tomorrow.  I'm taking the Cherahola Skyway - the scenic route - through the Cherokee National Forest.  This road will lead me into Cherokee, NC where we will stop to visit the Cherokee Bear Zoo.  In Downtown Cherokee. *grin*  According to my father, his grandmother was (at least part) Cherokee, so this will be like visiting my roots; learning about my heritage.  Only with cheap souvenirs and caged 'bears, big cats and monkeys.'  Fun and educational, as the tourist brochure points out.  Then its on to Savannah.  The Hostesss City of the South.  I'm about half way through my book, and I can't wait to see the squares that are described.  We're staying on a hotel on River Street.  The River Street Inn, as a matter of fact.  We get handmade chocolates and Godiva Hot Chocolate at night.   Ooooooh, you know how I feel about turndown.  Fred had intended to leave chocolates on our pillows at the Ranch.  And despite his oversight in doing so, I have neglected to mention that we had a faaaaabulous time in Musella with Fred.  He and Pumpkin were the perfect hosts.   Gotta hit the sack now ( I may have been in the hills too long).  Long day and long drive ahead of me tomorrow... and I can't wait!  PS - I hope you are enjoying the audio posts.  I'm getting more comfortable as I go and the posts are getting longer.  I hope I'm not boring you ;)  Diva out.

greetings from NE Tennessee  I tried several times yesterday to see my blog with no luck.  Maybe blogger was down?  Anyway, I was able to see my site this morning, and it feels like home.  As weird as it might be, I've missed checking the other blogs on my blogroll.  And I was anxious to hear my posts.  I'm concerned that by mingling with all these country folk I may pick up the accent.  My nephews have it real bad, so bad that sometimes I can't understand what they're saying.  They've lived in unpopulated areas all of their lives.  Bluff City, where we are now, is the most populated area they've ever experienced.  And everyone here has varying levels of southern drawl.  It grows on you, and if you live in it long enough you pick it up.  Like a foreign language.    So, I was pleased to hear my audblog posts this morning and find that I haven't succumbed to the drawl.  I have always worked hard to keep my speech free of any identifying accents or drawls.  I'm just plain ol' diva, from nowhere and everywhere at the same time.  Everyone asks me where I'm from because they really can't tell from my speech and I like that.  Anyway, I'm having a really good time.  This is my first vacation in 7 years and for once, I'm the one sending the postcards.  I always ask travelling friends to bring me back a postcard.  Now I'm the one doing the travelling and it's nice for a change.  Tomorrow we're going to the Ripley's Aquarium in Knoxville - downtown Knoxville of course.  There's this huge tank with a tunnel you walk through that takes you under the fish and sharks.  Should be cool... maybe I could do an audblog post from under there.  Have to try that.  Diva out.

Howdy from Musella  I'm blogging from Mussella, Ga.  If you try to find it on a Georgia map, its near Lizella.  But you may not be able to find that on a map either.  It's outside of Macon, which has a really nice historic downtown district.  We're going shopping tomorrow.  Yes, even in the country, the diva finds shopping.  Now if I could just find a Starbucks...  I tried an audio blog earlier today.  Not sure if it I did it right, so if you don't  see hear it hear now, try back later.  I'll see if I can get it to work.  Diva out.
and we're off!   okay all my blogger friends.  this is it.  i start my road trip tomorrow.  an afternoon in st. augustine, a day in musella, ga on the gerbilman ranch, 10 days in bristol tn with my family, a day in savannah ga's historic district, and for the grand finale a whole day at disney.  my littlest diva is 4 and this will be her first time at the magic kingdom.  for the times when i can't get to a computer to blog, i'll be doing audioblog entries.  so, stay tuned dear readers for my sultry diva voice to seduce the internet (lol).  if nothing else, it could be a good laugh.  have a great weekend, everyone!  Diva out.
oh, one more thing.  i have discovered where i want to live.  i really want to buy a place of my own now and i really want it to be in the same area where i already live - Downtown Miami.  a developer is building lofts in my area - i love the idea. and it would allow enough space for me and my diva-ettes to lay out our yoga mats every night and really get serious about yoga.    its even close to the new Performing Arts Center, which i can't wait to be finished.  the whole miami area is really growing and changing, and i'm sort of excited about being in the thick of it all.  i'm setting my sights  urlLink here ''  I really am turning into a downtown diva!  diva out for real this time.
busy busy day  gearing up for my road trip now.  i tried to resist paying bills, but some i just had to pay, so now i will have less money than i planned for.  but i know how to work a budget and stretch a dollar like the toughest yoga asana, so i know i'll be ok.  thinking happy thoughts and looking forward to hitting the road.  but today i'm in the office with oh so many projects to complete before i go.  so, just a quick post today and then i'll get down to business.  i just wanted to comment on how multi-cultural my girls are.  i have noticed that they have so many different friends from so many races and religions, and it makes me happy.  I never knew any muslim kids, or taiwanese/chinese kids, or catholic kids or even african-american kids.  i grew up in the new era of bussing and desegregation but there was very little socializing done among the different races.  the closest i ever got to diversity was my italian/american cousins and even they lived very far away.  its encouraging for me to see my children playing with other children just because they have fun together.  and sometimes i get to share a little knowledge and teach a little tolerance.  last night, my oldest diva overheard someone talking religion by the pool.  he was talking about jesus to some muslim kids, and my daughter said, 'Muslims don't believe in god.'  I briefly explained the small differences between the two religions.  that little optimist in me can't help but believe that if i can teach my children they may teach their children.  eventually, we will all understand that we are all one.  ok.  gotta get some work done.  diva out.
And on this  urlLink SelectSmart , 9 out of 20 were JFK!

Munday  Ok, so the holiday wasn't so bad.  Worked a few hours in the AM, then went shopping!  Can you believe Burdines actually gave me a credit card?  I was shocked.  Then I shopped.  I needed a few things for my upcoming road trip, and Burdines was kind enough to foot the bill... for a little while.   It's actually part of a bigger plan for me as I hope to buy a place to call my own in the next few years.  Building my credit is required, and this is a step in the right direction.  Getting to shop is just an added bonus ;)  Spent the late afternoon to evening on the beach with about 50,000 strangers, and of course my little divas and my in-law family.  A collection of grown ups, divorced and not dating - kind of sad actually.  What's sadder is that I'm part of that group *sigh*  But we had fun, and the fireworks show was one of the best I've seen yet (they do keep getting better and better).  And for a minute or two I relaxed and had fun.    Then the pyromaniac jerks started firing up everything they could get their hands on - bottle rockets, firecrackers, jumping jacks, blah blah blah.  No consideration for the throngs of people surrounding them, the children running barefoot in the sand, the people relaxing close by.   The paranoid mom in me reared her ugly head and we got the hell out of there before some sand dune caught fire.    Then of course there was the 45 minutes of traffic to contend with.  But at least the littlest diva in the backseat fell fast asleep, so the wait was a quiet one.  Unless you count the futile horns in the background pushing everyone ahead when there was no where to go.  Breathe in, breathe out.  Wax on, wax off.  Diva out.
Happy Fourth  I'm not feeling exceptionally patriotic right now.  This never was my favorite holiday.  And this year, all the 'pops' and 'booms' just make wonder what it was like in Bagdad earlier this year, and still.  It's not just noise there.  I've always considered it strange that we would recreate a war scene to celebrate our independence.  Because, that's what the fireworks remind me of; one big boom and instantly my mind is crouched down in a foxhole somewhere, - rat-a-tat-tat - trying to stay alive.  I must have died in combat as a soldier in a previous life, because images of war and violence are just too real and scary for me.  But, my children are fortunate enough to not suffer from this overactive imagination, and they love the gleaming streaming colors in the night sky.  So, I'll watch their faces light up with delight and try not to think all those horrible ugly thoughts.  'Being touched by one's children is a delight to the body, And listening to them chatter is a joy to the ear.' -Tirukkural 65  I have my family and I have more material things and personal freedoms than so many in this world.  I was lucky enough to be born here.  I'm thankful for that, and it is something to celebrate.  So, light a sparkler up for me.     Have fun. Be safe. Diva out.
Stepping up to the soapbox  Yes, I'm in that kind of a mood today.  Read on if you like, and if you don't... ok.  I just have to say that if I hear one more newscaster report how more and more Americans are overweight, and how the FDA is stepping up and getting stricter on food labels... yada yada yada.  I'm going to throw a food pyramid and start screaming expletive RDA's at somebody!  Almost nobody I know actually reads the labels, and if they do they're looking for the one thing their doctor told them to watch out for.  Watch your sodium or watch your cholesterol.  Come on, do you really look at the back of that Oreo package to count fat grams before scarfing down the whole damn box?  Trans fats?  Yeah, whatever.  Americans are infamous for blaming everyone else for what's wrong with them.  Don't blame McDonalds for serving you a bigger burger and more fries.   If you get in your car and drive there (most of the time we don't even expend any energy to get OUT of the car - they bring the food to your car), and if you order the super-size fries and the double cheeseburger with bacon and the super-size DIET coke, then how is it their fault that you devour the whole damn thing before you even make it back home to flop down on the sofa for a nap?    Screw the food pyramid, I want my Haagen Daaz Caffe Mocha Frappe Ice Cream NOW!    Most Americans over eat and under exercise. Period.  A nice 20 or 30 minute walk at lunch time, smaller portions and more water make such a difference in the quality and length of a lifetime.  If you gotta have the Oreos, then swim a lap in the pool tomorrow.  If you're planning for a big dinner, have a light lunch.    Its easy to make the change, but its easier still to put the blame on someone else and continue to complain about how your pants don't fit like they used to.   *Diva now humbly steps down from her soapbox*   Diva out.
Worst comb-over ever  Last night I saw that the new Merriam Webster dictionary is out, and includes 10,000 new words.  Words that we use every day, but have never found in any dictionary ever before.  Words like hip hop, wack, dope and phat.  Also the word comb-over has been added.  When I saw that, I was instantly reminded of the worst comb-over I've ever seen.  Actually it was pretty recently, maybe just a week or two ago.  On Lincoln Road on South Beach, where everyone strives to be their absolute most fabulous at all times.  He was obviously from the Elvis-era.  He was in relatively good shape, considering his apparent age - I'm guessing late 50's to early 60's.  I can't even remember what he was wearing, since I was blinded by his comb-over.    Picture this if you dare:  Snow-white, Elvis side-burns, down the sides of his face to below the ears.  Then brushed w-a-y back,  over his ears  so that the ends met at the back of his mostly BALD head.   )(     As if we're not supposed to notice that he has no other hair except his sideburns.  Guys, please, if you're losing your hair and you're considering the comb-over... don't.  Go the way of MJ and Sean Connery, and just speed up nature's process by going bald.  Shave as you ruin nature's cruel joke with a mocking laugh at destiny, or be proud of your waning hairline.  Just be brave about the whole aging thing.  We women have to deal with vericose veins and sagging boobs.  You have hair loss.  Deal with it.  Diva out.
Decisions, decisions  Okay, so on the one hand I have an upcoming 2 weeks of vacation and a paycheck to blow.  On the other hand, I have an ever-inceasing debt due to the daycare.  About the amount of one paycheck at this point.  So, pay the bills or have fun?  Believe it or not, I'm actually not sure what to do.  I've got my whole trip planned, and people are excited and anxious for the arrival of the diva and her little divas.  And, after 4 years of really crappy stress and hard work, I believe I deserve a great vacation.  But, there's this little conscience jerk whispering in my ear that I really should get caught up on this bill.  It would be the right thing to do.  So, I'm working on ignoring the whisper and figuring out how to pay the bill as soon as I get back! *sigh*  I really hate being a grown up.  On a happier note,  my little jet-setter diva returns home today!  I can't wait to see her, she's probably grown 4 inches since I last saw - a whole 12 days ago.  Yay! She's home, she's home.  Of course her little sister isn't nearly as excited as I am.  She has really enjoyed being an only child for a while.  Also, I'm doing something nice for someone I care about today.  I can't wait till he gets my little surprise.  I love doing nice things for people I care about.  Diva out.
Mars Mania  Have you had a chance to see Mars yet?  It's so close to the earth right now that its just screaming 'Look at Me!' up there in the night sky.  Other than the moon and one or two constellations, it's just about the only celestial object I can identify.  And now its even easier to find.    I took a few moments to contemplate the red planet last night from my balcony, and i started to get a little nervous about what it's close proximity may portend.  All the astrologers are buzzing with the possibilities, while the astronomers are just happy to get such an upclose look.  Here's something i found this morning online.  Haven't had time to read it yet, but thought i'd share it with you.  From  urlLink Beliefnet.com .  I've already had a whirlwind of a day and my emotions have gone haywire.  I'm going to blame it on Mars, eat a pint of Ben & Jerry's tonight and just move on.  Diva out.
'You can do this.'  That's what I told my littlest diva this morning, when the tears started welling up in her big brown eyes.  We sat nose to nose; me squatted down on the red, yellow and blue rug, her perched precariously on the edge of her very small pre-k chair.  'You're brave and strong, and I know you can do this.'  She looked at me, chin quivering, and said, 'No I can't.  I can't do this, Mommy.'  I almost lost it.  I was being the brave and reassuring mommy, introducing her to the classroom, reminding her that this is just like daycare.  Telling her how her day would be busy with new faces and places and that, while it may be a little scary now, tomorrow would be better.  And I would see her this evening and she should tell me all about it.  Then I walked out of there with her with Grandma as back up.  Grandma had met us there this morning with camera in hand for this very important first day.  One diva-ette to 5th grade, one to pre-K.  Big day.  I left the class room with its miniature tables and chairs, primary colored alphabet and number charts, smiling faces and not smiling faces, with my littlest diva progressing from a whimper to a howl as I closed the door behind me.  Grandma wrapped my baby in her arms for comfort.    'I'm doing the right thing.  I'm doing the right thing.  I'm doing the right thing.' I walked down the hall and out of the school, holding back the tears welling up in my own big brown eyes.  Diva out.
Friday!!!!  woo-hoo!  yeah!  hooray!!!!  the only reason i'm so excited about today being friday is that today i pick up my little divas and bring them home.  not just for the weekend, but for good.    they've been staying with their grandmother, my mother-in-law, for the past 4 weeks.  and while it may sound nice to have a break from motherhood, i haven't really enjoyed it.  instead i've been working 10 hours a day in the office and then going home and straight to bed.  turns out i actually like being a mom.  who knew?  so my girls are coming home tonight, and we have the whole weekend together before school starts on monday.  i'm planning on indulging them in any way i can.  ice cream for dinner?  ok.  hit the pool before breakfast?  sure, let's go.  i just want to soak them in again; i'm so glad they're coming home.  and my littlest diva is all registered for pre-k - its so exciting!  i'm going to get her some uniforms today and we already bought the new school supplies.  i think i'm just as excited about the new school year as my girls.  so, no more working long long hours, no more going home to an empty apartment.  just my everyday, boring life as a single mom - just the way i like it.  have a fabulous weekend everyone - i'm looking forward to mine.  diva out.
Referrer does it again  and how exactly does my page fit in to 'pyromaniac how to make booms'????
In response  Or,   not quite myself today   Pippa, congrats and welcome home.  sorry about the tragicness of it all, and the blackout must have made motherhood that much worse ;)   Fred, i hadn't even noticed the parallels between the two - and had tried to block it all out.  thanks for reminding me.   Candy and Doc, i know you're responsible for it all.  two brains driving around the country, in the spot where the blackout occurs.  coincidence?  i think not.  say what you will, you will not convince me otherwise (hee hee)    and finally, i recieved this today, and just had to share: To those of you who send me those damn 'forward this e-mail to 10 of your friends, or else...' this is how i feel.... Click  urlLink here .  Enjoy!    BTW, thanks for all the comments, they bring me such happy happy joy joy.  Diva out.
Lights Out  Terrorism?  I think not.    urlLink Doc  is there, and think he tripped barefoot on the plug!  :P  But, really, what is it more than just a huge inconvenience?  Let's see... no lights, no a/c, no hot water for a shower, no stove to cook, no fridge.  Eating ravioli and tuna fish out of the can, drinking bottled water and warm coke.  Reading for entertainment, or listening to a battery-powered radio.  Why does this seem so familiar to me?  Oh, wait! I know, because of a little thing called Hurricane Andrew a few years ago.    No power for a week or more for some.  I didn't have hot water for about 3 weeks, but hey, a cold shower in August isn't a bad thing.    And, placed side by side with what happened on 911 or what Iraq experienced as a result of 911, this is just not as bad.  No one died in an attack, no one lost a home or family member (although some may now due to the heat or medical concerns).    It is a huge inconvenience, but fortunately not a huge tragedy.  And, helloooo - 3 day weekend.  I'm workin' here!  Don't hate me because I have perspective, people.  And really, you've got to give NY'ers credit.  They're a tough group of people who come through everything in style.  So, this is just one more thing they've lived to tell about.  Diva out.
Automatic Flatterer  Of course, you can usually find one of these in the office, but in case you can't and you need a lift; try the  urlLink Automatic Flatterer .  Have fun!  I feel better already.  Diva Out
Twisted  Had I been standing on my balcony at 7:20 this morning (instead of fighting with myself to get out of bed) I would have been able to see  urlLink this  from my balcony.  Somehow I'm not really dissappointed in missing it.  The twister touching down is just one of many strange and unpleasant things that just keep happening this month.  I'm eager for August to end, hoping that the weirdness will end with it.  Diva out.
School Daze  Okay, so the title for this post isn't exactly original.  Give me a D for creativity.  I went to register my littlest diva for pre-k today.  I thought I was going to sign her up for the city program, run out of a pavillion at a park.  I figured for $50 a month, it could be a good thing.  Except the program ends at 2pm, without an afterschool program.  And there's nobody around to take her to the public school 'afterschool' program just across the street.  So, I walked myself across the street and checked out the public pre-k program.  Yes there's space available, and no it doesn't matter that I don't live in their district.  I guess at $85 a week, they don't care where you live.  If you can afford it, your kid can attend it.    So, on the one hand I will be paying a fortune for what should be free (and will be in about 3 years), and on the other hand, I won't have to leave work everyday to walk my child across the street.  Convenience costs.  Now I have to buy the uniforms that go along with this public pre-k.  The good news is my oldest diva goes to the same public school (its actually very good), and some of her uniform tops may be handed down to our newest pre-k student.  I just have to tack on a couple hundred dollars to my already very expensive August.  Come on, tax credit!  Diva out.
IM Etiquette  Considering the current trend over at  urlLink frenchy's , I should probably be asking her this.  When using IM, how long do you wait before deciding that you are being intenionally ignored?  Is it rude to send a message when someone has the status set at 'busy'?  Should you expect a response, if the status is 'busy'?  And if you send a note to someone who is 'busy' and they NEVER respond, should you assume that you are being ignored?  It took me a while to master certain social standards in the human world.  Modern cyber etiquette may take me forever to figure out.  *sigh*  Diva out.
Culture Club  Tonight, I'm going to see a French film accompanied by a light picnic.  I've been invited as a result of my last Wine Club event.  I worked with the Miami Beach Film Society on my last event, so now they've invited me to this event at their newly opened Cinemateque.  I'm so excited - mostly because this event will be free for me.  Tomorrow, I'll take my girls to the Miami Art Museum for family day.  Also a free event.   Followed by the library - that's right... free.  I just love that I am able to soak up so much culture for free.  Also, its just been decided that we are going to take advantage of a city-wide cultural program called Artists in Residence.  We will exhibit the work of 8 artists staying on Miami Beach for the month of August and use the mailing lists of three large organizations in addition to my own.  Art, culture, wine and hors d'oeuvres.  Who could ask for more - and we should expect about 300 guests (a record for my Wine Club events).  We'll hold an event sponsored by the city, and for once the attendees will be paying to attend!  I'm so excited about this event that I can't wait to get to work on it.    Life at work is good, and the fringe benefits that come with it help keep me smiling.   Have a fabulous weekend!  Diva out.
and  *ahem*   ... 2400 today!    Woo-hoo!  :)
That's interesting   Well, friends, after having seen 'Pirates of the Caribbean' last night, I have to say that the quiz down there was right.  I am most like Jack Sparrow.  I mean, you know, without the heavy black eye makeup, the braided goatee, the gold teeth and the really dirty fingernails *yuck*.  And I'm not quite as quircky as that character.  At least I don't think I am; although some of my friends may argue that point.  But there are many similarities; for example people will often underestimate my capabilities.  And god knows I get by on more luck than strategy.  I do have a tendency to wax verbose and poetic, and I have a very deep-seated faith in my self and in who I am.  I genuinely believe that as long as I stay focused on my goal, I will achieve it.  Its completely unthinkable that I won't finally get exactly what I want.  And then there's that whole lust for freedom that we share.  The movie had its strengths and weaknesses.  Also, being a Disney movie, it couldn't help but poke fun at the ride at Disney World.  The little dog with the key outside the cell... that's in the movie.  And Capt. Jack Sparrow makes a clever joke about the dog - but not everyone in the theater laughed.  Maybe they've never been.    I laughed a lot, and I left there feeling really good.  That's what a movie should do, I think.  I felt elated and free when I walked out of the theater; sort of like Jack in the closing scene as he stood at the helm and headed for the horizon.  Diva out.
My day was better  Just when you think things are rough, you find out someone else has it rougher.  I spoke with DBD this morning to find out when I can expect my first child support payment from his new job.  He informed me that he wasn't sure, but that I would be receiving something very soon, since he was arrested over the weekend.  What!  Yup.  DBD went to jail over the weekend.  He was stopped while driving and as there was a warrant out for his arrest, he was taken into custody.  He had to borrow $1000 - exactly what he's owed the judge for purge for almost a year - to get himself out of jail.  I feel bad that it went that far.  I never really wanted him to be arrested.  But, he could have borrowed the damn money when he got the notice of contempt a few months ago.  Avoiding his responsibilities finally caught up with him.    The amazing thing is that no one in his family told me about this.  I was there all day Saturday and not one person said anything.    So, at least I should be able to get my car out of the shop soon.  What he had to pay to get out will come directly to me - and it should do so very soon.  Diva out.
An Epiphany  Fred, you probably should stop reading this right now. I know how you hate it when I get philosophical.  But I had an epiphany last night.  I was practicing yoga and almost ready to go into the rest pose when it hit me.  I've always said that pain is a warning, but I never really fully understood that, until last night.   I didn't hurt myself or anything.  I was sitting with my legs (almost) in lotus, with my forehead resting on the floor.  And I had this urge in the back of my head to sit up.  I resisted as long as I could, but then I realized that I needed to sit up.  The urge was strong enough to push me up.    In that position, I always think about being a seed buried deep in the dirt.  What makes it want to grow?  It must be that urge to rise.  The hunger and need to change and grow.  You know how an old pair of shoes can just start to hurt?  Time for new ones.  Or when those size 6 jeans just don't fit anymore?  Time to acknowledge there's been a change, and react with a change of jeans.    On a deeper level, sometimes when we feel like something just isn't right it's because we need to grow, to make a change.  The hard part isn't only noticing the hurt, but also figuring out what's causing the hurt.  Discovering what needs to change can be so very hard.  But, once you figure it out, the ache goes away.  That little urge inside you, bugging the hell out of you, quiets down and goes away when you've taken the right action and made the right change.  Everything changes, and when we don't change too, it just hurts.  Diva out.

The Word of the Day   navel-gazing \NAY-vul-GAY-zing\ noun   : useless or excessive self-contemplation    Example sentence: Instead of more of the feel-good lyrics and beats that launched her to stardom, the songs on the diva's sophomore release border on tedious philosophizing and navel-gazing.    Did you know? If you are scratching your head over something, then you are probably in a state of puzzled contemplation. But if you are staring at your navel, you could either be indulging in some useless self-contemplation or in a state of deep meditation. If the latter, the technical term for your activity would be 'omphaloskepsis,' which is a form of meditation that has been practiced by mystics for centuries. Navel-gazing is a pop form of omphaloskepsis that is devoid of any serious meditative value. The word has been used more or less depreciatingly since its first appearance in 1963.   NOTE: Today's Word of the Day can be found in the NEW Eleventh Edition of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, along with more than 10,000 new words and senses.

Little Miss Know-it-all   Last night my littlest diva announced that she knows everything.  Of course, I, in my infinite wisdom and understanding, explained to her gently that she can't know  everything , no one knows  everything .  Then my other diva-ette began quizzing her, 'Oh.  You know everything?  Ok, so what's 2 + 2?'    Then they went back and forth with tests of knowledge.  I just smiled and enjoyed the happy chatter and banter.  This morning when I dropped her off at class, what's the first thing I hear from another mother?  'Your daughter knows everything! She always has the answers to all my questions, she's little miss 4-1-1.'  So, apparently I was wrong.  She does know  everything .    Diva out.
My babies are growing up *sob*   This morning, the littlest diva announced that she wanted her big sister to take her to class.  Not her mommy, her sister.  I was dumbfounded; I responded with something like, 'Really?  Are you sure?'  She was sure alright.  So instead of parking and walking her to class, I pulled into the drop off lane along side the school.  I was still in disbelief, but they popped off their seatbelts, gathered their things and hopped out.  I had to beg for a goodbye kiss from the little one - she was already half way out the door.    I watched with tears welling up as the two of them walked hand in hand into the school, the littlest one's lunchbag dangling down past her knees because she's just so small.  If I had a camera I would have clicked off a picture of this; the day my diva-ettes worked together without me to guide them.    WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  Diva out.
Munday  Not such a bad monday, as monday's go.  Called the Child Support Division bright and early this morning to find out the status of that bond payment DBD payed at the beginning of August.  Still waiting on that nice little chunk of change and wanted to know when I could expect it in my pocket.  Turns out whoever was supposed to set the court date didn't set the court date.  Now the lady I spoke to has to contact the legal department to get the date set.  I can't get my grubby little hands on that money until the judge releases it to me.  i'm thinking some little date-setter had a nice little shopping spree with my money!  Anyway, it would appear that I now have the wheels in motion, and maybe I'll get a notice in the mail or something.    Figures now that the mercury retrograde is over things are starting to move along.  Diva out.
Back in Happy Mode  I was feeling a little off kilter for a few days, but I'm back to my old happy self again.  It never takes long... to paraphrase a song I hear last night, You can't keep a good girl down!  Went to see the new Woody Allen film last night.  Its only the 2nd or 3rd movie of his that I've seen, but I really really liked it.   I love his selection of music in this movie, and his sense of humor is slightly more dark and twisted than usual (if that's possible).  There were some really creative shots and extremely subtle jokes, and the solo performed by Stockard Channing was moving and sad, to say the least.    Woody's looking pretty old these days, but maybe that was part of the character.  It was hard to tell, because he was pretty much playing himself in this one.  I'm no expert on Woody Allen thoughy, so you go check it out and let me know what you think.  Also, I heard an amazing vocalist last night. After the (Free) movie I went to a (free) live performance of a man who calls himself  urlLink Big Brooklyn Red .  He has a voice that reminded me of sunlight glinting on a pool of water.  Honestly.  When he sang, his voice went from just a regular sound with strong urban influence to this powerful, smooth and clear truth.  After singing three songs, he said he had run out of material.  I thought, 'What! this guy only has 3 songs?!  Then he asked someone to suggest a theme, and he'll sing about it.  IMPROVISATIONAL SONGWRITING.  It was amazing.  Someone yelled out, 'Black Power!'.   Everyone laughed.  Not at the subject matter, but at the implications it represented.   Big Brooklyn Red is a slightly rounded, average height caucasion, ruddy complexion with blond hair twisted into a braid, laying lifeless down his back.  Very cool shades cover his, probably blue, eyes from the bright stage lights.  But, he did it.  It was phenomenal how the band jammed together on a completely improv'ed beat and tune, and then he picked up with lyrics that he gathered from the air around him.  One of his lines included, 'I've been every color, black, white, brown and yellow' and he spoke of how he understands so much more than a white man should, and the chorus was something about 'Whites rock and roll, why don't you just stay easy.  All that black power, gonna make you greasy.'  It was gritty with a funky Shaft kind of groove, and the crowd was overwhelmed by this white man in shades.    At least I know I was.  Diva out.
Bonus Blog   Diva innocently answers phone - mistake #1: 'Hello, may I help you?'  Crazy lady at other end, 'Yes.  I received a message from Joe Schmoe saying that supposedly he works for your hotel and arranges hotel accommodations for production and movie industry clients, and supposedly he is planning a trip to LA and is setting appointments to meet with potential clients.'  Poor trusting and clueless Diva responds, 'Yes. That's right.  Joe does work for us and he is planning his trip to LA.  How can I help you?'  Crazy Lady: 'I want to know how he got my number!'  Innocent Diva: 'Oh.  Well, I don't know, but he may have gotten it from an Industry Directory.  He's never been to LA before and he's very excited about meeting with industry clients in that area.   Are you involved in the production industry?'  Crazy Lady: 'No, I'm not.'  Diva: 'Oh.  Well, then its possible he misdialed.'  Crazy Lady: 'No. I don't think so.  I want to know how he got my number.'   .  Diva, trying to find a clue here: 'Did he address you by name in his message?'  Crazy Lady, taking every piece of info she can get, 'Yes, I think he did.  How did he get my number? I want to know how he got my cell phone number!'  Diva, still trying to be helpful: 'I'm sorry but I don't know how he got your number.  Would you like to speak to him?'  Crazy Lady: 'Yes, I would'.  Diva tries to transfer call, but Joe Schmoe is not at his desk and the voicemail picks up.  A smart Diva would have sent Crazy Lady into Voicemail Nirvana, but instead she goes back to the caller.  This is mistake #2.  Diva: 'I'm sorry, but Mr. Schmoe is not at his desk and I'm getting his voicemail.  If you'd like, I can take your information and investigate this for you.'  Crazy Lady: 'Yes, that's fine.  And can I call you back for the details?'  Diva: 'If you will give me your name and number and the company you work for, I can find out for you and call you back.'  Crazy Lady: 'No, that's ok.  I don't want to give you my number.'  Diva, 'Who am I speaking with?'  Crazy Lady pauses deviously:'...Kimberly.  And nevermind, I'll find this out my own way!'  Poor, dazed Diva hears Krazy Kimberly's 'click' on the other end.  Moral of the story?  Anybody, anybody?    Diva out

Ignorance is Bliss   If thats the case, then there are lots of really happy people out there.  I occasionally experience an oblivious person on the street; you know, that guy who doesnt realize anyone else exists in the world.  But, Ive had three such run-ins in the past 6 or 7 days so now Im starting to get a little peeved.  Last week, after I made a left and began to merge into the right lane for a right turn, I discovered that the lady to my right had done the exact same thing.  Only, my turn was legal.  She made a left turn from the middle lane, to my right and then slowed to make the same right turn.  There was no one behind me, so I was able to stop dead in the road and wait for this oblivious woman to make her turn; I then merged right to make my right turn.  If I had been as oblivious as her, I would have merged right INTO her, instead of behind her.  She drove on, never realizing what had happened.  Then, yesterday I made a U-turn so that I could park my car at a meter; a van behind me did the same.  I pulled up behind a lady who was backing into a parallel space and waited for her to pull ahead into the space in front of her.  The van sat behind me, waiting for me waiting for her.  We both assumed that this lady knew we were behind her, waiting on her.  Instead, she remained in the 2nd space instead of pulling ahead to the first space.  I had to back up a little so that I could then maneuver my car into the space behind her, causing the van to back up to make room for me to back up, and then the van had to do the whole thing behind me.  And she never even realized what she had caused  she was oblivious.  Then, this morning, in that same damn left turn, merge into right lane turn (I do this each morning), a man turned left from the turning lane as he should.  But, instead of merging to the right as soon as he could, he waited until he was at the right turn.  I was already in the right lane, getting ready to make the right, when this guy veers into the right lane without signaling, cutting me off as he makes the right turn.  I had to brake, then turn.  He just drove on, oblivious.  Maybe Im just too sensitive to these things right now; maybe these things are reminders to me to be more aware.  Im sure they are reminders for me to avoid anger and act with loving kindness (something Im always working on!).  My question is, how do people live so mindlessly every day?  Its sad and frightening for me to consider that people can just bowl through every day without ever looking up from the edge of their noses to see whats going on around them.  Living mindfully is something that I strive for every day and part of that, to me, means being aware of your surroundings and being aware of your actions.    So, today, I must ask you, my dear reader, to be mindful.  Just for today, stop and consider whats going on around you.  Look before you change a lane or turn a corner.  Think about what youre going to say before you say it.  Chew your food.  Taste your coffee.  Be aware of the air you breathe and the space you occupy.  Please, just for one day, for me.  And Ill try a little harder today, too.  Thanks.  Diva out.
I love Jonathon Cainer  This man is brilliant... how he does it I just don't know, but he is always so on it!   Tuesday, 9th September 2003  SAGITTARIUS  (Nov 23 - Dec 21)   For a long time you have been living in hope. A change is on the way. This ought to be good news but you find it slightly disturbing. Somehow, in your effort to make a waiting process bearable, you have managed to make it comfortable. Indeed, you have settled so well into your psychological seat that you no longer feel inclined to get out of it. You have not forgotten what it was you were hoping for, but you now see that, if a dream really is to become a reality, awkward adjustments must be made. Indeed they will. But you won't regret this.   Millions may not understand, but believe me; on this one he is so right its scary.  Has something to do with the sing-song a few entries down and I'm still too superstitious to really say much about it.  I just hope that he's referring to what I think/hope he's referring to.  More later... maybe.  Diva out.
Munday  Had a very relaxing weekend.  The little divas went to Grandma's so I got to sleep in on Saturday and Sunday - nothing more delicious than sleeping in on the weekends.  My hair is back to a rich brown - sans gray - espresso was the name on the box.  so, after a few extra hours of beauty sleep and a dip in dye, I'm feeling most fabulous once again.  Why, I may even paint my toenails tonight!  Ooh, such decadence.  And littlest diva's pre-k teacher came up with a great way of avoiding the morning separation anxiety drama that we've all been subjected to for two weeks now.  Instead of prying her off my leg as I attempt to escape the classroom, the teacher meets us in the cafeteria.  This way, there is a smoother transition from daughter to student.  And you know what?  It works!  I left that little girl in her blue and beige uniform, with tweety bird lunchbox slung across her shoulder, hand in hand with her teacher.  Bye, baby... kiss kiss.  And out the door I went.  No drama, no tears.  Life is good.   ** one note - i've been visiting the blogs that I know and love, and have tried leaving comments.  Sometimes I can, but most of the time my server won't let me leave lovenotes.  Security is so tight on the internet these days, its just so annoying! so, thanks for your comments, and hopefully I will be able to speak my mind on your blog again soon ;)  Diva out.

Back to NoRmAL  Whatever that is ;)  But I am back in my office, no more bouncing back and forth between two hotels.  I was filling in for the admin at our sister property.  Two hotels, two assistants, One General Manager.  My boss bounces between two hotels every day; I did it for two weeks and am totally wiped out.  I don't know how he does it.  And, a note on the beliefnet.com article on Mars that I listed below.  It's not very good.  So if you haven't read it yet, don't bother.  They managed to confuse the Mercury retrograde with the Mars retrograde (both of which are occurring right now).  Life has slowed down a bit, thanks to the retrogrades - but maybe just for me.  So much is going on around me that I almost feel like I'm sitting in the eye of a storm.  Considering we're deep in hurricane season now (weatherwise, that is), let's hope that I don't end up in an actual storm... that's something I do NOT need right now.  Diva out.
Happy Halloween!   I'm struggling today with a bad attitude.    I'm surrounded by people who never celebrated Halloween as children (or as adults even), so they lack the traditionalism that I have as an American celebrating this very American holiday.  For me, a pumpkin carving contest should focus on carving the pumpkin.  But not so here.  Here, they dress them up as waiters and maids - full life-size bodies with a pumpkin for a head.  That's more of a scarecrow than a pumpkin as far as I'm concerned.  They look great, but they're not really jack-o-lanterns.  And I refuse to give in; I spent more than an hour scooping and carving on Wednesday night, so that my pumpkin is a close rendition of a  urlLink Tamara de Lempicka painting of two women's faces .  I did it because I wanted to see if I could.  Tamara de Lempicka is the hotel's 'patroness' and we have several of her paintings hanging.  Our restaurant is named after her.   Of course there's also this horrible little hope that I could win some cash for my efforts.  But then I remember who I work with.  People from other cultures who don't get the traditional meaning of 'carved'.  I'm a traditionalist, and I guess I'll end up suffering for my art.   urlLink But I did it  - it looks good and I'm satisfied with my art.  So, Happy Halloween everyone - traditional or not :P  Diva out    PS - Update on the pumpkin - I actually won 2nd place and $50 for my efforts! Yay!
You know that feeling you get when you look at really old family photographs?   urlLink Look at me  gives me that same nostalgic feeling, and I don't know anyone in any of the pictures.  But then, again I hardly know the people in my family photos either.  Looking at the found photos collected at this website, I can start to imagine that  these people  are my family.  Or, at the very least, just like the people that I call family.  Diva out.
Oy Vey Am I tired!  Last night I went to a Jewish Wedding.  An orthodox Jewish wedding, where girls sit on one side and boys sit on the other.  It was my first wedding of this faith, and it was nice.  I was a little surprised when the Rabbi starting singing, with three little old men as back up singers to his right.    I probably would have enjoyed the ceremony more had it not been completely in French.  And i got there about 45 minutes late.  It took two hours to trek over to Hialeah to drop off the girls at grandma's house.    But, I had fun at the reception.  I danced the hourah (i know i misspelled that one!) and watched as my friend, the bride, was lifted high above everyone's heads in the 'chair of honor'.  And there was a great mix of American and French music over several decades.  I danced, I ate, I laughed.    Going home afterwards was not fun.   I got stopped about a block from my house since the lights on the left side of my car don't work.  I don't know why, they just don't.  After informing me of all my faults, and asking if my children are buckled up, he ran my license and found that I'm an honest citizen.  He let me go home, telling me to get my lights fixed.    After getting in around 2am, I think I got about 3 hours of good sleep, what with the full stomach and my littlest diva tossing and turning in bed beside me.    Today my oldest diva-ette goes to her first elementary school Halloween Dance, replete with costume, yummy treats and dancing.  I'm going to drop in for a quick photo.  I'll be sure to share it as soon as I can.  Diva out.
Indian Art  This is probably meant to encourage detachment, but it feels more like poetry... its just beautiful.

Whoooosh  My horoscope warned that things would speed up in the end of October, and changes would come.  But I wasn't really prepared for all of this.  My neck hurts, literally, from all the changes going on around me.  I'm so tense, and that's just not like me.  I laid in bed last night trying to find a comfortable spot in my pillow - my neck and shoulders were so tense it hurt to lie still.  I mean, its good that things are moving along again, after the long slow Mercury retrograde last month, but...  Life is just a blur right now.  To wit:  My boss, who used to travel between two hotels, just informed everyone that he will no longer traverse between the two.  He stays here, a new GM goes there.  Which means the pressure will be on me all 40 hours of every work week.  People are getting hired and fired so fast that I feel like I'm working in a new place myself.  Too many new faces and names I can't remember make me a little nervous.  CFF Wine Opener event is next Tuesday; I still have 94 tickets to sell.  Now I'm getting lots of requests, but no closed deals today.  Hands on Miami Day is approaching very fast; at least I've managed to get 8 team members out of my 350+ coworkers.  My boyfriend in NY finally received a reply from one of the resumes he sent out.  He's got an interview - in Dallas.  We'll see what happens there.  On a good note, I finally received the court date to recieve the bail payment DBD had to pay the first weekend of August - when he got picked up on a warrant for not paying child support.  *Note - he's still not sending any money.  Also, I just received the loan check from my 401(k) - I've been trying to locate my funds since we shifted from one company to another since August.  I finally got the right phone number and found my money.  Now I can pay October's rent.   See what I mean - whooosh!  Diva out.
Revitalized  My service-mindedness has returned, and Im feeling energized again.  Much of this is due to the weekend I had and several messages I received during the past two days.  I got up early and volunteered at The Botanical Garden again.  I always enjoy the time spent puttering around in the dirt, beautifying the garden and doing good for Mother Nature.  I shared my concerns about getting a team together at work for a big volunteer project on November 1st and the lack of interest and teamwork I experience in the office.  Someone reminded me that you cant make people want to help, just offer the opportunity and hope that they get involved.  Then, at church on Sunday, the message was all about partnership in service.  What service means and how it means different things to different people and why some people just dont get involved.  Someone else spoke on how to energize yourself after doing service for others.  Last night I attended an Appreciation Dinner hosted by the Dragon Boat Race Committee and I received a certificate for my efforts at the event last weekend.  I was touched by the consideration, and the food was really good.  Toward the end of the evening, the volunteer coordinator commented on how his faith had been restored after witnessing the willingness of people to get involved and help out.    He took the words right out of my mouth.  Im working on getting a team together for Hands On Miami Day and will plan an appreciation luncheon right afterwards.  Maybe certificates of appreciation for the participants are in order  Diva out

Big Day in the Lobby   I've seen some pretty interesting things in our hotel's main lobby.  After all, we're here on South Beach, and things are always pretty interesting.  But, today was definitely a red letter day.  Earlier today I went out to the lobby for something or other, and ran into the Power Puff Girls.  No, really.  The Power Puff Girls , and that monkey Mojo Jojo.  Big as life, standing in the lobby for some group that focuses on children's programs in Latin America.  As if that weren't enough, I just witnessed a wedding at the Concierge lobby.  Not the meaningless ceremony with dress and cake, etc.  But the signing of the Marriage License for a wedding ceremony that happened here on Sunday.  Because, let's face it, you can do all the ceremonies you want.  Without that signed piece of paper its all meaningless.  So, as I was witnessing the signing, I signed as a witness on the license.  What a job I have.  Diva out.
God & Eve    'God, I have a problem.'   'What's the problem, Eve?'   'I know that you created me and provided this beautiful garden and all of these wonderful animals, as well as that hilarious snake, but I'm just not happy.'   'And why is that, Eve?'   'God, I am lonely, and I'm sick to death of apples.'   'Well, in that case, Eve, I have a solution. I shall create a man for you.'   'Man? What is that, God?'   'A flawed creature, with many bad traits. He'll lie, cheat and be vain; all in all, he'll give you a hard time. But he'll be bigger, faster and will like to hunt and kill things. He will look silly when aroused, but since you've been complaining, I'll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your physical needs. He will be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting and kicking a ball about. He won't be too smart, so he will also need your advice to think properly.'

Update!  I mentioned to my boss (wonderful man that he is) that I'm off the event planning committee, and explained my personal reason.  Turns out, the owner loves the idea of having the party at the Garden and has already approved it.    So, he said to let the other woman do her due-diligence in looking at other venues, then we veto her and hold it at the garden anyway.  It's not really very nice, but it makes me happy.  Is that bad?  Diva out.
Lost  I have somehow lost my sense of service recently, and don't know where to find it.  I am always happy to assist with any event, charity or fund-raiser and was always the team leader to organize groups here at work to get involved.  But, after trying to encourage involvement here at work in so many events to no avail, I'm starting to feel discouraged.  After my choice for location was not accepted, I have backed away from planning the employee holiday party.  My idea of the party was that it could be held in a lovely botanical garden at night, here on Miami Beach.  Outside in December in Miami is wonderful weather, generally temperatures range anywhere from 60 to 75 degrees.  We wouldn't have to pay a rental fee, saving $1500 on our limited budget.  Minimal decoration would be needed, leaving more money for food and prizes for staff.  But, someone on the committee is concerned about rain, and wants to find an indoor venue.  One that will cost more money and probably not provide the quality of food that we would get at the Garden.  This person had nothing good to say about our last employee function, but couldn't provide any good input or alternatives.  I just don't want to work with her now.  I'm not going to form a team for Hands On Miami Day on November 1st.  The last time I got involved, it was just me and one of the owner's daughters.  It was embarrassing to see that a company of 500 could only muster the energy of 2.  No one is interested, so I'm not wasting my time with them.  I'll be at Hands On Miami Day, but I'm not working to get a team together.  And I'm not even sure I want to get the two hotels involved in the Toys for Tots program this year, since there was very little participation when we did it two years ago.  But, I'm volunteering for any pick up sites that may need help.  So, maybe I haven't lost my sense of service, just my interest in getting the people that I work with involved in things they don't want to do.  I have so many other things that I can spend my energy on.  What's that bibilical saying about not throwing pearls to the pigs?  Something like that.   I feel like I'm doing something wrong, and maybe I need to get my heart back in the right place.  But for now, I just want to stick to this non-involvement.  Maybe I'm just pouting, or maybe I'm growing up a little.  Diva out.

Sights & Sounds, part Deux  After listening to my own audio blog, I figured maybe I should explain some of the sounds you hear in that entry.  As the boats approach, you begin to hear a single drum beat, repeated over and over.  Then, there's the steerer, calling the strokes, 1 - 2 - 3...  As the boats get nearer to the finish line, the announcer is cheering on the teams, and encouraging the onlookers to cheer them on as well.  Then, near the end of the entry, there's the finish line caller, watching the line and calling out the boats as they cross the finish, 1! 2! 3!.  It's really very exciting, from the anxious waiting for the race to begin to the final moment when the last boat crosses the finish.    If you ever get the opportunity to attend one of these races, I would highly recommend it.   urlLink Pictures are up now  to help fill in the sounds to give your imagination a more complete image.  Diva out.
Sights and Sounds  You can hear the sound of a Dragon Boat Race when you click the audio post below (everyone but Fred, that is).  And soon I will post photos at my  urlLink pbase gallery .  Link is to the right -->.  Had a great weekend, filled with sights, sounds and smells all Asian.  Chinese food, music and traditional dance surrounded me.  And I never realized so many Asians speak Spanish!  I met a very nice young Asian lady who was born in Panama.  So many Asians live in South America or marry South Americans... who knew!  There's another Dragon Boat race in Downtown Miami this weekend.  I'm going to attend, and take my girls.  But this time I won't be working the event, I'll be partaking.  mmmm, egg rolls and dumplings.   Diva out.

Deep Thoughts   'They say it is to know union with love That the soul takes union with the body.   Love makes a man affectionate toward all, And affection affords the priceless treasure of friendship.   They say love's greatness is this: it yields to good families Worldly happiness here and heavenly bliss there.'  -Tirukkural 8:72-74  I like this.  And as I watched my girls walking off together to class this morning, I must say that I felt that worldly happiness.  It felt good to know I have these two beautiful girls to love every day that I'm here.    Yep, Diva's feeling deep, philosophical and lovey this morning.  Can you feel the love?  Peace, love and laughs to all.  Diva out.
The Dragons are coming!   For some reason, there is an increase in Asian culture in Miami.  And I couldn't be happier.  I'm volunteering this weekend with the  urlLink First Annual Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival  this weekend.  I'll be behind the performance stage, doing whatever they need me to do.  Hope I can actually see the boats from where I'm stationed.  I'm looking forward to the exciting races, with the deep beating of drums urging paddlers to row faster.  I'm also looking to the food and merchandise.  I'm hoping to find a relatively inexpensive Kwan Yin statue for my altar at home.  And its really hard to find good Chinese food, so maybe this will be a very  tasty  event.  And, I must confess, I am looking forward to all of the Asian men.  My Asian boyfriend in NY sounded just a little jealous when he pointed out this very obvious benefit to this particular event.  I do like Asian men *blushing slightly*.  So, this is pretty much a win-win for me.  I get to do good by helping others, bring cultural awareness to the city, eat good food, shop, see great cultural performances, and enjoy the eye candy as well.    Now if only my ankle would stop hurting long enough for me to enjoy all of it.  If you're in the Miami Beach area, you may want to check this out too!  Diva out.
Is this progress?  Sometimes its hard to tell whether I'm moving forward or backward.  So, let us review, shall we?  Littlest diva has recovered from her week-long fever.  Only last night did I find the source of the fever - she's cutting a new tooth near the back of her jaw.  Molar I guess.  So, now I know what caused the fever, and I know I can look forward to another week long fever episode soon - when the tooth on the other side starts.  My office space is almost done.  Its sort of miraculous how these men have managed to tear down walls and what-not and put up new walls and such.  Its like the bathroom never existed at all.  I should have my *new* desk and chair by next week and will move in then.  My ankle still hurts and is still slightly swollen.  Not 8-months-pregnant-swollen, but swollen nonetheless.  And I discovered a lovely bruise of deep deep purple just below my right ankle, which explains why this sprain hurt more than any other I can recall.  I thought I broke it, but no.  Just a sprain.  I'm getting caught up at work, and I've managed to sell 4 tickets to the  urlLink Cystic Fibrosis Miami Wine Opener  - only 96 more to go!  Let me know if you're interested in tickets - I've got plenty.  So, perhaps there is some progress, now that I step back and look at it all.  Not bad, Diva, not bad.  Diva out.
So I'm NOT the only one...  while i've been out of the dating scene for a while now,  its nice to know that I wasn't alone in my  urlLink dating ethics .  As for my volleyballish ankle, we're hobbling along just fine today.  I've discovered that the only thing worse than a badly sprained ankle is the crutches they give you.  I decided that the crutches hurt more than the ankle, so i'm going without today.  I'm thinking a tall black umbrella may serve well as a cane.  It's really hard to look cool and graceful while limping with a swollen ankle.    Once again I've proven that my saving grace is my utter clumsiness.  Diva out.

Better   Something about Autumn air makes me feel so good.  The air is sweeter, cooler, crisper.  And every breath I take in somehow loosens the binds around my heart.  I feel like I haven't taken a breath in months.  Maybe its the reduction in humidity.  Maybe there's some sort of sentimental value attached.  I don't know.  I just know that change is in the air, literally and it just makes me feel better.  Diva out.

So Much to say  and not much time to say it.  So, here's the highlights.  A crew of 4 or 5 men is now building an office space for me.  Knocked down walls yesterday, now their doing i-don't-know-what making all kinds of noise.  I may do an audio blog later just to share the clatter.  As for audio blog... paypal sent them another payment.  Apparently I had subscribed without knowing, so now I have another 3 months of audblogs to make.  will probably start with the construction noise.  My oldest diva is now involved in the morning announcements at school.  I guess you could call her the production director?  she keeps everyone in order and makes sure who ever is next is ready to go.  I told her to think big - today the morning announcements tomorrow Hollywood!  The littest diva is sick - at home with grandma today.  Had a fever of 104 on Monday morning, but of course the doctor doesn't find any infections to cause the fever.  This too will pass.  Aside from that, there's not much else going on.  Actually there's so much more going on than I have time to tell you about here.  Gotta go, busy busy.  Diva out.

Birthday Pampering  Is there anything better?  I decided on another thing that you should just pay for; pedicures.  I went on Saturday for a birthday pedi, and realized that I just don't do it like the pro's do.  There is really nothing like it, and I've made a birthday resolution to have a pedicure once a month.    Sunday I saw  La Traviatta  at Florida Grand Opera - another birthday pampering.  It was absolutely gorgeous - the costumes, the set, the music and the voices all combined to make my day very special.   I love opera, but how come the lady ALWAYS has to die at the end.  What is with that?  Struggle, suffer, try to live a proper life, make sacrifices for others... and die of some horrible disease or, even worse, by your own hand.  Makes a girl just want to go out and be bad!  My baby brother is in town this week for the holiday - baby brother is like 6'2' and football player big.  But he's still my baby brother.  Its nice to have someone around to play with my girls instead of just me for a change.  And, I'm just dying to tell you what else I did over the weekend, but propiety demands that I keep it clean.  Suffice it to say that I have an interesting new friend that sort of ensures that I will never die the death of an opera heroine *wink wink*.  Nuff said.  Diva out.
FTAA in my 'hood   Last night, while attempting to get home, I had to sit in about 20 minutes of stop and go traffic.  It took that long for me to travel one block.  All I needed to do was make a right and then go to the light 1/2 a block away and make a left, to go around the closed road leading into Downtown Miami.  20 minutes.  And in that 20 minutes I saw maybe 30 cops in riot gear, guns and all.  A little unsettling, but all was quiet on the homefront, so I figured the unsettling presence was getting the job done.  4 helicopters overhead and a whole fleet of cop cars wasn't hurting matters any either.  Today, I find this article on FTAA, and realize THIS is what was going on.  The article mentions an organization that marched into Downtown Miami last night - I drove past their empty bus parked a block from my building.  History is being made and it is pulpable - you can sort of feel it in the humid 80 degree air.  And I am sitting right in the thick of it, boys and girls.   At least for 20 minutes or so at a time...  Diva out.
It begins...  The official countdown has begun.  Today is officially 11 days till my BIRTHDAY :)  As part of the official celebratory month, I will be going to see 'La Traviata' on Sunday.  Perhaps stopping by the Clinique counter can be added to my agenda.  Let the celebrating commence!  Diva out.
I'm just a girl  Sometimes I forget that.  I had visions of grandeur this weekend as I walked through the aisles of the discount auto parts store.  I thought, 'I can do this!'  I wanted to save money so I figured I could put oil and coolant into my car, change the air and oil filters, and pick up a steering wheel cover while I'm at it.  When I could barely get the damn cover to stretch over my steering wheel, having to pry my finger from between the cover and the wheel, I should have known I was already beaten.  What the HELL was I thinking?  I ended up forgoing the oil filter when I learned that I would need a special tool.  I tried to figure out where the rectangular air filter went in my engine, but I just couldn't do it.  On my old 70-something Toyota hatchback there was a big round space indicating where to put the filter.  My 98 Nissan isn't quite so revealing.  And for my final act, I put 2 quarts of oil and an oil additive into my engine.  Harmless enough, right?  Well, add that to the oil already in my engine (running very low but still in there) and the 2 quarts I added last weekend, and - ladies and gentlemen - we have a recipe for DISASTER!  I cranked up my car, gripped the squeaky new steering wheel cover between my fingers, and proceeded out of the garage for a Saturday night on the town.  Then, I noticed a black plume of heavy smoke being belched out of my exhaust.  It was so bad that the maintenance guys in my building came running, they thought the building was on fire.  Fortunately, I was able to *have someone else* drain the excess oil out and after a few miles on the highway this morning, the leftover oil througout the entrails of my car burned away and by the time I got to work there was no more billowing smoke from my tailpipe.  So, what have I learned from this adventure (as I always learn something from everything).    1.  I'm just a girl.  No matter how much I believe I can do just about everything, I can't. 2.  I know just enough about cars to get myself into some really big trouble. 3.  The dipstick is there for a reason. 4.  I'm NEVER doing that again. From now on, I will pay for any and all work on my poor little car.    Diva out.
And for something different  I was making my way down the stairs this afternoon, and voila! I fell.  Again.  My slightly healed right ankle, which was really badly injured in my last fall, resulting in crutches, is now damaged all over again.  So, here I am, sitting at my desk starving since I haven't had lunch, with my ankle propped up on the garbage can waiting for someone to bring me ice.  My ankle is throbbing and swelling ever so slowly into a nice softball.  Again.  If nothing else, at least I'm consistent.  Diva out.
Danger Will Robinson!  FTAA is coming.  And if anything can be gleened from  urlLink this website  then I think I'm for it.  I really don't understand any of the reasons given on this page for why it should be stopped.  But, then, I'm not really a global thinker, I'm more concerned with paying the rent and changing the oil in my car.  And I'm concerned about protecting my family from angry protestors as they converge on downtown Miami next week.  The elementary school has called a mandatory meeting tonight for parents, to discuss possible safety issues.  Anyone with a badge - state troopers to Fish & Game - will be on hand to control any possible out of control crowds during the protesting.  Even the Port of Miami is taking no chances - the port is closed next week and all ships have to use a port further north.  The protestors' headquarters is less than 15 blocks from my house.    I don't really know what this is all about, but I do know I'm not excited about it coming to Miami.  Diva out.
Words I live by  Finally, someone has very clearly described exactly what I've been trying to explain to others for so very long.  Mostly I think the Dalai Lama is just a nice old man with scattered rambling thoughts - good, happy thoughts, but rambling.  This time, I must admit he's so very right.  'As long as there is a lack of the inner discipline that brings calmness of mind, no matter what external facilities or conditions you have, they will never give you the feeling of joy and happiness that you are seeking. On the other hand, if you possess this inner quality of calmness of mind, a degree of stability within, then even if you lack various external facilities that you would normally consider necessary for happiness, it is still possible to live a happy and joyful life.'  -His Holiness the Dalai Lama  Diva out.
Monday, Monday  Today started with the unparalleled joy of changing a flat tire.  I did it in less than 15 minutes, and managed to keep my clothes free of dirt and yuck.  And, luckily the tire was flat when I got into the car this morning.  It didn't go last night when I was driving home in the rain, or this morning when I would have been cruising along on the highway at 65 or 70.    So, while it was a bit of an inconvenience, it wasn't too bad.  Otherwise, I had a great weekend.  I participated in Hands on Miami Day and painted the boardwalk a new coat of brown.  Me and 299 other volunteers.  In all, the event attracted 3000 volunteers, with several projects throughout Miami and Miami Beach.  I even saw a few familiar faces, along with my team of 6 other coworkers.   Got a haircut, did a little shopping, and relaxed a little with a Sunday afternoon nap. Pics are going up in the diva gallery of our trick or treat outing.  In all, a pretty good weekend.     Diva out.
Expanding on the last entry, Food for thought   Eliz commented, 'According to my psychologist... it's a mental health problem that I have. *giggle... It's correctible -- assuming that I truly wish to change.  According to my psychiatrist... the truth lies within myself. She can have her opinion, BUT the truth of the matter depends on how I view it.'  Makes me wonder about psychologists and therapists.  I mean, are we all supposed to be perfectly adjusted and balanced?  Are we all supposed to be free of any preferences or predisposed natures?  If the Drs. all had their way, we'd all be free of addictions, fears, anxieties, attitudes, truths and denials.    But, aren't those the things we bring with us into the world at large, that define us and motivate us?  Aren't those the very things we came into this world to learn from and to teach others about?    Eliz, your psychologist is right about one thing; the truth does lie within you.  Within all of us, as I believe.  And I am still wondering about my own personal koan right now, but not fretting too much over it.  And if I went back to MY therapist, I already know what HER opinion would be!  Because we've been through this one before ;)  Diva out.
Food for thought  On another note, let me ask you, dear reader, for your opinion.    If something continues to present itself, a recurring habit or theme keeps returning, does that make it karma, destiny, or perhaps just a bad habit?  Example: You're no good at saving money.  You try and try: you open savings accounts, CDs, 401(k), etc etc.  But no matter what, you just don't save.  Or, you diet and exercise, but you just can't keep off the weight.  Or, no matter how hard you try to plan ahead, procrastination conquers all.  See what I mean? Nothing terribly bad, just some little habit that you've tried to break, a pattern in your life that you've tried to change, and it just keeps coming back.  Deja vu, over and over again.  So, I repeat the question: Is is karma, fate, destiny?  Or just a bad habit?  Is it the pattern and design of your life, something that should be aknowledged and accepted, or a flaw of character to be shunned and overcome?  What is your opinion, dear reader?  Of course I have my own curious scenario presenting itself right now, and I would appreciate your input.  So, use that little comment link for all its worth!  Diva out.
And what bothers me most of all is that my boss never ever gives me ANYTHING for Christmas.  He's a great guy, but he's really very insensitive when it comes to the holiday gift-giving thing.  A hug and a happy holidays, and he's out the door.  That really gets me most of all.
HoLiDaY uPs AnD dOwNs   Yeah, I'm still in a bit of a funk over the whole holiday thing.  It's very unlike me, which only means that it won't last.  I was reminded in reading last night to 'live in the moment.'  To breathe in, and then out, and to live in the space between each breath.  If you can let go of the exhale, and not anticipate the inhale, then you are living in the moment.  It was a good reminder, and it's helping me today.  That, and the good news of an old friend who is visiting for the holidays.  We're going to do a little holiday shopping in Downtown Miami tomorrow - you know, guerilla-warfare shopping for Christmas Eve.  Everything you need is Downtown.  So, I have the day off tomorrow to take care of the myriad tasks ahead of me, and I will spend a few hours with a very dear friend.  I have something to look forward to, and that makes me happy.  Even without the breathing.    Diva out.
Let the festivities begin  I went to my Employee Holiday Party last night, and danced my ass off.  Everyone commented, both last night and this morning, on how much I danced.  I love to dance.  In fact, I danced so much that now my kneecaps hurt.   What the hell is that about?   Any way, in case you're interested, you can check out pics  urlLink here .  It was the first party we'd had in two years, and we sure did make up for lost time.  I left at midnight, but as I was leaving the conference services manager had just convinced the DJ to play longer.  I have no idea when that party ended, but when I left it was no where near winding down.  What a great night!    And, that stupid effing bond payment has finally been sent to the disbursement unit to be released to me as payment for outstanding child support.  DBD was picked up the first weekend in August; I may actually get his bail bond just before Christmas.  I think I see shopping in my near future.    Fa-la-la-la-la, La-la-la-laaaaaaaaaa  Diva out.
Something new  I've never had this reaction before, and it has really left me feeling very disturbed and upset.  I was sitting at lunch just now, minding my own business.  Suddenly a santa hat was thrust upon me, and an order to say something holiday-ish into the video cam for the staff party.  I was caught very unawares, and very unprepared.  And, I'm really not feeling it.  I joked, telling them I'll just 'say 'Bah humbug', because I'm just not feeling it.'    My co-worked improvised a very merry holiday greeting into the camera lens, and then all eyes were on me to perform likewise.  I couldn't.  I told them to get me later, because I wasn't ready.  Then I had to get up and leave the cafeteria.  I was too upset to stay.  I knew I wasn't in the mood, but I didn't realize how NOT in the mood I am.  It's a week away, and then it will be all over.  Soon, this will all be over.  Diva out.
An interesting note: when I click on the referrer's google search down there, looking for Downtown Diva, the very first link listed is Downtown Diva, Pimps.  Hmmm.  I do my holiday shopping one way, others have their own methods.  *grin*
and PS - welcome to my newest reader Justin.  Thanks for the comments ~ I love comments!
Diva is back  I've actually managed to get caught up on my workload here in the office.  *sssshh, don't tell my boss!* So, I can give you, my dearest reader, a little update on the weekend.  A friend from NY left the artic north for a little frolicking in the balmy Miami sunshine.  I am so glad when we can spend time together, he's the only other person I know who likes to just walk around and check things out. (Besides my brother, that is).  We strolled along Ocean Drive and Washington Ave, Lincoln Road and all across Downtown Miami - in just one afternoon!    Went to see The Last Samurai, and despite the vivid battle scenes - I hate blood, guts and violence - I really loved it.  It was so visually beautiful and so emotionally stirring.  Sometimes, the actors didn't have to say anything, the looks and actions expressed all that was intended.  And, as my friend pointed out, they didn't have Japanese villagers speaking English to each other.  They spoke Japanese, with English subtitles.  After all, why would they speak English to EACH OTHER?  It was well done, and I am really glad I got to see it.    OK, off my movie review soapbox.   As for the Holiday looming in the not-far-enough future, I say 'BAH HUMBUG!'  I have to fix my car's CV Joint and replace a rear tire - my third flat tire in less than 3 months - and I haven't  even started  my shopping.  Then there's all those holiday cards that are being received here at the hotel which just makes for more mail for me to open.  More work for me, delaying me from updating my blog.  And don't even get me started on the whole tree thing.  If I buy a real one *uh-oh.  I've started myself on this* If I buy a real tree, I'll have to haul the thing down to the dumpster in about 10 days, thereby wastefully disposing of a natural resource.  And the money spent on buying a tree could otherwise be spent on presents - assuming I ever get to buy any.  If I buy a fake tree, I'll have to hoard the damn thing in a closet for a year, again using money and taking up valuable space in an already crowded closet.     urlLink I'm thinking bamboo tree again this year.    Although, I am beginning to have the holiday spirit.  I'm hosting a Wine Club 'Holiday Sparkle' event tomorrow night - featuring champagnes ~ ooo la la - and on Thursday I have the hotel's holiday party to attend.   Trust me, no one parties like hotel people, so it should be a really good party.  Then Friday, my little diva will be performing in a holiday show.    Besides that, carols keep playing in my head against my will and my own better judgement.  So, you know, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  *ha ha now that damn song will be playing in YOUR head too!*  Your welcome.  Diva out.
It is written...  According to  urlLink this  I'm going to live until January 2050, when I will die at the age of 84.  Can someone mark their Outlook calendar for me, and check back later?   Thanks to Candy for this  fun  link.  Diva out.
Voracious  Reader, that is.  Well, that and other things... *wink, wink*  I mentioned to a friend yesterday that I would like to borrow his copy of Hilary Clinton's 'Living History' just as soon as I finish the three books I'm currenlty reading.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  'Three books?  You're reading three books?'  Yeah. I'm reading three books.  Actually, I've only started two of them. As I am almost finished with the one I started on Saturday, I'll probably move further along in my second one, and pick up the third one sometime soon.  I can't help it.  I don't watch TV, I read.  And if you're not new to my blog, you probably understand that I cover a wide genre of literature - but mostly I just read dead people.  Classic literature and philosophy.  So, I'm reading about the paradox of sex and spirituality (which has actually interested me in a few other authors like Henry Miller and Walt Whitman) and I'm reading Jane Eyre, which I bought on my summer road trip but just haven't thought to read yet.  Next is the Accident Buddhist - which I'm figuring will be my life story! - and then I'll borrow Hilary's book.    Oh, but wait.  She's not dead.   Can I read that?  Yeah, for Hilary I can break a rule or two, heh heh.  Diva out.
urlLink Your Diva turned 34 on Sunday!    I always thought 33 would be an amazing year.  A year of enlightenment.  When I turned 33, I figured, 'Ok.  Jesus and Buddha both discovered their true natures, found themselves if you will, at 33, right?'  (Right?)   And if they can do it, so can I; hopefully without an actual crucifixion or ascension.  No blood or anything, just enlightenment.  A little pain will be okay, but not too much, thank you very much.  And I was right.  What a year it has been.  Joy and pain.  I've discovered much about myself while I was 33, and much of it ended up on this blog.  And I think I'm better for it.  Thanks to all of my blog readers who keep coming back for more *god only knows why you do*.  34, here we come! :)  Diva out.
urlLink How many days till Christmas?   Thanks for sharing this one Deb!  Diva out.
Screw up bird   Apparently, yesterday was my day to be that screw up bird making the left instead of the right. *groan*  Although I've been milling it all over in my head, fearing retribution, and convincing myself that I can live quite comfortably on unemployment, a few random acts of kindness today are helping to remind me that it's all my own perception.   My screw ups and fears are so big because they're all in my head.  Nobody else seems to be carrying around yesterday's drama but me.    So, I'm going to shake it off and move on.  Friends can be so good to you without even knowing it.  Diva out.
Post Script on Pondering   My mind just got scarier.  Now, along with all the other things I have the Ron Stoppable 'Naked Mole Rap' buzzing in my head.     Nah-nah-nah-nah Listen to the Naked Mole Rap!   Thanks, Radio Disney.  Diva out.
Things I ponder   First of all, I discovered a 'hidden racism' yesterday.    I'm catergorized as Caucasian.  My children are considered Hispanic.  Simply because I had the audacity to mix my Euro-American blood with *gasp* someone with a Latin American heritage, our children are now considered Hispanic.  Why not Caucasian?  Why not Hispanic/Causcasion, or, alphabetically, Caucasian/Hispanic?  It's the 'man' trying to keep my girls down!  Another, completely unrelated, pondering:  ever watch a flock of birds fly in circles together?  They fly to and fro, from one corner of the sky to another, in total unison, and then back to the first space, and around again.  How do they know when to turn, which way to turn?     And, is there ever a poor little screw-up bird that keeps going left when he's supposed to be going right?  Things that make you go, 'Hmmmmm.'   (I know, it's pretty scary being in my head, isn't it?!)  Diva out.
I've seen these kind words on more than one blog today... a few words of advice from  urlLink The Good Doctor .
Smile   urlLink I can't decide if this is really cute or just plain annoying.   Maybe somewhere in between.  Diva out.
And a sad farewell to  urlLink Captain Kangaroo .
Done  I filed my taxes today.  Yes, that's right.  I filed my taxes today.  My 2003 taxes are filed and I should have my refund in my bank account in a week or two.  It's like magic.  I love e-file.   So, while the rest of you are still fumbling through drawers for receipts and what-not, I'll be spending my refund.  Mostly on bills, of course, and that still-needed car repair; but I do have my eye on one of those DVD/VCR combo deals.  Our VCR died a few weeks ago, and I think I'm going to splurge a little.  I feel pretty darn good.  Diva out.
In the 'tweens   Any parent who's ever lived through a child being the ages of 10 to 12 know exactly what I'm getting at here.  My oldest little diva is 10.  She will be 11 in March.  She's what marketers call a 'tween' - not a child, not a teen.  And with her coveted marketing demographic come many little quirks.    One of these quirks is that, in public spaces, I am now 'Mom'.  The first time she called me by that moniker, I didn't realize it was my own child calling for her mother.  I'm not 'Mom', I'm 'Mommy'.  So, I didn't bother to look up.  Then, I realized it was her voice calling, so I responded with a small amount of discord.  It just didn't feel right.    Now I've grown more accustomed to this grown-up public version of my daughter.  To me, it indicates a small amount of embarassment to her to cling to childhood things.  Things like good-bye kisses, hello hugs and needing her 'Mommy'.  But last night as I walked her, half-asleep, from my bed to hers, she mumbled a sweet, 'Good night, Mommy,' and all was right in the world again.  In the safety of her own home, without the danger of 'tween' on-lookers, I am still 'Mommy'.  Diva out.
Right under my nose  You know how you can spend days, or even weeks, looking for something?  Then, you find it right in front of you?  I had one of those experiences.  I have been looking all over the place - online searching, magazine listings, related websites - trying to find somewhere to learn meditation ~ Tibetan Buddhist Meditation (this is where anyone who knows me for any length of time starts to freak out).  I searched high and low for a place to meditate, to learn how to really do it right.  I've been looking now for more than 2 weeks, and everywhere I turned, there was either a disconnected phone number or a dead e-mail address.  Apparently, Buddhists don't cling to communication ;)  I knew that the pastor at my church offered a meditation session on Monday nights, and I finally had a chance to check that out this Monday.  No school, no kids to pick up after work.  So, I went.  To my methodist church with my female pastor leading the sesshin, I had my very first guided Tibetan Buddhist mindfulness mediation.  It was all I had been looking for - and it was right there in front of me every Sunday on the church program.  Under my nose, literally.  Funny how things work out.  Diva out.
munday  although not quite such a monday, since today is a holiday.  MLK day may not be everyone's holiday, but it does quiet the phones and ease up on the e-mail.  i was able to get a lot done, so in addition to all he's already done, 'thanks, Dr. King!'  had a faaaabulous south beach weekend.  this was the annual art deco weekend - an art festival featuring lots of art deco period art, furniture, posters, jewelry and other miscellaneous things.  and, for the first time in a long time, street performers were legally able to entertain the throngs.  i must admit it did add to the flavor of the event.  i even saw the 'naked cowboy' - i think it was THE naked cowboy, from NY.  Sure looked like the pictures i've seen.  i'm thinking the single digit weather up there may have chased him down here.  its gotta be tough picking a guitar in your skivvies with a negative degree wind chill!  also saw the movie cheaper by the dozen - very cute.  no matter how many kids you have, they will love it, and so will you.    also checked out the new  urlLink Miami Childrens Museum .  not a bad way to spend a stormy sunday afternoon.  kept the kids entertained for a good 3 hours, and we could have stayed longer if the grown ups in the group didn't have other things to do.  in all, it was a very good two days.  quality time with the diva-ettes was much needed.  hope my reader had a great two days too!  diva out.
work  Yo Yo Ma was here yesterday. Sandra Bernhardt is here today.  This is one cool hotel, damnit!  Diva out.
You know what's weird is that I normally get the 'Fool' card on these readings.  I don't know why its changed to Empress.  Fool really suits me more, I think.  Diva out.
I am The Empress    The Empress can refer to any aspect of Motherhood. She can be an individual mother, but as a major arcana card, she also goes beyond the specifics of mothering to its essence - the creation of life and its sustenance through loving care and attention. The Empress can also represent lavish abundance of all kinds. She offers a cornucopia of delights, especially those of the senses - food, pleasure and beauty. She can suggest material reward, but only with the understanding that riches go with a generous and open spirit. The Empress asks you to embrace the principle of life and enjoy its bountiful goodness.  For a full description of your card and other goodies, please visit  urlLink LearnTarot.com         What tarot card are you?  Enter your birthdate.  Month:   Day:   Year:          I 'borrowed' this from  urlLink Steph , who 'snitched from Asherah & various other blogs but the links don't seem to be working correctly so try heading to http://www.obeythefist.com/tarot/ and entering your birthdate there.'  It worked pretty well for me.  Diva out.
Finally a list I can relate to!   YOU MIGHT BE IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY IF . . . .   1. You sat at the same desk for 4 years and worked for 8 different managers.   2. 'Going for cocktails and dinner' is NOT your idea of a nice evening.   3. When someone asks you your exact job profile, you lie.   4. You get really excited about a 2% pay increase.   5. You sit in a cubicle smaller than your bedroom closet.   6. It's dark on your drive to and from work.   7. Communication is something your 'group' is having problems with.   8. You see a good-looking person and know it's a visitor/guest.   9. Food left over from a banquet / meeting is your main staple.   10. You forget what you look like in anything but a suit.   11. All the work you were hired to do gets done before 9 and after 5..   12. You're already late on the assignment you just received.   13. You boss's favorite lines are . . .  a. 'When you get a few minutes . . . .'  b. 'In your spare time ...... '  c. 'I have an opportunity for you . . . .'   14. 50% of the people in your company do not know what you do   15. The other 50% of the people in your company do not care what you do   16. Vacation is something you roll-over to next year or a check you get every January.   17. Change is the norm.   18. Nepotism is encouraged.   19. You read this entire list and understand it.  Diva out.
Resolutions  I finally came up with a few resolutions for the new year.  Took me while.  And no, giving up on procrastinating isn't one of them!  I've decided to start painting again.  To honor my creative spirit, as it were.  Surprisingly, my oldest little diva was very pleased with this decision.    I'm sure I had others, but I really can't remember them right now.  Another was to get my weight down another 3lbs and keep it there a while.  What was that other one?  I'm having a Dory moment right now, so I'll have to add it in later.  I've heard that if you share a goal with others, you're more likely to keep it.  So, consider yourself as 'others'.  Diva out.
and, by the way, I have NO IDEA why everything below is in bold.  I've checked the code, and it's right (as far as I can tell).    Sorry if you find it as annoying as I do.
Tomorrow's Pay Day  BIG BIG sigh of relief. Tomorrow's pay day.  Right now, I'm so broke I can't even pay attention - ba-dum-bump-CH!  And I called the State Disbursement unit about that effing bond payment that's been sitting in the state's account since 12/18.  Apparently, the revenue department needed a little nudge from me.  Now things should move along smoothly enough.  I may get my hands on that $$ before the end of this month. *maybe*   Didn't I have to do that the LAST time I was expecting money from the state?  *sigh*    Anyway, tomorrow's payday.  And, did I mention, tomorrow's pay day?  Diva out.
urlLink A Day in the Life    After having reviewed all 87 entries - yes all 87 - for the Day in the Life New Year's Eve project, I can honestly say that, compared to many other recorded celebrations from around the world, mine didn't suck.    Some were so boring, there weren't even 24 pics to be had.  At least I had something to take pictures of.  And I had to edit them down to one per hour.  Lots of people went to dinner parties at friends' houses - I'm thinking that might be a nice change for next year's festivities.    Lots of people had lots of fun and lots of alcohol.  In all, I think it was a very successful evening, collectively. ;)  Happy New Year again, everyone!  Diva out.
Life is good    I had this whole other entry thought up on how great our new 'Dora the Explorer' alarm clock is, but something just happened that merits entry.  I had resigned myself to the fact that I would need to borrow $10 for gas today.  I managed to scrounge up $2 in change last night, but decided that it just wouldn't be enough.  Now I am on 'E' just waiting for that little idiot light to come on.    So, I was just waiting for a friend to come in so I could ask him to borrow the money.  Then I get a call from our Concierge Desk, telling me that a guest needs a document notarized.  The charge for this task is exactly $10.  :)  Now I don't need to borrow money (something I really hate to do) as I have earned it instead.  Life is good and the Universe never ceases to amaze me in its gifts.  There's another gift I am hoping to receive very soon, but I'm afraid to write about it just now.  When it happens, you'll be the first to know.    The universe has a crappy sense of humor.  The guy stiffed me on the notary fee. He checked out and never came back to pay me.  Creep.  Diva out.
Feeling Much Better    the holidays have passed, and life is back to normal.  Kids are in school and everyone is back in the office. *BIG sigh of relief*  and, as i have had to wait 5 months for that bail bond payment from waaaaay back in August, and am still waiting, i have come to realize something.  i have allotted that money to everything from rent, to long overdue bills, to paying back debts to friends that lent me money, to buying christmas presents.  oh, and repairing my car.  in the meantime, some of those bills have somehow been paid without receiving that money.  christmas gifts were bought.  well, the car still needs repairing.  but i'm still waiting.  now the circus is coming and i want to take my girls, and the car still needs repairing.  there are so many new ways to spend that money, and yet, somehow, even without the money i've managed to keep moving.    i can't help but see the lesson in all of this.  although i would have preferred to have had a check instead of a lesson, my own nature finds yet another way to be grateful for what i haven't got (yet).  Diva out.
A day in the life  Happy New Year Everyone!    I had so much fun yesterday with the little project over at Sh1ft.org, the 'Day in the Life' Project!  I took one photo every hour (or so), and had a great time recording the last few hours of 2003 and the first few hours of 2004.  I'm pretty pleased with the results, and can't wait to see all of the entries.  You can see my results  urlLink here .  Hope everyone had a very happy holiday - and best wishes for all of us for a better, more peaceful 2004.  Diva out.
Happy Friday!  A little Friday fun...    You are Woodstock!    urlLink   Which Peanuts Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    First I was a cricket, now I'm a little yellow bird.    Diva out.
Thank You Miss Jackson!  If nothing else comes from the Super Bowl stunt, at least  urlLink THIS  did.   I never liked him; maybe you did, but I never did.  Zero Tolerance can be a good thing. ;)   More fallout from the fall-out, Justin Timberlake was pulled as the co-host for a MoTown Records Award Show, too... leaving Smokey Robinson with hope of more than a soda commercial on the horizon.  Diva out.
Rizzn's fault  I checked  urlLink rizzn's page , and his protest on another blog's comments on the whole gay marriage thing got me thinking (damn him).  I heard a comment on NPR last night, where Bush said something about history proving that marriage between a man and woman is best (or something like that).  I tried to find the quote online today, to be all professional and correct and stuff, but I figured I'd just forge on ahead without it.  Everytime I hear that man speak, I think to myself, 'What the hell is he thinking?'  On the surface, he seems to share the same ideas, thoughts and beliefs of the common 'good american'.  You know, the right wing, republican, christian upbringing, tons on money in the bank common american.  Unfortunately, I don't think he goes any deeper than the surface.  I also don't think he goes any further than the imaginary borders of this country.    I wonder what impact these 4 years will have on the next 20, the next 50, the next 200.  In my great grandchildren's history books, will he be a Truman, or a Nixon?  Will there be another 4 years of him?  Does he ever wonder this too?  His actions and thoughts impact everyone, presently and years into the future.  With any luck, the issues brought forward in his presidency - family, health, money, religion, war - will inspire future leaders to move ahead with less personal agendas.  It is good to talk about what he has brought into the limelight.  It is good to debate over what works and doesn't work.    The critical thinking being done now about so many issues will, in the end, have some impact on how we think, act, plan, marry, spend, work, live.    Then I wonder, did the Romans, the Greeks, the Aztecs do it any better than we are right now?  Diva out.
It's that time again!  Time again for me to shamelessly solicit all of my wonderful, generous, charming, fabulous readers.    I will be doing the walk again - the AIDS Walk Miami.  And I've set my goal high this year - hoping to raise at least $100.   So, pull out your plastic and support your diva today.  Make a donation at my own personal webpage for the Walk  urlLink here .  If you're not ready to donate just yet, that's ok.  I'm going to leave that link up over there to the right for quite a while.  Thanks for your support.  Diva out.
Diva in training  In true diva spirit, I took my oldest little diva to her very first Opera on Friday night.   It was 'Romeo et Juliette', performed in French by the  urlLink Florida Grand Opera .    This was an early birthday present for her, as she turns 11 next month.  I was a little concerned that, being only 10, she may get a little bored.   After all, this is a long one, at 3 hours and 15 minutes - with 2 intermissions.  She donned a new outfit - black skirt, white blouse with sparkly brooch; she did up her hair, put on a little lip gloss and selected an evening bag.  Topped off with my black wrap, she looked as if she'd always gone to the Opera.  She sat perched on the edge of her seat for many scenes, my opera glasses at the end of nose, peering alternately at the stage and the English translations.  I was so proud of her, and so glad that I was able to expose her to something that I think is just wonderful.  She agreed with me; it is something wonderful and she said she really liked it.   She's already selected at least two operas from next season that she would like to see.  Ah, my little diva is growing up.  Diva out.
My dream guy  Ok, maybe he's gay or married or out of my league.  Doesn't mean I can't admire him anyway.   urlLink Dedication, determination and passion  are what make him so appealing to me.  Maybe I should start hitting some co-ed yoga classes OFF of South Beach.  *sigh*  I'm thinking a yoga retreat in Boston may be in order for the summer time.  Diva out.
About my yoga  Some weeks back, someone visited my site and requested that I blog about my yoga practice.  Not sure why, and when I said I would blog about my practice, I never really was sure that I would.    But, lately my practice has increased and, combined with my meditation practice, I am beginning to see some changes in how I do what I do ~ at least in yoga anyway.  I've started getting up earlier, like around 6:30 (without an alarm clock - does this mean I'm getting older?); I'm up with the sun for some strange reason.  Sometimes I just roll over and snooze for another hour, but more often I am getting up and rolling out my yoga mat.  The mornings are harder for me than the evenings.  I'm stiff and sore and weak and hungry.  But by the third or fourth sun salutation, I'm better.  I only get through the standing half of the asthanga practice - normally about 20 or 30 minutes worth.  Then I'm primed and ready for the day, with a bit more energy and optimism than expected.  Evenings are better for me.  I can really get deep into the practice when the girls are asleep.  I can hear my breathing and feel the muscles stretching, feel the vibrations that come when I'm in certain positions.  And, now with meditation added to the practice, I realize even more that yoga is a moving meditation.  Sitting with my eyes closed or staring out into space, my body remembers what movement is like.  Moving through an asana, my mind remembers what spaciousness is.    It is strange, and maybe I'm the only one who will ever understand this entry.  But, I was asked to write about it, and its part of my experience.  And, let's face it ~ this  is   my  blog.  Diva out.
Keepin' it real  V-Day seems to not be a total disappointment.  Since I am in the office today working on resaurant menus, I got invited to the Valentines Dinner by the F&B Director.  A friend and I will be dining for free on lobster tail and tenderloin.  Not bad, even if my date will be just a female friend of mine.  And, they say good friends help to keep you real.  At least, somebody said it, because I know I've heard it before.  Last night I got together with a few friends from high school; some I hadn't seen in years, some I see (or at least read) pretty regularly.  I think I must have changed quite a lot in the past  *&^%$ years.  We were reminisicing over high school antics, what they did and how I would stand over their shoulder telling them why they shouldn't.    I was their 'Jiminy Cricket', their conscience.    And, I never wanted to drive on the interstate in my little white hyundai.  I'm wondering, was I annoying?  Was I so meek and mild mannered that I was afraid to have fun?  And, more importantly, WHY DON'T I REMEMBER BEING LIKE THAT?   I don't remember playing the conscience to all of my friends.  I don't remember doing half of what they say I did.  I did get into the same mischief my friends did, 'guilty by association' as someone put it last night.  I remember having fun and doing silly things (much of it I really can't discuss here, to protect the innocent).  heh-heh.  I don't know why I don't remember being who they said I was.  They made me sound like, I don't know, a nag, a conscience, a party-pooper... 'you really shouldn't do that, its not very nice.'    But, they let me play with them anyway.  They let me hang out, even when I didn't drink their liquid lunches with them, and I didn't shoot m&m's at passers-by in the hallways, and I  swear  i do not recall EVER throwing citrus at pedestrians, or plucking them from a tree.  Although, maybe I do have a slight recollection of picking fruit late at night...    Anyway, for whatever reasons my friends allowed me to be their friends, I am grateful.  Grateful for teaching me freedom to be myself, and freedom to just cut loose once in awhile.  Last night was a gift for Fred, but I reaped some of those rewards as well.  Diva out.
Couldn't have said it better myself   'You are more.  Even the most intense experience is only an experience you are having. It is not you, and you are not it.  You are more than your problems, more than your possessions, more than the pains and pleasures. You are more than the frustrations that sometimes feel so overwhelming.  Too often, out of fear, you cling tightly to things that don't really matter. Imagine the freedom that can come from letting go and stepping back.  What if your most agonizing worries no longer had the power to worry you? What if your most burdensome difficulties no longer had the power to trouble you?  Step back from them, and it is all possible. It's not a matter of running away, but of putting the world in perspective.  The real person you are, is not defined or limited by the passing circumstances, no matter how intense they may be. Always remember that you are more.'  -- Ralph Marston  Diva out.
Happy Birthday, Mr. President    And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.  -  Abraham Lincoln  Yeah, I have a thing for tall, wiry, overwhelmingly compassionate men.  I'd sing to him in a dress - of course, considering his era, it would be much less revealing and I somehow imagine it would be thick and scratchy.  But, you know, when you got a thing for men who do great things, you'll go pretty far.  Diva out.
Timing is everything  I have my share of good days and bad days.  But for 2 days in a row, I've managed to be in the right place at the right time.    Right around 11am, they pull the breakfast buffet from the restaurant. Warm chafing dishes half-filled with crispy, savory hour-old bacon and grease-filled crispy-on-the-outside, juicy-on-the-inside fat little sausages.  Left overs from what has been picked over since 6:30 this morning by hotel guests with more time and money on their hands than they know what to do with.    My cholesterol has probably spiked high from my recent good fortune; but, man! how a little bacon and sausage can make the day go oh-so good.  Diva out.
Once again, I say,  urlLink Talk to your child!   Diva out.
Ooo-La-La  My friend, and the hotel's new Executive Chef, was recently featured in  urlLink The Miami Herald .  One of the best reviews we've had in a long time.  It's nice to get a good word every now and then.  Diva out.
2 tragedies in 2 days in Florida  After seeing the news this morning, I realize that I need to sit my girls down and have a serious talk tonight.  Everyone probably knows by now about the missing 11 year old girl in Sarasota.  Luckily, they have the abduction on tape somehow, so they know who did it.   Sadly, the abductor isn't being very cooperative, so the girl is still missing.   Something you may not have heard about is the murder of a 14 year old boy by classmate in a South Florida school.  One 14 year old boy cut the throat of another 14 year old boy in the school bathroom early Tuesday morning.  While the boy has admitted to the crime, the motive has not yet been established.  These are the things parents dread and fear.  Horrific stories of brutality that you wouldn't bare to hear happening to an adult, much less a child.  And we all think we are impervious to such assaults.   That could never happen to my child.  My child is too smart for that to happen to him/her.   * Tell your child to never go near or into a stranger's car.   * Tell your child to scream, yell, blow a whistle, make as much noise as possible.  Even if the stranger threatens to hurt them if they make noise - be as loud as they can. * Even if the stranger has a gun, run away.  Either the person won't bother to shoot, or if they do shoot, and by some luck actually hit you, you're still better off bleeding in public where someone can help you. * Grab onto something bigger than you and don't let go for anything.  If you're holding onto your bike, a big stick, a telephone pole, whatever, you won't fit into the person's car. *Don't try to help an adult who is a stranger.  You can find an adult you know to help the stranger, but don't do it by yourself. * 911 is a free call.  As soon as you get away, dial it.  The cops will find you no matter where you are as long as you stay by that payphone.  And for school, these rules may have to apply to other students unfortunately.  Its hard to know if your child is being bullied at school.  But, you have to talk about it.  It's the only way to really know what's going on there.  They spend anywhere from 5 to 8 hours there every weekday, and you really need to know what's happening to your child.  These are the things I'm going to tell my very smart daughters tonight.   And then I'm going to hug them very very tightly.  Diva out.
Soapbox   **Diva unassumingly places her soapbox in the middle of blogdom, then quietly steps up onto her little soapbox.  She opens her mouth to speak.**   Here's my two cents on the whole Janet Jackson boob thing.    At any given time on any given day and on any given channel on TV ('cept maybe Disney  *she mumbles with uncertainty *) you can find women being beaten, pushed, pulled, dragged and raped - with all sorts of body parts showing.  Why is it that, when a woman chooses to show off a part of her own on her own, the networks go crazy?   What, you think your 7 year old isn't watching MTV?  Ever caught an hour or two of Sunday afternoon TNT?    And, apparently the US is the only country bothered by the whole thing.  BBC and other world networks never even bothered to cut away from the incident.  It was the Puritan Americans, with all their family values, that shut their viewers eyes to the shame of a woman's body.  A woman's body that wasn't being manipulated and controlled by their programming.   **Diva lets forth a heavy sigh, then respectfully steps down from her soapbox.  Quietly picks up said soapbox wondering what comments this will evoke, and shuffles away, out of view (and hopefully out of range).**   Diva out.
Tangled Mind  First of all, it was intentional.  I don't buy for one second that the costume malfunctioned.  Janet's a freak, period, end of statement.  Now that that's out of the way...  Realization Number 1: While walking through the sun-drenched streets of South Beach on my lunch break, just barely breaking a sweat in the balmy 68 degrees (are you jealous yet?), I realized that no matter how tough life can be, I always carry a little bit of joy in me.  Realization Number 2: The art to a sexy walk is never looking like you're in a hurry.  You may very well be in a hurry, but your walk should not indicate this.  As long as, with every step, you feel the stride and enjoy the sound of your heel on the pavement, and move into the next long stride, you will be sexy.  Damnit.   Realization Number 3: Weird, misguided thought number 1: While making my way back from my lunch break walk, a man on the street sneezed really loud.  REALLY LOUD.  Echoing through the streets and alleys loud.  Everyone stopped in their tracks to look.  He moved on, and then sneezed again a moment later.  Twisted thought crossed my mind: Is he that loud in bed?  Then my mind meandered to last night, when I heard my neighbors from what must have been a kitchen romp.  Deep throaty moans with an even amount of time between each of them.  At the time, I just wanted to get my little diva into our apartment so I wouldn't have to explain the sounds coming from behind the other door.  But, today my mind wandered back to the sounds.  Such nice sounds.    Maybe they were listening to a Janet Jackson CD after having watched the game.  Diva out.
More Diva for your Dollar   Despite my fabulous pseudonym and glamorous locale, it may surprise you, dear reader, to learn that Im not actually all that much of a diva.  I mean, I do get to a salon more than some single moms, and I definitely take very good care of myself.  But, in all, Im more of a regular girl a simple girl with simple needs.  In fact, I havent really done much shopping in a very long time. Of course, with the new influx of child support dollars, Ive been able to get out a little more to get the things all three divas in my household require.  Ive gone a little crazy  new towels, shoes for my diva-ettes, even a new set of pjs for the little one.  I know, I know; out of control.  And I have managed to acquire a little slice of heaven in the form of a Victorias Secret credit card.  Man-oh-man could a diva get herself into trouble with this one!  I made a little visit to my local VS store on Saturday.  At first, after not shopping for so long, I was a little ambivalent.  The store was buzzing with young hotties and their bashful boyfriends, as well as a few almost middle-aged mothers, dragging their children along behind them.  And there was me.    Did you know that they have a lady in the dressing room to measure you????  Did you know that all the salespeople walk around with headsets, chatting back and forth to each other: Hi sweetie, can you get me a 34D, black?  Are you free to assist?    What is with that?  How urgent can it be?  I almost felt guilty for NOT letting someone help me pick out just the right bra.  Sheesh.  But it was quite an experience, and a very nice one at that.  And, I am now the proud diva owner of 2!, yes 2! New VS bras.  I have cleavage  who knew.  Now more diva than ever.  Diva out.
I (heart) Yoga   I was able to go to a yoga class last night for the first time in more than a year.  Ive been practicing at home, but, well you know.  I get in 30 or 40 minutes of practice, and then call it a night.  And, as hard as I may try to correct my posture and get deeper into a pose its just me.    Like trying to learn how to drive a car by reading an owners manual.  Without the practice and a good teacher, you can only get so far.  Last night, I had the teacher and I had the class around me.  The teacher checked my posture and helped me to get a little deeper into my down dog.  He reminded me to be mindful of my movements, my thoughts and my breathing.  Seeing the other class members working so hard inspired me to get through the class, to do that last Sun Salutation B (I usually only do 1 or 2).  Seeing the others work past their own abilities, stretching themselves into unfamiliar postures, encouraged me to go even deeper into the ones I know so well.  And I did a few arm balances that Ive never done before.  Eventually, after headstand, the teacher had to encourage me to rest, as I had been working like a dog  his words.  My effort was evident, and even I was surprised at having made it to the end of the class without giving up.  Of course, I had a hard time holding on to my steering wheel while driving home.  My body ached all night (and still does) with the effort of getting through that class.  But, in addition to the ache, I feel a strong sense of accomplishment and strength.  I feel that Ive opened up some parts of my body that had closed up again after so long without a class.    And I am reminded once again why I love yoga so much; I am constantly amazed at how I keep proving myself wrong  I can do this.  I can make it.  I am stronger than I will ever believe I am.  Yoga pushes me further and proves to me my limitless abilities even as my doubting mind tries to deny it all.    We are all stronger than we know.  Diva out.
Gorgeous Spring Weather  It may still be winter up north, with temperatures low enough to make snow, but here the weather is just gorgeous.  There's nothing like a blustery Spring morning in Miami to bring a smile to my face.  69 degrees this morning, with a strong, cool breeze blowing through me.  I couldn't help but smile.  I love the feeling of the wind on my skin.  Now, if it would just rain.  With all the wind, my car is covered with sand and oceanspray.  I don't wash my car, I just wait for a good rain.  But, of course we all know, it never rains until you wash your car.  See my dilemma?  Diva out.
Random bits & pieces  First off, I think I may have figured out a way to fit yoga AND meditation into my daily schedule.  I've been working in one or the other for the past few weeks, and my yoga is really suffering.  Last night, I managed to do both before bedtime, and it felt great.  So, I'm putting both on my daily agenda; now if only my little diva-ettes will cooperate by going to bed on time...  I took my now 11 year old diva-ette, along with 5 other 10-11 year old girls, to see Hidalgo on Saturday night.  No, it wasn't penance for my sins, it was a birthday party for my daughter.  It was a lot of fun actually, and I really enjoyed the movie on many levels.  There were some subliminal messages that I got from it, like comparing the 'Arabians' to the American Indians, and the lack of knowledge about the culture creating hatred for that culture.  And, finding yourself, being true to yourself... so many levels to appreciate.  The girls liked the horses. :p  And, they've installed monitoring software on the internet here at work, so that may mean fewer installations.  I know... I know... you're wondering how will you ever live  without your diva.  But, have no fear, dear reader.  I'm working on getting internet at home (which will probably end up being monopolized by the above-mentioned 11 year old).  So, when I should be doing my down-dogs, I may end up blogging instead.  And, one last note; I saw two things downtown on Saturday morning that I've never seen before.  Not counting the new farmer's market, I saw several 'Help Wanted' signs in shop windows, and I saw an overhead construction walkway, encompassing one whole street corner.  To me, these are indicators of growth in the area.  Downtown hasn't seen growth in many many years.  It was just a place to get the occasional bargain, but never considered a serious business/shopping/entertainment area.  With new businesses, growth in current businesses, new construction of housing; Downtown is fast becoming a really great place to live.  Diva out.
Keeping things in perspective  Next time you open your electric bill and growl about how high it is, here's a little something to make you feel better.  The electric bill here at my hotel runs on average $17,000 PER MONTH.  Now, don't you feel better?  Diva out.
American Diva  I was watching that Idol show last night (for the 2nd time), and I noticed that at the end that Seacrest guy said, 'Seacrest out!'.  For the record, I didn't get my closing from him, HE got it from ME. Even he loves the Diva ;)  Diva out.
Chaos   urlLink This  is happening now in our lobby bar and at our pool.  Out of control.  But, its providing me with some bumping beats to type to.  Diva out.
On a lighter note  I heard  urlLink this  on the radio this morning, while driving past Miami Beach High School.  It was the best laugh I've had in weeks.  Diva out.
Gotta' give credit...  where credit is due.  For two weeks, consecutively, I have received child support payments.  DBD is now gainfully employed, and therefore, no longer a DBD.    He's paying, he calls to say hello, he's visiting this weekend and planning some quality time with his girls.  He's doing the right thing now.    I'm going to have to come up with some new moniker, or maybe I'll just stop writing about it altogether.  All is well, and the drama is gone.  *Big sigh of relief*  And thanks to the new support, I managed to have a whole $12 in my account on the day before payday.  That hasn't happened in a long, long time.  Life is good.  Diva out.
Refreshing point of view  While at lunch today with someone slightly older and, perhaps wiser, than me, the issue of gay marriage flashed across the TV screen again.    He reminded me:  30 years ago, a black man couldn't use the same toilet as a white man.  It was considered 'fundamentally wrong', and segration was 'right'.    Less than 100 years ago, women couldn't vote in this country.  It was unheard of, and well, 'fundamentally wrong'.    Maybe 20 years from now, gay marriage will have moved into the realm of desegregation and suffrage.  Something that just had to be allowed, because how could it possibly be otherwise?  Diva out.

Good News and Bad News  The good news is my sunburn doesn't hurt anymore. The bad news is now it itches.  Diva out.
Bark!  I can only guess what Fred's going to say about this one... but here goes.  I started taking an herbal extract on Sunday.  Its supposed to help stimulate my metabolism and assist my body in using the fat I've stored around my lower abdomen, hips and thighs.  Its taken from the bark of a tree that grows wild in Cameroon, Africa.  The drops are dark dark dark brown, and I have to put 30 to 40 drops into a glass of water, then drink it.  Someone asked me how it tastes, I told him it takes like I'm licking a tree.  It tastes like bark.  But, since I started taking it, I've noticed an increase in my energy level, a decrease in my apetite and I haven't wanted (or had any) coffee for two days now.   There's that little note on the bottle saying that the FDA hasn't acknowledged the claims for the product.  Funny, though, that there's a warning for some people with certain health conditions to avoid taking the product.  If it doesn't work, why should they have to warn some people about it?  All I know is I want to drop 10 lbs by the time I go to Boston in July and if I can do it with this bark drink, then bottoms up!  Diva out.
Overdue Update  Well, dear reader, needless to say I don't have internet at home - STILL.  Apparently my PC doesn't have enough RAM *sigh*... story of my life.  Working on it though, so have no fear.  Eventually, I will be able to inundate you relentlessly with unimportant details of my overwhelmingly fabulous life.  I think I must have swallowed a thesaurus with my morning coffee.  Let's see... unimportant details... well, first off I have been reminded of why I don't lay out on the beach, and why I do wear sunblock when I do get out into the brilliant South Florida sunshine.  Think of the brightest, reddest overcooked lobster you have ever seen, and that will give you an idea of what my right thigh and right upper arm look like today.  I carefully covered SOME parts of me with sunblock, heedlessly leaving way too much of me unprotected.  I have little red slivers of sunburn on my butt, since I thought it would be good to sun my buns a little yesterday... not the whole thing, but you know... a little more than is normally covered by my bathing suit.    Sitting, sleeping, walking, breathing... yep, they all pretty much hurt today.  And, as I am pretty sure he doesn't read this, I can tell you all that my online friend from NY has now moved to Sunny South Florida.  That's why I'm sunburnt today; he's busy soaking in the new, more relaxed lifestyle that we enjoy here.  Lounging on the beach on a Sunday afternoon was part of the initiation of local status.  Yummy Argentinian food on Saturday night - grilled chicken and sausage, sauteed spinach and some kind of a flambe'd dessert with caramel-filled crepes was another part of that initiation.  Peruvian and Colombian are also on the list of cuisines to try as he settles in to this multicultural area.  In addition to that, I had the pleasure of catching up with a friend that went away to the Army a little less than 2 years ago.  He came home injured... from playing soccer in California.  I know; it isn't heroic, but hey - it got him out of the service and back home safe & sound.   Had lunch in a riverfront cafe that I've been dying to check out, and it was really very nice.  So, in all, aside from the sunburn, I had a faaaabulous weekend.  Hope you did too.  Diva out.
Big Plans for the Summer   I have got my summer plans all wrapped up already.  Man, am I on top of things.  Yes, I am just that good. ';)  My daughter's First Communion is all but done for the 1st weekend in May - thanks mostly to my mother in law who is in complete control of that one.  Then there's the littlest diva's birthday / pool party the 2nd weekend in May.  For June, I've already booked at the  urlLink Celebration Hotel  for a visit to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot (Hey Fred, when's Gay Days?!?) with my girls and my mother in law.    For July, I've put together my very own Yoga Retreat.  I'm staying at  urlLink Boston Harbor Hotel  and plan on attending yoga classes at  urlLink Baron Baptiste's yoga studio in Boston .    Can't wait, can't wait, can't wait!  I am so ready for the summer.  Diva out.

Soooo South Beach   Check out  urlLink Life is a Drag .  And since you brought up the subject, there's a new movie coming out about two women who pretend to be men who pretend to be women... you know, drag queens.  All I can say is, I can't WAIT to see that movie on South Beach.  Honey, there's going to more lipstick, heels and high-hair wigs in that theater than a close-out sale at Frederick's of Hollywood.  Life is better than fiction.  Diva out.
Good Friday  Its Good Friday today, and they're serving fish in the employee cafeteria.  What a surprise.  And my hairdryer died this morning.  It slowed down, made this deep, whirring growl, then just faded away.  I threw it out.  But now I'm wondering if I should have kept it for another day or two... I mean, you know, maybe it could have started working again on Sunday.  Diva out.
My gift recieved  Sometimes even the simplest moment shared can be such a great gift.  I had the immense pleasure of having lunch today with one of our city's most prominent figures.  He's compassionate and passionate about where he lives and what he does.  Just about everyone loves him, because he's just that kind of a man.  I was filling in the time while his lunch appointment rushed to get to the hotel to meet with him.  In that 20 minutes or so, we talked about life in Miami Beach, careers, love and lovers, friends and the joy of being who we are.  I can't impart to you what it meant for me to sit quietly at a table. While I munching multi-grain bread slathered with sweet butter, the sun was shining in through the windows, people were moving through the lobby and past the pool, diners were chatting and chewing nearby.  The few minutes we spent talking were more time than I've ever really had to get to know this amazing person.  He loves living his life, he loves his job - Tourism Director for Miami Beach (and so much more), his views on dating, on working a room, on living.  And when you talk, he really listens.  He wants to know all about you in a very sincere way that you feel.    And, now, more than ever, I want to be just like him when I grow up.    Diva out.
Any excuse for a party  I was up late last night, making Egyptian Lentils for Maundy Thursday.  I'd never even heard of Maundy Thursday until last Sunday.  According to the female pastor at the Methodist Church where I study Buddhist meditation, Maundy Thursday is another name for Holy Thursday, the day Jesus instituted the Eucharist.  This is where we all sort of recreate the Last Supper by sharing a meal together.    Each year, this church gets together, preparing Middle Eastern meals like what would have been eaten way back then in the Middle East where Jesus lived and died.  We'll share our food and share stories of what god has done in our lives, or what he means to us; sing, dance, read poetry - whatever.  You know, 'Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow I die.'  I'm looking forward to it.  My Egyptian Lentils came out really good, and I've brewed up some Mint Tea for the occasion.   Yummy!  And, another cause for celebration - today is  urlLink Buddha's  birthday.  Happy Birthday Buddha!  Diva out.

Warning!   I hate hoax warnings, but this one is important.  Please send this to everyone on your e-mail list.  If a man comes to your front door and says he is conducting a survey and asks you to show him your ass, DO NOT show him your ass.  This is a scam; he only wants to see your ass.

LOL  There are times when I just don't laugh enough.  You know, days go by and a chuckle or giggle may escape me, but not those really hearty, robust laughs that shake your ribcage and make your face hurt.  I love those kinds of laughs.  Lately, I notice I've just been laughing more.  Laughing till tears are welling up in my eyes, laughing till I'm hoarse.    The other night, I was carrying my littlest diva with her head resting on my shoulder, her nose just brushing my neck.  I giggled; she breathed out her nose onto the softness of my neck.  I giggled louder.  Before we knew it, we were both giggling hysterically - me from being tickled and her from doing the tickling.  That was the release of a floodgate of laughter for me.  Now, I'm laughing quite a lot; at small misunderstandings and funny little anecdotes.  Life is funny, after all.  I'm feeling good, and my joy is flowing out in my laughter.  And, funniest thing of all is, the more I laugh, the better I feel.  Laughter must be so good for the soul.  Diva out.
What say you?  So with the new look came a new comment feature.  I switched from Haloscan to the Blogger comments.  But, I don't get comments now.  All except that one question regarding bubble boy.  So, I was going to test the comment thing, you know - 'Is this thing on?'  Turns out it was configured wrong and if you did want to comment on a post, you would have to sign in or something.    Well, I'm going to assume that THAT's the reason I've had no comments lately.  It couldn't possibly be that I've left you all speechless with my brilliance and charm.  *heh heh*  So, anyway, I've fixed the comments, so  when  you  want  to comment on a post,  now you can .  You're welcome.  Diva out.
Always Learning  My teacher/pastor mentioned last night how she has learned to see the good in everything that happens.  Even the 'bad' things have some kind of 'good' in them.  A blessing or a lesson.  I felt pretty good when she said it, because I already knew that.  Yesterday was a tough lesson for me.  I received a call about my mom, and that she's being treated for her mental illness again.  This happened off and on while I was growing up. Anyone who's had the same experience knows what I'm talking about.  I was either on my own or in charge of my younger siblings while mommy was not around.    I haven't really had to go back to that since being an 'adult', but yesterday, I was thrown back to being 5 years old and all alone.  But, instead of 'burying myself in my work' as my boss does, I decided to investigate my feelings on a deeper level.  Figure out what I was feeling, where I was feeling it, and why.    And I kept reminding myself that no matter how 'bad' a day I felt I may be having, ultimately it was my mother who was truly suffering.    So, I realized that there was some good in that experience and I looked for the lesson in it.  Then I said a little prayer for her, and for me, and today I hope we're both doing a little better.  Diva out.
Random Thoughts for today   Quote: 'Swallow your pride occasionally, it's not fattening.'  -  Frank Tyger  My coworker responded: 'To swallow, you need to chew first..and its too hard to be chewed.'

More Happy Happy Joy Joy  OR  Miscellaneous Happy News   First of all,  urlLink An Iraqi finds his own form of Democracy . Yay Salam Pax!  And to think, I read him when... his link has been on my blog since before the whole mess started, and its going to make a damn good movie, I think.  Next, seems like my good vibes are rubbing off on my oldest little diva.  I've been hauling her back and forth between school and afterschool, so she could stay late for jump rope practice.  That's right, jump rope.  She's a 'jumper', and she's got the quads and calves to prove it.  She's been going to practice with her team at least twice a week, and I've been schlepping over from my office to her school, to the youth center and back to my office after every practice.  Last night, her team competed against several other local elementary schools. It wasn't like what I've seen on ESPN, but it was very cool.  I never realized you could do so much with a jumprope.  Well, anyway, my daughter's team won FIRST PLACE in her category.  Woo-hoo!  I'm so proud.  And, finally, I bought my ticket to Boston today.  So, that's it.  I'm all set... all I have to do is wait for July to get here.    It's good being me right now.    Diva out.

Profoundness Foundness  Sometimes deep spiritual awareness can come from the most unlikely of places.

Everything new!  First of all, this is my first entry with the new Blogger look.  Love it!  Second new thing is  urlLink my new car .  After the driver side window wouldn't go up on Thursday, I decided it really was finally time to get a new car.  I've been putting it off and putting it off, and the window was the last straw.  I'd been doing my 'don't rain' dance for three days, since the window wouldn't go up.  On Sunday, I walked into a dealership that had contacted me on an internet query.  I was going to get something else, but I got such a good deal on this car instead, so I took it.   I think Fred will like it ~ in fact I know he would.  When you turn the headlights at night, the floorboards light up inside the car a lovely neon blue.  And the cupholders change colors from red to green, yellow to blue.  I have a disco in my car at night.  My little divas love it!  Diva out.
Open for Business  I've been practicing Asthanga yoga for more than 5 years now.  Granted, I've been a little lazy lately, and haven't really practiced at home regularly for a few months.  The last time I went to a class I injured myself deep down in my shoulder.   I couldn't move my arm in the morning when getting out of bed, and it ached for weeks.  Then, about 2 weeks ago, just as the shoulder stopped aching, I woke up with a stiff neck and it's still bothering me a little.  All excuses and delays aside, I went to an Open Yoga class last night.  I tried talking myself out of it, noting other 'more important' chores I could do instead.  I even arrived 10 minutes late to the asthanga class I had intended to take, but eventually ended up at the Open Yoga class instead.  Persistence prevailed!  It wasn't the usual asthanga, but I still was sweating while standing still.  I was introduced to a few poses that I have never tried, and found that challenging and fun.  It kind of shook me up a little.    I was reminded of why I love yoga.    This morning I'm a little sore, I'm sure its only a precursor to what tomorrow will be like.  But, still its not as deep an ache as asthanga gives me, or as deep as that injured shoulder asthanga gave me.  I'll still practice asthanga, but I'll probably mix it up a little more often.  Fred won't get this, but it just felt so good to sweat again.  Diva out.
Green Light Kind of Day   Most of the time, I hit every red light.  But this morning was a green light day.  I don't know why, but I every light I came to on my drive in this morning was green.  It's a great way to start a day!  And, I just found that  urlLink my cute little car  made the  urlLink Top 10 Gas Sippers List for 2004 . Which means I'm saving gas while rolling through those greens.    Diva out.
Gentle Reminder  Last night, while driving home after a yummy dinner at Sweet Tomatoes, I had what I thought was the misfortune of being caught up in traffic behind a v-e-r-y slow driver.  We're talking like 45 MPH when the limit is 55, and everyone does 65.  I was frustrated because I was trapped behind him for a minute or two, but was soon able to move into a faster lane.  Grrrrr....  But then, a few minutes later, the two left (fast) lanes slowed down to move around an accident.  An accident that had obviously occurred within the last 5 or 10 minutes.  There were 3 cars all crankled up together, and one man was lying flat on his back on the roadside, with a few people trying to help him.  Police and ambulance hadn't even made it there yet.  Suddenly, I kind of felt a little ashamed of my recent frenzy and frustration.  It may well be that, thanks to that v-e-r-y slow driver, I avoided being a part of this accident.  I just keep getting reminded that I don't always know the Plan, or what some other person has in mind.  I only know what I know, and I keep being reminded that I don't really know very much.    Diva out.
The Diva Way           View all problems as challenges. Look upon negativities that arise as opportunities to learn and to grow.

depressed?  my  urlLink boyfriend  *still not really used to that term* said i seemed depressed on friday night.  i didn't really think so at the time, maybe just a little tired.  but, then i realized that we are in summer now.  and i ALWAYS get depressed in the summer.  don't know why, i just do.  and of course my little diva-ettes are going away on sunday to visit their dad in atlanta for 15 days.  just the fact that they will be away from me for so long is enough to make me cry, nevermind it being summer too.  so, i'm fatigued for about a week now and i can't shake it.  got a kink in my neck since waking up friday morning which is adding to my fatigue.  little bit of a sore throat, so i'm also fighting a cold, and apparently losing that battle.  ok, a little depressed maybe.  but i'm taking the next 3 days off for a little r&r with my girls before they go away.  that may help.  diva out.
Mindful Meanderings   People move in and out of our lives constantly (especially when you work in a hotel!).  Most people move in and out of your line of vision without ever leaving a mark.  It is those rare, soul-shaking moments when you meet someone new, but somehow familiar, that truly leave marks on the soul.  It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it really makes you wonder (much like this entire blathering must be doing now).  I met someone like that the other day, new but not new, and I always relish moments like that.    Then, did you ever notice how poetry can make just about  anything  sound appealing?  Romantic and dreamy?  I'm going to a spoken word event tonight to hear a singer that I really like.  It always amazes me how poetry works on your brain, making everything from waterdrops to blood sound oh, so wonderful.   I'm tempted to write something poetic about some really horrible thing, like decomposing flesh or garbage or something, but I'll spare you.  Of course, if you'd like to submit something in comments... you'll only serve to prove my point.  Also, I had a subtle reminder of what it means to let god work through you.  I never really considered what it means, but I had a great lesson yesterday morning.  My littlest diva-ette grabbed a bagel to go for breakfast, but then never ate it.  So, I removed it from the car, still intact and figured I would have it for breakfast myself.  On the way from car to hotel, I came across one of the resident homeless men that linger on the sidewalk on our hotel block.  Sometimes he's there, sometimes not.  I asked if he would like it, and he asked me, 'You don't want it?'.  Kind of a funny reply, I think.  But I assured him that it was his, handed it to him and had some granola I keep stashed in my desk drawer.  My littlest diva was the tool that allowed the universe to get that man his breakfast.  You just never know what comes your way.  And just when will school go year-round?  I have to sign up my oldest diva-ette for summer camp at $750 for 10 weeks.  Not bad, until I find that I don't get a sibling discount, since I'm not a resident where the camp is, and the littlest diva will also cost $750.  $1500 for 10 weeks of fun in the sun.  I'm thinking a labor camp in Siberia may be better, put 'em to work and pay me! *sigh*    Wonder if Martha Stewart has any openings.  Diva out.

Rain!  After the driver's side window got stuck in the down position last month, I went out and bought my new car in a desparate act to avoid being rained on.   I got the car on May 9th - Mother's Day.    It finally rained today.  Boy, good thing I hurried up and got that car, huh?  Of course, I washed it yesterday, so I should have known.  Diva out.
North to Alaska...   Well Everyone,   I am off to Alaska on the 16th to compete in the marathon. I still need about $1000.00 more for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to meet my commitment, so if you can donate, or think of someone that may donate, I would appreciate it.   You can still go to  urlLink my site  and donate online. I am sorry but I havent updated it since the big Wine and Cheese party, and it was such a success too. Maybe I'll update it tonight. It's been kinda crazy, training for a marathon, getting my kid to all of his martial arts classes and swim team, workin', being a single Mom, fundraising, and... My God... what am I insane?   Anyway, if you wish to purchase raffle tickets for the grill, I have attached a flyer with the info. Please remember, if you donate towards the grill, be sure to email me your info, so that I can include you in the drawing on Saturday.   Please look for my further fundraising events and please feel free to share any ideas, that you may have to assist in my fundraising efforts.   Thank you again, EVERYONE, for your support.   With warmth in my heart and hope for the future,   Elizabeth Whitener
Not Just a Woman's Prerogative   urlLink Change Your Mind Day  is this Saturday.  I'm heading up to Tampa for one of the events.  Would love to be able to go to NYC at Central Park, but Tampa will have to do for now.  Check the site, maybe there's an event near you.  Doc and Candy may be especially interested ';)  Diva out.
Post Memorial Day Post  Well, this year's memorial day was kind of a bust, in that i got no bbq at all this year.  not a rib, not a wing, not a weenie.  *sigh*  But, on the good side, I did get to see the movie 'The Day After Tomorrow', and of course going to see a big summer blockbuster open on Memorial Day is part of the whole tradition, right?  Yeah, honor our warriors by grilling steaks and watching people blow things up on the big screen.    So, it was pretty good and it struck a few chords in me, considering how much i am thinking about impermanence and emptiness these days.  *meditation is really sinking in*  Of course, there were a few quirks, like the phoney monster-like very digitally enhanced wolves scene, and just what happened to the people on that ship anyway?  nothing was topsy turvy in the kitchen, so they didn't fall out, the ship didn't go under and back up, nobody froze (that you could see)... ah, minor details that you are NOT supposed to think about.  Just watch the movie and eat your popcorn, and shut up already.  Liked it, would see it again.  Hope all of dear readers (all 2 or, dare I say 3, of you!)had a faaaabulous Memorial Day Weekend too.  Diva out.   **in afterthought, diva whispers carefully to herself... i'm sure that part about not getting any weenies this weekend will get Fred going on for a bit***
On a good day   I just got chased through the kitchen by the chef, weilding a live lobster at me.  And, somehow, that has been the highlight of my day.  Diva out.
Party Pooper  I have been staying up late to watch the Democratic Convention on tv.  Yes, I'm a Democrat - I'm not rich enough to be Republican.  But this convention goes on way past my usual bedtime.  I'm exhausted.  I mentioned to my boss today that I am strongly considering moving to Illinois, just so I can vote for Barack Obama.  He replied, 'Some day it may not matter; you'll be able to vote for him no matter which state you live in.'  hmmm... President Obama....  you never know. If you missed his keynote speech last night, you missed history being made.  He's really something.  Diva out.

Penny for your thoughts    I had the distinct pleasure of taking part in a research panel last night on my new Scion xA.&nbsp; Not only did they ask my opinions of my cute little car, but they paid me for my time.&nbsp;   I may have learned more from that meeting than the crew did.&nbsp; The chief engineer and designer from Japan was there, along with several other people from both Japan and California.&nbsp; There were only 2 other xA owners on the panel with me.&nbsp; But they were seriously into cars.&nbsp; One guy immediately removed the Pioneer stereo for something 'better', changed the wheels and tires, added coil-overs (whatever the hell they are) and lowered the car.&nbsp; The other guy (of course these were both guys!) added a feature where he flicks his high beams to open the security gate in his building!   This last one really impressed the car design team.   And, apparently, there's quite a sub-culture surrounding the  urlLink Scions .&nbsp; xB'ers look with disdain on the xA'ers, we're like the red-headed step children of the Scion world.&nbsp; xA'ers commune with one another, and are likely to beep and wave at each other while passing on the highways.&nbsp; And who knows what the newly release tC coupe will bring to the picture.   There's even on online forum 'Scion Life' where Scion owners unite and chat.   In the meantime, I'm just a boring little single mom diva driving around in what apparently is some sort of cultural phenomenon.&nbsp; Who knew?   All I know, is I got paid :)   Diva out.

There's no place like home -- OR&nbsp; -- Home is where the Heart is  Hello dear reader, and welcome to another episode of my diva-ness.&nbsp; I set out for Bahstn (that's Boston for most of us) last Thursday, where I spent 5 days exploring the city.&nbsp; I had intened to immerse myself in yoga, but... well... that didn't happen. &nbsp; I did go to a class, but the teacher I wanted to see didn't actually teach there.&nbsp; So, in the end, I flew to Boston for a class I can take here in Miami.&nbsp; Whatever. &nbsp; I still managed to walk every inch of that town, from North End (Little Italy) to South End, Chinatown and Cambridge (Harvard).&nbsp; I saw Paul Revere's house, Benjamin Franklin's house, some famous poet's house (I forgot all of his 3 names right now - Longfellow?), and even Ye Olde Oyster House, established waaay back in the 1600's.&nbsp; You Boston readers will probably know I've gotten most of this wrong, but I was never very good in history anyway. &nbsp; I loved the blend of old, 17th century buildings mixed with modern, glass skyscrapers.&nbsp; And Beacon Hill - yeah, I could live there&nbsp;(in the summer).&nbsp; I walked up all 294 (?) steps of the Bunker Hill Monument.&nbsp; My heart was working so hard that a closed-up cut on my finger started to bleed again!&nbsp; And you'd think they could at least open the windows up there, for cryin' out loud.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I stayed in a historical hotel, so historical that I was afraid to open my eyes all of my first night there.&nbsp; I was afraid I'd open them and see dead people.&nbsp; I visited 4 or 5 cemeteries while there, all dating back to the 1600's.&nbsp; I love old cemeteries, and these were the oldest I've ever visited.  &nbsp; Old churches, old streets, old houses - all preserved and blended in with modern buildings.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Although, I did miss my little divas and my new boyfriend.&nbsp; I was sooo ready to come home by Sunday, but was there till Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think I'll be travelling alone again anytime soon.&nbsp; It was great, but it may have been better with someone to share it with. &nbsp; I took more than 200 pics, and once I get them all together on my website, I'll share some with you.&nbsp; Of course, they don't actually have me in them, since there was no body around to take my picture.&nbsp; But I did manage to take a few special ones for Fred. &nbsp; That's all for now, diva readers.&nbsp; Gotta get back to my buried desk and get something done. &nbsp; Diva out. &nbsp; &nbsp;
Parlez vouz?  I have discovered the coolest  urlLink translation website .  I often need to write letters in French and Spanish, and have to farm the work out to someone in the hotel who speaks and writes the language.  Now, I can translate things myself!

We Need Rain!   Not only does the current drought cause  urlLink troublesome brushfires , but I remember reading somewhere that dry rainy seasons create perfect conditions for strong hurricanes.  The basis of that thought was established with Hurricane Andrew, and research on previous rain measures prior to hurricanes in the past.  The fires are probably 20 miles west of here, but smoke filled the air downtown this morning, and you can smell it all the way over here on Miami Beach.  Its as bad as the media makes it out to be.  I am  so close  to going outside and doing a little rain dance.  Either that, or I may just break down and  wash my car.  ';)  Diva out.
Living Vicariously   An email I received from a friend who just returned from attempting to climb to the top of the Grand Tetons in Jackson, Wyoming...   'I just want to say to you that it was  a pleasure and an honor to share this experience with you all.  I am  one lucky bitch.  love, amy  Hi all, Here is the link to the Mac site with photos from Gloria and my attempt  to summit the Grand Teton.   urlLink PhotoAlbum10.html   Angela was our guide and Karen came along to audit.  We hit some rough  weather as we approached the saddle the first day at about 11,400 feet;  first it rained, then grapple, otherwise known as hail, and then snow  with lighting and thunder.  It snowed and blew hard through the evening  accumulating about 4 inches, when we got up at 3 am.   We struggled to  about 1000' from the summit, but both Angela and Karen agreed that it  was taking too long and it was too icy to continue.   (Besides the fact  that both G and I were damn cold.)  It was a wonderful adventure and I learned a lot.  We were the only  group up there that evening and the mountain was beautiful.  When the  sun finally did come out it was truly a glorious sight.  None of the  other groups that followed us up made the summit either, so that  confirmed our decision.  The camaraderie made the experience and the serenity and majesty of the mountain will draw me back.  xoxo,  Amy'   I have to admit I have absolutely no desire to climb a mountain, but its kind of nice to dream... and to read first-hand from someone who has.  Diva out.
Referred to in the Referrer  I've been meaning to comment on this before, and today I think I can put it off no longer.  I always get a kick out of the Referrer spot on my blog, the place that tracks web referrences to this page; in a most unscientific and sporadic way.  I once read a blog page that added symbols to misspell a popular current topic, just to avoid being referred to in search engines.  Now I see why.  I get some of the weirdest mentions on that little referrer!  And, sadly, sometimes that referrer is more entertaining than my blog.  What sparked my comments today was the 'miami beach shitty fireworks' search.  First of all, why would anyone search in that specific way?  What exactly were they looking for?  Second, I didn't mention fireworks on the beach in my blog... did I?   Maybe I did.  Anyway, I think its funny because, obviously, I am not the only one with that opinion of this year's fireworks.  And, perhaps, the searcher was there too.  Sitting on Miami Beach, with me and 49,998 other spectators, waiting and waiting... for a show that started too late and ended too soon.  We are all connected, and sometimes we get to see little hints of this truth.  Diva out.
Don't You Hate It When...   When it doesn't rain like its supposed to in the summer?  Days are too hot, a/c units break down, and palmetto bugs *ick* come out of everywhere looking for water.  When you're wearing your big granny underwear (for  those  days) and you realize (a little too late) that when you reach down for a file, the granny undie waistline reaches far above your pants waist - BUSTED!  When the one gift you've been waiting for for MONTHS finally gets delivered, but its broken.  When you do nice things for people and they take advantage of it and complain when little things don't go just right.  When your boss takes off in the middle of the day to go to the gym, and you're stuck in the office holding down the fort.  When a good friend is hurting but you don't really know how to make her feel any better about all that she's losing.  When your day makes you just want to shrivel up in a hole somewhere and never be nice to anyone or get close to anyone ever again.  Just one of those kinds of days...  Diva out.

Woo-hoo!  Yesterday, someone asked me about my blog and whether or not I knew how many people visited it.  I said, with great pride, that, 'Yes, and I've had almost 5000 hits in a little more than two years'.    urlLink Wow, it's been more than 2 years.   But I see that I was incorrect, because my little counter in the corner says 5004.  Woo-hoo! Thank you, thank you dear readers.  You like me, you really like me. (couldn't resist).

The Sky is falling!  For those of you who know what I mean, Mercury is going retrograde on Monday. And, from all accounts, its going to be a bitch.  Mercury hasn't even started yet, and my daughter just lost my brand new, very cool cell phone that I got in June. wahhhhh!!

Wonderful World  It is absolutely, positively impossible to be in a bad mood while listening to Loius Armstrong's 'What a Wonderful World' CD.

Yes, indeed.  Diva out.
Gotta have friends  I guess I would be remiss if I didn't mention the great time I had with two of my friends over the weekend.  Friends from high school, Gardenpixie, Wyldchyld and myself all met for sushi with our significant others.  We are, and have always been, quite a potpourri of girls.  My boyfriend even asked me how it could be that we were ever friends ~ we are very different from each other in general.  Gardenpixie and her hubby were celebrating their 17th wedding anniversary, they married very young and the marriage just keeps holding.  Wyldchyld brought along her new boyfriend, as she and her got-married-really-young husband have split.  Then there's me with my online boyfriend after a very shortlived marriage.  We have different tastes in music, food and fun.   We may not have much in common, but somehow there is a common thread that binds us.  Years and miles have been unable to undo the ties.  And, when I'm with my friends, I feel 16 again.  And, just as we did years ago, I never laughed so hard as when I'm with my friends.  I'm fortunate to have a great collection of eclectic friends from all walks of life.   It probably confuses the hell out of my boyfriend, trying to figure out  why  I call these people friends, but honestly, there is no rhyme or reason to my friendship.  It's pretty much out there for anyone who'll claim it.  Diva out.

I'm really tired now, I've been doing yard work for just about all day. Mowing, Trimming,  and Pruning. Sure I had help, but I still feel like falling over and sleeping. But alas, I have some things to do.  I'm in the process of converting a table layout to XHTML and CSS (tableless). Its not too easy, but with  urlLink glish's amazing CSS layouts  as a guide, I'm managing.  Before I finish, I just want to tell anyone that reads this to  Post a Comment!

Mood : Very Sad   Weather : Nice and Sunny (Happier than I am)  Well this is it. After some testing, and thinking, this is my blog v 0.9 Almost done ;)...  My favorite Anime got lisenced by Funimation today, no more amazing subbed episodes for me. It's called FullMetal Alchemist, and in short - its amazing. I wish there was somthing I could do, but I'm afraid there isn't. I don't have Cable or Satelite, so I probably won't be able to watch it when it comes on TV. It make me so angry. Well that's the downlight for today.
I woke up this morning feeling really depressed...dunno why. last nite b4 going to bed, I prayed to God for me and him...hoping that everything wud be fine with us one day. I prayed for God to give me a sign. Then I dreamt that he was with me and we were about to catch a plane somewhere.  Me n my boyfriend, we've been togather for 3 years. I live here in Singapore and he lives in New York. We keep our relationship going by telephone and by me or him making the effort to fly up to see each other but that happens 2 or 3 times a year depending on whether he can make it here. All the time when we're apart, I feel so 'apart' from him. People ask, why don't u both get married. Well, I guess God is not allowing that to happen yet.  5 months ago I fell into a very deep depression. I was on anti-depressant and I cannot stop crying for days. I became better after afew weeks and I told myself that I never want to go thru this again but now I can feel it creeping back to me and I dunno how to prevent this. My boss came to me at work this morning and ask me why am I so quiet?! He mentioned that he's afraid to see me be so quiet. I didn't respond coz I know that if I did I would break down.  I find my life so unmeaninful. I'm doing things that people close to me wants me to do. If given the choice, I wud just resign from this hell hole of my company and take a break for 3 or 6mths go for a holiday....be with him (my boyfriend) for awhile and come back and do things I want to do.....why is it so difficult for me to make such a decision?
Hi, my name is Hani. I'm from Singapore. I'm 34years old and still single....life for me lately have been like a topsy turvy and I'm here to let out my feelings, get to know people and to welcome all of you out there to give me your views, your support and your opinions....   Firstly, I have to say the most depressing part of life right now is my job. I hate getting up in the morning going to a job that I don't enjoy, that I think is not fulfilling and meaningless. This job is full of politics and back stabbers. How can I stay long in such an environment? I know that most of you out there will tell me to leave but the money is luring me to stay alittle longer than I should. I'm now looking to do something that I want but I'm lost and confused, dunno where to begin. Than comes my long distance relationship. I've been with a man who prctically lives 20,000miles away from me and if I'm not up there to see him, the only form of contact is the phone and it's not helping me.....
Hello to all of you, salut Ã  toutes :-)   First off, thanks to all of you who came for the  Movie & Martini extravaganza @ Kim`s . It was COOL. & Kim, thanks for having us. :-)  You Rock!!  I  loved  the videos. They really hit home on how women are so so so negatively portrayed in the ads.  As objects (and not subjects) of our own destiny.... The impact on us is phenomenal. 3000 ads viewed daily. In the next 10 years, you'll be seeing about ten million nine hundred thousand ads. 10,950,000. Most of them, i guess, women.    To continue our discussion on media & women, let's bring magazines to our next meeting. I'd suggested males mags but let's do that another time. I'll get a movie about that another time.   For now, let's stick to women's & girls to keep the impact going.  WHERE: Royal Oak, Laurier street (between King Edward & Cumberland street)  Time: Same as usual 7:30  What you need: 1 magazine. Yourself.    ;-) See you tuesday. Anne-Sophie
Thanks to Cynthia and Anne-Sophie for the awesome potluck last night.  The food was so delicious, I couldn't stop eating.  Well, I hope we didn't create too much of a mess.  See you fabulous gals on Tuesday!  Apryl  P.S. Sex and the City:  Feminist or no?
Bonjour les petites madames,  This time, I am all inviting you to the Collection, Tuesday, June 15, 7:30pm.  For the last few weeks, we have had a lot of fun discussing women issues, relationships, the impact of media, women role models, etc. But this time, I would like to propose something a little different.  First:  Each one of you should bring a baby or kid picture of yourself. Then, you need to present us a passion that you have, a book that you read, or an activity that you do and that the other girls don't really know about.  I think it would be a great way to solidify our bonds =)  By the way, the Collection manager told us he would do any Martini we want, who knows, we might even be able to negotiate a discount hihi!  Hope to see you all Tuesday and tonight (Friday) at our little potluck party.
Salut!  Here's the update on this week's going ons for tuesday june 22nd.   1) To log on to your account, www.blogger.com then loging with name & password. I sent you all an invite, if you need one again email me cynsophie@yahoo.ca   2)Some of us are going to the golf shooting range at 6 (Jackie, Shoshannah, April, Anne-Sophie, Cynthia, the Swinging Sistahs). If you want to go, email we'll get organized.   WHERE: Rockliffe driving range to shoot a bucket of balls. A free expert giving us tips. It is very cheap $10 for 115 balls (so you share a bucket) and $2 to get clubs. (so $6 each)    3)  7:30  at Apryl's place. She couldn't post her message, so here it is for her.   Hey everyone!  As you know, I've invited y'all to my place for next Tuesday's meeting.  I actually live just in front of Jodi and Kim's place, so it's easy to find.  The address is 283 MacLaren St., and the apt. and buzzer # is 205.  I'm planning to make sangria (with white wine), but feel free to bring whatever you like.   There has been bits and pieces of discussion around Sex and the City and whether or not it can be read as a feminist show.  I would like to show a few clips from the show and hopefully delve deeper into the discussion.  I'm planning to also post some articles on our blog (if I can figure out how to do so).  I've also been reading a lot about Showtime's new series called The L Word, which is a show about a group of lesbians.  I've downloaded a few episodes, and I think it would be interesting to watch some clips and compare the female friendships and love relationships to those of SATC.   I think it would also be very interesting to hear why everyone has joined this group, and what each woman hopes to gain/contribute or discuss in future meetings.  Hope everyone can make it for some sangria and some Sexy conversation!!!     4) New Invitees:   I've added Rebecca & Sabine to join us. So please include them in your emails. They're 2 really awesome girls with great head on their shoulders, mucho pizzaz & style, fab ideas and great life experiences... amongst other things. So Welcome to you both, look forward to seeing you soon.:)     THAT'S IT FOR ME TODAY! Can't wait to go golfing. At least this time, my brother won't be there to hit me in the head with his golf club like he did 12 years ago, the bastard! ;)   Anne-Sophie.
Bonjour les filles,   Ceci est un test. C'est une de mes premiÃ¨res expÃ©riences sur ce site et j'essaye de m'y apprivoiser. I am looking forward to tomorrow's Martini evening with the ladies, sharing our baby pics and life passions! A+  SaraChichita
Hello ladies!  I'm looking forward to the collection tomorrow night and seeing some more baby pics.  Anne-Sophie, you are so cute!  You've hardly changed.  Well, I'd like to extend an invitation to the group to come to my home, perhaps for our June 22nd meeting?  I'd be happy to make sangria for everyone and come up with a topic as well.  We can stay here for a couple of hours and then head out, depending on what everyone wants to do.  Vincent has no problem making himself scarce for the evening :)  We can discuss it at tomorrow's meeting!  See you then.  xo Apryl
urlLink    Ok, so I won't be there on tuesday, but that's me when I was in kindergarden. Have I changed? nah, my finders still look like small sausages.. hehehe&nbsp; urlLink

Hey ladies!  I just wanted to post a link to a website that contains a lot of discussion on 'The L Word'.  This should give everyone some background information on the show, its plot and the characters.  Here is the link: www.afterellen.com/TV/thelword/firstseason/html  If it doesn't allow you to click on it you should be able to copy and paste the url.  See everyone on Tuesday!  Apryl

We're Wine & Cheesing at Cynthia & my place for the occasionn. Bring 1 cheese  or patÃ© and something to drink with it too.  Sara suggested we discuss friendship this week. What is a  friend?

Hi guys,  Sorry for the short notice, but I got quite a good idea for this week.  Let's meet and do a little Tarot, palm reading, ouija and intuition card session!  April said we can do it at her place... (Thanks April) she will send the indications to get there soon.  So bring all the spiritual stuff you have home... I will try to bring a few candles and tea so we can create a relaxing ambiance... You are welcome to bring anything you would like!  See you tomorrow!  Cynthia
Salut Ã  toutes! Hello!  This tuesday, i would like to talk about sports. Not like the guys tho, unless you want to. Personally, I like to keep my body busy with loads of activities (walk, blade, cycle, run, swim, softball, yoga, etc..) Keeps it and my brain happy. i thought it would be cool to talk about how we all compose with the daily realitiy of physical activity, what makes us feel good and why.   Since we`re talking about that and since I LOVE gelato, what do you say we all get some ice cream, have a chat while we`re there and then decide if we want to just go for a walk after that or if it`s crappy, we`ll relocate to an indoor location, maybe the Manx or the Pump.  So we`ll meet up at PURE GELATO on Elgin Street. I`ll have my cell if need be: 371-6352 @ 7:30 for ice cream, and probably move out of there by about 8:15 @ the latest.  See you then! Don`t wear lipschtick, we're licking some ice cream.....   Anne-Sophie.
My name is Greg and this is my story. After you read this, you'll understand why everybody thinks I'm a big, fat loser. I grew up in Pacifica surfing on the beach with my ten foot woody at the tender age of five.Shaka Brah!! Once I got bumped by a great white!!!But I fought it off with a piece of drift wood nearby. I then moved to Hayward. And shortly after I went on a hunting trip with my father and I got struck by lighting but don't ask my mom about it because shes' too traumatized to speak about it. Damn that hurt!! I have had a lot of interesting jobs since then. While I was attending Tennyson High School I drove a hurse. I would like to think of it as a morbidly fascinating job.I became temporarily unemployed. Perhaps it was because of my late night mung jumping fetish.I then became a bouncer in San Francisco but the gay men kept beating me up.So I finally figured I had enough of the exotic jobs and I put in an application at my local Radio Shack.But that turned out to be worse because of all the fighting in the store. I beat up more people there then I did working at the club in San Francisco.All of the stress at the Radio Shack job made my heart problems get worse and I had to jab a heart needle into my chest with my last ounce of strength.And then!!!And no more and then!!!Since I wasn't picking up any hot babes at the local Radio Shack I decided to quit my job and start batting for the other team. I guess all those gay clubs rubbed me the right way.I met this really tall dark and handsome boy with a stubbly chin named Orlando. That summer we kissed and I knew at that moment I had made the transition from a boy to man hood. As he fondled my supple man breasts on the grassy knoll, I knew he was Mr. Right. Just as I was about to reach Home Base (hee hee), my dad called to tell me to take out the trash. Due to my homophobic father, I could no longer see Orlando and I had to settle for a green dildo and a large container of vaseline.  During the summer, I took a trip to Reno for Hot August Nights. I rode a Harley along with some of my friends, who also took their bikes. You wouldn't believe how many hot chicks couldn't get enough of me! I have had a couple of jobs since then but my freak accidents always land me back into enemployment.One day I met the perfect girl she looked like me, she smelled like me, and she also could never keep a job like me.What a coincidence she had the same freak accidents as me.Its twelve 'o' clock i love you the most im in love with you most and you're the cutest.Im in love so much that my dick is glowing like a glaze donut.And beacuse I live with my parents I will never have to work again.This is great they even said they would buy me a house in Woodchuck.
I have this love hate relationship with Solitaire. You know, that funny little card game that has come with windows since the dawn of time, or the dawn of windows, those two always seem to blur for me. Anyway. I play it way to much. My second semester in a Canadian High school is boring, on an academic level at least, I get maybe one or two pieces of homework every other week, its ridiculous, in England, you get a piece of homework each class, everyother day, and there's like, six classes a day. Damn you relaxed Canadians, I love you all. So I have a lot of spare time, I waste it away by getting frustrated at solitaire, listening to music, talking to my friends and writing in the book. But always with the solitaire, it just keeps coming back, I don't even remember opening it, but I always find myself halfway through a game missing an Ace with no way to get to it, its stupid. And of course, if I'm asked to do anything out side of the pit of despair that is my room, I have to finish the game of solitaire I'm playing, and if I can't win that one, I have to keep playing till I do. I don't get much sleep.  Damn you Microsoft
You fear what's behind the door, He's passed out on the floor, Needle in his arm, Blood on his chest. He really doesn't look his best.  Slowly coming to realize, What you saw before was just a cheap disguise, And for a second, You wouldn't mind joining him on the floor,  And imagination dies a little more.   That's an even earlier one, I'm not going to post anything in any type of chronological order for a while, until I run out of back logs. I'm just going to go through and post what I still like the look of.
Failure to see, Inability to be, You are a guiding light for me. Dying inside, Trying to hide, How you make me feel.  Yeah, thats one from a few weeks back, front page of the book when I first got it. I find it kinda cheesy, but it flows nice, so I thought it would be nice to post.
I mean, seriously, I have my own webspace with access to my friend's free home grown blogger, why the hell am I using this google thing?  maybe its because nobody knows this is here, and I'll just use this as an updatable spot for my work, which is mainly poetry of some sort.  It's funny, I don't even know what to call what I write, I just refer to it as the writings.  I named my earlier works 'The Art of Rambling' or AoR for short, so that's where the blog title comes from.  The book I write in is just some random 300 page A4 notebook on which I have pasted a biohazard symbol, not many of my friends bother to ask what I'm writing, when I don't respond they just assume its a journal of some sort. If you know me, kudos for finding this, and I hope that what I post here gives you a lovely insight to my mind, If you don't know me, feel free to comment.
Clearly breathing but not alive, In this poor excuse for a show tune, Seething desires behind clockwork fires, made by people who just don't care.  As the smoke is never ending, in the darkness of our minds, The light here is forever fleeting, and we can never see the skies.   If anybody ever cared, I don't title these things when I write them, I give them titles when I post. Slowly, but surly, I'm going to run out of these crappy little writings to post, and then I'll have to talk. Gladly, I don't have a life, so I can't really talk about that, but I'm sure something interesting will present itself for me to talk about.
Even though your brain seems scarred, And kept behind ageless bars, For solitary is just to good for you. The thoughts that bounce around that cage And keep you in a constant rage, You never even stopped to wonder, where in hell you were. Though peices of your minds desire, wander alone amongst the fire, that burns around the clock through a window in your head. Waves upon your shattered dreams, Where fear lies in between the seams Where reality is begining to come undone.   That's an old one, but it's one of my favorites. Seemingly odd that nobody reads this. Well, maybe the crazy friend. I wodner if I should start linking people.
Walking through the downtown of your brain, Looking for the store of your dreams, Where the last peice of your sanity is for sale, And you smile over the counter  As I charge it to my heart.  I walked down the highstreet,  Sign posted with your fears, A car that was our friendship just hit a baby deer, The cries are those from your childhood, I tried to help as much as I could. But the cackle of the driver eminates from the hood.  I reach my apartment, Located in your eyes, Today was a grey day, And grey days I dispise,  A sign in the window, Of the window of your smile,  Out of my mind, back in five minutes.  I'm told that one was really good. Of course, I don't believe anybody who says any of this is good. I wrote it in 5 minutes whilst talking over MSN, I don't even have a hard copy, it's just sitting there in my chatlogs.  The crazy friend who says I can sing constantly tells me I should write music and turn these things into songs.  I told you shes crazy.
Bathe, in these flames, My thoughts, yours for keeping, Still my mind is slowly creeping, Out of my eyes, blind to the lies, That you're weaving, Slowly my mind keeps on creeping.  Eat, taste my flesh, Chew my brain, don't stop feeding, That sound is my soul, gently weeping, Close, shut my ears, Deaf to screams, I'm not hearing, Thats still just my soul, gently weeping.  Fly, turn away, You won't care, I'm still leaving. Thats just my anger, slowly seething. Run, get away, I have gone, you stopped breathing, These are my words that you're reading.  And you and I, We don't know why, It has to die,  We have to try.   So, havn't said anything for a while, life had a bit of an uppy downy type thing going for a few days back there, but I'm back on a constant level of bleh. The best of my few friends said that she liked my singing, I thought she was talking to someone else at the time. Im going to have to put a stop to that, probably over lots of cups of coffee that I have to learn to like, stupid caffine junkie canadians.
Ah, but dear reader, the question is not who am I? but simply, who are you? You are here, reading these very words, for a reason, known only to yourself. But you must ask yourself, what lasting effect will this collection of works have on you?  Time shall tell.
As senior year approaches, I've been thinking a lot about how I stack up against my peers in terms of maturity.  Its hard to say where I stand because in certain areas it seems like I'm ahead of the game but, as I'm my own worst critic, I know that deep down I'm a kid.  Not all that kid at heart kind of crap.  I'm a kid.  As you know from my profile and previous posts, I very much enjoy playground games like dodgeball and kickball.  That's okay. you may say, those are actually becoming hip again.  No, I think I like them at a different level than the twentysomethings who have founded those leagues.  To illustrate my point, I will tell you, the faceless and nameless, that I still am tempted to buy G.I. Joes.  Very tempted.  When I was at Target reserving my limited edition of Halo 2 as I said yesterday, I wandered done the toy aisle.  Not to reminisce.  To see what they had in the way of my favorite action figures.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Besides vehicles, they had figures in two packs for seven bucks and three packs for nine.  There was a Cobra three pack and I probably would have bought it if I didn't already have the Cobra Commander.  I pulled myself away with my last vestige of dignity (I was admiring them alongside a six-year-old) and left to find my mom and youngest brother.  But today, at Fred Meyer's it came at me again.  I even avoided the toy department in fear of another test of willpower, but Satan had other plans.  Browsing the school supplies, waiting for my the same brother, I spied a discount table.  Bored, I went over to it.  There was my second temptation.  A Cobra plane.  That converted to a hydrofoil.  On sale.  As I have neither a plane or boat for the bad guys, this almost proved to great for me to overcome.  But after almost three minutes of indecision, I somehow stopped myself and left.  But I fear the third temptation, my friends.  Even as I write this I am choking down regret that I did not purchase these infantile delights.  I am growing weak.  I fear I cannot leave the house lest I revert back to my seven year old self.  And the rationalizer in my wants to ask you, am I so wrong?  Is what I desire so bad? Tell me your opinion of my plight, dear reader.  I feel so alone.
I realized today that I am an addict to Minesweeper. How did I realize this, when it's so hard for addicts to admit their problems? Even addicts have to admit that one is addicted when one sees the little Minesweeper numbers even when one has his/her eyes closed and is not looking at a computer screen.  Yes, it is painful for me to say, especially here among such esteemed colleagues, but perhaps ridicule is the medicine I need to help me stay on the road to recovery.  And while I think about it, there are worse addictions...like to narcotics, opiates, hallucinogens, inhalents, Altoids, bad music, Fabio, toasters, etc.  That's my news for the moment.
...and there was something strangely refreshing about it.  I think that just like the green leafy things that grow around my house, we all need a little water to fall on us and soak us sometimes.  Not that we'd die without it, but then, those plants won't die either.  But just that it helps us to reach a higher plane of health, some plateu from which we can stand and scream into the gray falling skys 'I am alive!  I am alive!  I may be soaking wet, but I am alive!' before we realize the entire church is now staring at us. A weird thing about rain is how much it changes things.  I mean, its just a little bit of water, right?  We drink tons of water every day.  But once a tad bit of it starts falling on us, people totally freak out.  They drive really slowly, they run around screaming as they fail to locate their cars, they fight over strange little sticks with canvas, and some of them even curse loudly as their attached furry headcovering are drenched through.  (Something about messing up their style.  I fail to grasp it.)  People who would normally be quite glad to lay on a hillside with me and chat the day away are now flabbergasted at the suggestion.  What's their problem, anyways?  We're 80% water to begin with...how's a little more gonna hurt?  The most depressing thing about rain, though (well, the only depressing thing about rain) is that it covers up the stars.  My nightly glimpses into the black and starlit heavens has been a favorite time of mine to contemplate how truely insignificant that little peon is who decided to cut me off today and ended up almost causing a major accident.  After all, what does it really matter if i jumped out of my speeding hunk of metal, holding another peice of metal alloy, and began hitting both a large bit of metal and some carbon based object that was significantly softer than the large hunk of metal?  It really doesn't, does it?  Its times like these when I can convince myself that perhaps those other bits of carbon carrying much smaller peices of metal will agree with me and decided not to use their peices of metal to embed even smaller peices of metal into my carbon.  I find this view extremely relaxing.  But without the stars, its utterly impossible to obtain.  I did decide on the rules to my new sport, though.  Its called 'Shirt Basketball'.  Dunks (anything involving contact between either of your hands/digits and any part of the target) are worth one point.  This includes shots where you pull the shirt away from the target's body in order to make the shot possible.  Free Throws, shots where the target intentionally invites a shot after stopping and pulling their own shirt forward to enable the shot to be made, are also worth one point, unless they are made from four point distance, in which case it is worth three.  Here's where things get tricky.  Because of the wide variety of shirts worn by various targets, and differing amounts of room between said shirt and the target (caused by non-standard shirt types, larger-than-average amounts of cleavage, skintight verse baggy shirts, etc.) the points differ based on both difficulty and distance.  Standard scoring works as such: within five feet of the target is worth two points.  Outside of five feet is worth four.  Mulitpliers are added based on the difficulty of the shot.  Contestants determine the value of each target (and their attached shirt) before competition begins.  Both must agree on the value before taking a shot.  In the event a shot is made before a value is agreed upon, an arbitrary third party is asked to set a fair value.  When lacking a third party, the opponent is allowed to pick a fair value.  The maximum multiplier for normal circumstances is ten times the normal point value, with the rare exception of a shot being made on a target wearing only a bra (or appropriate equivelent) which garners a twentyfive times bonus, and a shot made on a completely bare target, which garners a hunderd times bonus along with a wack across the back of the head for being dumb enough to waste such a valuable opportunity.  Additional multipliers are added based on circumstances, such as backwards, no look (eyes shut), hook shots, off hand shots, using an unusual object (such as a computer monitor), using a difficult object (something that doesn't easily fit, also like a computer monitor or even something simpler like a basketball), using an awkward object (ice that the target cannot easily retreive), cauing the target to remove clothing to fetch the object, and evoking a positive reaction from the target (such as an invitation to retireve the object yourself).  Points are lost for injuring the object, evoking a negative reaction (such as a bitch slap or forced removal from a house or resteraunt), or shooting on a target in a dangerous situation (such as the driver of a vehicle).  It is also not reccomended to shoot on targets with which one is not familiar, or which one is not signifantly faster than.  I predict Shirt Basketball will make it to the Olympics by 2020.  Only you, my valiant readers can help make this dream a reality.  Go forth and throw things down shirts, men!  Do it for justice, for honor, and for the American Dream: to earn money without doing any real work!
I'm starting a weekly column here.  I'll call it Ben Questions the Billions. Question 1: Is the only difference between a cult and a religion numerical?
Just reserved Halo 2.  Supposed to be out November 9th.  Hopefully by then I'll be all done with college applications because I'm pretty sure I'm doing early action (or decision I don't know which is the non-binding one) at every place I apply.  Then I will have time to play the most anticipated game of alltime.  In other news, all the horsemen and assorted other cool kids from Jesuit went to Pioneer Courthouse Square to see The Goonies yesterday.  Turnout was great, the crowd ran the gamut from the hiphop crowd to goths.  All united by loving the phrase 'hey you guys.'  Proving The Goonies is one of the greatest movies of alltime.
The four horsemen are assembled and the charge will begin.  The charge to retake the internet from the disgusting hands of the pornographers and return to where it rightfully belongs, the hands of teenage boys.  Beginning today, the horsemen will begin the most difficult, the most dangerous task ever placed upon any humans in history of mankind.  We will build up our readership, convincing people worldwide that our blog is more interesting than porn.  They will fight us, sending hitwomen with huge breasts after us (they will be easy to spot, beautiful women don't associate with the horsemen), but we will persevere.  One day, one glorious day, our site will have more visitors than all the porn in all the world.  Impossible, you say.  We don't listen to such words here.  We horsemen believe in the the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.  It eluded us then, but that's no matter--  Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....  And one fine morning---        So we beat on, boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past.
So this morning, I kinda forgot that I had no football today.  Which isn't very surpising, since I have it like every day except sunday for the next 80 months.  Or something.  But so I not only forgot that I had no football, but also forgot what time the football I didn't have was at.  This was an unbearable state of affairs, I assure you.  I attempted a mad dash up the stairs only to be brought startlingly short by the fact that my legs didn't want to listen to me.  They decided to listen to someone else, someone completely unrelated to me and also quite invisible, who told them their time would be much better spent by spasming out.  After all, what legs wouldn't want to just sorta quiver on the floor instead of actually sprinting?   This bodily mutany forced me to rely upon my trusty (and much more loyal) arms for my transportation out of my basement lair.  All went well until I came to the door.  Ever tried opening a door at the top of some stairs without being able to use your legs?  It was quite tricky...in the end, I propped myself against it, leaned hard, then managed to stroke the handle enough for it to somehow pop open.  Victory at last!   But with only one small problem...my football schedule is on the fridge.  High up on the fridge.  At what is normally eye level for my towering 6'2' frame.  Having your eyes reduced to midgethood (at only 6' off the ground, I was small even for one of the little people) makes it rather difficult to read things on the fridge 6 feet above your head.  Well, reading things 6 feet above your head on the fridge when they were made in point 12 font is always hard, its just most people don't have 12 foot fridges with football schedules on them, so I don't run into this problem every day.  Again, my brilliant mind came to the rescue.  STOOLS!  No, not the kind you leave in the toilette or some turncoat mafia member (both of which have about the same smell, slimy skin, and high value on the street) but the wooden kind you normally would perch upon to dine at my luxerious countertop in the kitchen.  With two of them placed the appropriate distance apart, I was easily able to lift myself up onto a sitting position upon a third.  It was kinda like doing a really monsterous dip, only with dogs staring in shock and my legs still doing their own little dance.  From this high and mighty vantage point I was shocked to assertain that practice had started a good hour ago.  But wait, my mind screamed, today could not be the 23rd!  It simply couldn't!  I hadn't watched Casablanca yet, and I absolutely knew it was due by the 23rd!  Faced with this cold, unforgiving logic, my brain was forced to admit, that no, today probably wasn't the 23rd.  Furthermore, the phoney thing clearly said it was the 20th.  But that couldn't be either, could it?  There was no football practice on the 20th...and if there was no practice, there was no reason for my legs to be so badly misbehaving, nor for me to have to crawl upstairs to check when practice started.     At this point, my legs decided the invisible stranger had led them astray from the True Path which is a body part's only real hope to enter the Divine Heaven that is Sitting On A Lazy Boy With A Giant Glass Of Iced Lemonade Watching Bond Movie And Eating Ribs.  Of course, my legs have never (and if I have any say in it, WILL never) eaten a rib, drunk lemonade, or even seen James Bond.  However, they understand that this is a blissful state, and they certainly enjoy sitting in a Lazy Boy more than running.  This leads them to beleive that this Divine Heaven must be a nice place to be, and hey, everyone else seems excited about it, so why shouldn't they? This allowed me to return my arms to their normal role of hanging at my sides and occasionally turning doornobs and reaching for remotes and lightswitches.  I decided the ordeal meant my entire body deserved a dip in the Semi-Divine Heaven that is a Warm Bath With Lots Of Bubbles And Soothing Music And Smelling Salts.  Though I was pretty sure I was out of smelling salts, I figured I could fake my nose out with with some fragrant bubble stuff.  Or maybe a nice candle.  I again had to face a flight of stairs to obtain my goal, but for this one I could asend as humans do, and not the humans who have paralyzing back injuries and no elevators or kind people to carry them.  However, as I walked past my front door, I looked out the window.  Through that window, I could see inside my car.  And through that window letting me see inside my car, I could see throught the window going out of my car.  And throught that window going out of my car I could see into my neighbor's window across the street.  And through THAT window across the street I beheld a strange sight indeed.   For my 19 year old blonde streetmate was dancing some sort of weird macarana-like dance.  And here I thought she'd already left for college, or at least moved in with some 24 year old hippie.  Wow.  People really should shut their blinds once in a while.  I'm not one to talk, though.  There are no blinds on the glass door in my basement.  And I love dancing around in my skivies down there.  But no one's dumb enough to risk peering through MY windows.  Are they?
urlLink    But what *did* they want?
Could my fellow horsemen copy some of my interests? I keep clicking them and realizing that I'm alone... so alone...  Don't tell me you don't like a good hunk of man-liver every once in a while.
which took more guts than it really should've.  See, usually I think of myself as someone who's not afraid of anything--who'll try anything once as long as there's a reasonable chance of survival.  (It's not that I'm AFRAID of dying, it's more that I don't want to inconvenience God by making Him resurrect me so I can be Ultimate King of All That Surrounds Me.)  Anyway, I call, heart beating audibly.  Ring... ring... then, '...WHAT?'  In this age of caller ID, what can I conclude but that I really, really pissed her off, just by calling?  But I pretend that all is not lost.  'Uh, hey there!  How's it going?'  And it isn't!  'OH! Ken! Sorry, I thought you were my mom!'  Hmmmmm.  One more reason to earn that manly Eagle Scout award.  If this supernatural maternal reminder didn't happen so often, it wouldn't bother me that much, but...  I mean, I wasn't even planning on being a stay-at-home DAD, let alone Mom.  But it's okay.  Now I'm waiting for her to call back, thinking, 'Hey, it could have gone worse,' then asking myself, 'Why do you even care?'  Honestly, I don't know.  Just don't know.  School hasn't started yet and I haven't seen her for over two months.  Shouldn't that have been cathartic?  So far it's been as cathartic as being anally probed by extraterrestrials that only measure the charge capacity of your nether regions--with a cattle prod.  BZZZZZZT!  Every day.  That prod doesn't even fit (please don't think about that).  And I'm left where I used to be--thinking, 'boy, I wish I was over this,' and then thinking, 'wait, no, what I really want is for everything to work out,' and then, 'man, I could really use some kind of legal nerve stimulant so I can stop being tired all the time.'  Hey, as long as it's not a cattle prod.  It might damage the cell phone--and then how would she call back?
The anticipation for Ken's first post is killing me.  If you've read his 'about me' you know its going to fucking rock.  I'm sure he's putting the finishing touches on it as I type.  Meanwhile, John participating in conditioning week for football, so we're going to give his absence the benefit of the doubt.  So it looks like Miguel is the only horseman who pulled through for me.  He did a great job; I can't wait for another post.
This is a shout out to our only reader, Shakeer.  Without him the blog would be 89% worse.  If you are offended because you also read this blog and you want a shout out, leave a damn comment once and a while.  I know its only been six days, but I was counting on the million monkeys on a million computers thing.  And its been a big disappointment.
For the last two weeks I have really been looking forward to this weekend because there is a dodgeball tournament at a high school near my house.  Dodgeball is my favorite sport and I was brimming with anticipation over assembling and leading a team of friends into such a glorious competition.  As I was ironing out the details I clicked on the waiver because I had to read it.  No one over 18.  I am 18 in less than a month.  Their unequitable line in the sand crushed my soul, telling me I am not worthy to play in their league. I'll tell you what.  They will rue the day they excluded me.  I will train harder than anyone has ever trained for anything.  I will make Rocky's training in Siberia in Rocky IV seem like a walk in the park.  And next year, when they come back to Portland from their pansy headquarters in Los Angeles, I will tear the Beaver Ball trophy from their well moistuized hands and my triumph will be sung throughout the ages by all people of all walks of life who need the inspiration of heroes to continue their own heroic existence.
I would normally put this in the comments section, but my esteemed colleague forgot to utilize that tool.  From my brief study of Sigmund Freud, I have formulated a belief that the real object of the punk anger is their small genitalia.  Besides the obvious implications that go with that territoty there is also a reduced testosterone level which prevents said punks from being successful at manly endeavors such as sports.  This coupled with their subpar intelligence leaves them little option but 'reject' the society that in fact rejected them first.
Me being me, take my posts with a grain of salt. I do not mean to offend. Most people.  It pisses me off how many people are posers and cannot accept it. I'm a poser. I live with this knowledge. I consider it one of the many marks that I, too, am human and possess original sin. But I suffer through the insufficiency. But man, some people...  For instance, it has come to my attention that to be a punk you must fulfill a minimum three requirements:  1) Be angry. It doesn't matter what you're angry at. But you must have a perpetual simmering rage in the bowels of your soul, stewing and propelling you to speak out. Express your anger with everyone, from the people who you deem responsible to the random passerby who will raise an eyebrow and probably regard you with disdain. Note that this in turn will make you angry at the random passerby as well, because they're only kindling the source of your anger. The source of your anger does not matter. It can change at any time for any reason if necessary to keep it going...or just because you feel like it.  2) Be ugly. It is vital to the punk mindset to go against everything that is natural to the human body. Dying one's hair many colors one cannot find in any of the nooks and crannies of nature is heartily recommended. Do this frequently. Also, dessacrate the human body as much as possible with tatooes spreading across from the tips of your fingers to the small of your back to the metatarsal area. Oh, not to mention body piercings. How better to express the anger you have against your father, your life, the Man, the cat next door, and your personal hygiene appliances than by showing that you don't care what they think? And body piercings are a great way to do that. Pierce several parts of your body, be creative, and remember: if you don't go through the metal detectors at least five times, you are not carrying enough representation of your flesh mutilation.  3) This one kind of leads into the other two. Be rebellious. As with anger, it does not matter. Do not accept anything except your own beliefs to be true. Your beliefs consist of everyone else being judgmental. And that life is unfair. You should never conform. Ever. In fact, if you are reading this now, you are submitting to corporate America by paying your electric bill or even just using a computer. Dell is laughing at you, and dead punk artists are rolling in their graves.  Very few self-proclaimed 'punks' have ever really fulfilled these requirements. ...     The actual point of this post was that I hate Good Charlotte, who whines about everything in life even though they have millions of dollars, are now LIVING the lifestyles of the rich and the famous, whine about not wanting a 9-5 and how the lead singer's dad is an asshole in approximately 40 of their 41 songs....yeah.  Sorry to bash on Good Charlotte fans...but if that last paragraph offended you, bite me.  Actually, the only people I hold in any remote form of disdain are the actual hardcore punks. Granted I shouldn't judge folks before I know them...but always being wrong is kind of a deterrent from talking to people.  So in reality, I like posers more.
As you can see, Ken has joined and Mike and John will soon follow.  And a golden age will begin.  We will turn a corner.  We will believe in science.  We'll work just as hard for your jobs as we work for our own.  Terrorism will lose and we will win because the future doesn't belong to fear, it belongs to hope.
This blog has had technical difficulties for the past few days, but they are now sorted out so we shall soon have two of the three new bloggers posting.  Which brings me to reveal something to you.  Why, you may ask, did this moron post by himself on this blog until he had it all figured out?  It seems like the gimmick is that there are four equally important bloggers and by doing this he just created an antipathy towards him by posting subpar material.  Well you would be correct.  I am a dumbass.  I wanted to have a few posts grounded in to assert my feeble personality before my friends amaze you with theirs.  I envisioned my posts as something endearing, like watching a newborn foal struggling to walk.  But it was probably just pathetic, like a foal born with three legs struggling to walk, while you know it never will.
A short public service announcent.  Coming back from a short campout and reviewing this blog and another that I frequent, I realized that the title of my last post is the same as the other blog's only I added an exclamation point.  I am certain that I subconsciously stole it.  I feel like scum.
I recently got a brand new kickball.  I bought one from Target about two weeks ago.  I really liked it.  My brother and I took it in the street in front of my house.  He pitched it to me.  I kicked it farther than I have ever kicked a kickball in my life.  Once we retrieved it I decided to be safe, take it inside, and wait until my next kickball game to experience the ecstasy of kicking this ball.  But wait.  My brother was inside our yard.  I decided to see how far it would drop kick.  Enormous mistake.  I am not a good drop kicker under the best of circumstances and here I was trying to kick super hard.  The kick sucked and it rolled right into my neighbor's only rose bush.  A terrible thing.  Now, I know there are a lot of awful things in our world, things a billion times worse than losing a stupid kickball.  But, since I do not possess an incredible emotional maturity, I mourned its passing.  This mopiness lasted a week.  The day we were set to go camping (which I did not want to do), I was surprised by a new ball.  A better ball.  One that came in a box like a basketball.  And cost twice as much.  It is a wonderful ball.  I love it.  Don't judge me.
Not about the music.  About the politics.  Shame on me but I have to write this while its still fresh in my mind.  I went to the Kerry rally at Waterfront Park.  I downloaded the tickets last night and went with my dad this morning.  The gates opened at 10:00 and he was supposed to arrive about 12:15 so I figured I would get there at about 10:30, wait at the gate, and do a crossword for two hours.  I knew a lot of people would be there, but I was not prepared for this.  We got there on schedule but there were lines everywhere.  We were at the back of a line the stretched for at least a quarter mile.  I thought it must be for people who didn't have real tickets.  (If you haven't figured out by now, I'm a dumbass.)  So we crossed the street and found a much shorter line but which turned out to be for vets.  When we got back to the original line, the end was on the opposite side of the builiding we were at originally.            While waiting there were dozens of solicitors for various causes.  And protesters.  But not very many.  A couple of guys had the usual Jesus Saves From Hell stuff and were telling us to repent from our wicked ways.  One was a real loudmouth and said some of the most stupid but funniest things I have ever heard.  One particularly trifecta of irony was the fact that his sign said Bush defends America and had pictures of various military icons, then he said Bush was intelligent enough to stay out of Vietnam, just like him (the speaker), and then he went on to talk about how they were both manly men and thats why liberal women didn't like them.  After this an astute citizen asked him if he knew Bush was a cheerleader in college.  Silence.  Then he said 'Really?'  Everyone said yes and then the moron mumbled that he wasn't really into politics.  He was a goldmine.          It took about an hour and a half to go the quarter mile and by the time we were at the verge of the security checkpoint the police decided that the remaining thousands would be so far away they couldn't do anything even if they wanted to.  They didn't even check the tickets.  We ended up, after a fire marshal fence was torn down, about three football fields away from the stage and Jon Bon Jovi.  He was okay, had a lot of emotion and some intelligent things to say.  Then the usual lame people that nobody cares about started talking and it got really boring until six buses came off the bridge behind us and drove to the side of the rally.  Everyone got really excited but nothing happened.  More talking.  Then three (more?) buses drove by and the buzz was back.  Finally, squinting I could see him emerge on stage.  He shook hands, reminding the unlucky majority of the over 30,000 how far away we were.  Then his wife spoke.  For a long time.  She was nice but spoke slowly, almost casually and kind of repeat repeated herself.  Then Jim Rassman came on and was pretty good.  But the crowd was yearning for Kerry.  And he delivered.  And it wasn't just his acceptance speech from the convention.  He had particulars.  Plans that made a lot of sense.  It was great.  Unfortunately I had to leave early to get to work.  I only missed about 3 minutes.  I'm glad I went.  I'm sorry that was so long.  Believe it or not, but it was edited for length.  I left a lot of good stuff out.
The free iTunes song this week is good.  Good enough to make you download iTunes if you don't already have it.  An Irish guy under the pseudonym Simple Kid.  I heard him on some late night show a long time ago but I can't remember which.  Anyway, I like it.  He might be huge later and you will want to have said you heard him when he was a small fry.  His first CD is coming out soon.  So tell me either way.  If there's anybody out there.
Spock would be a Democrat.  I am not a Trekkie but I have seen a few episodes and movies and the phrase 'The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.' stuck out in my liberal mind.  Republicans believe in individual responsibility, and I am all for that, but a society like ours will always have people who for a myriad of reasons cannot support themselves without considerable help.  And if that requires taxing the billionaire citizens of our country (there are more than you think) a few percentage points more, than Spock and I would say it is the right thing for us and the exorbitantly wealthy to do.    No more political articles for a week.  I apologize.
Just writing to explain the title. Once I figure out how to do it, three of my friend will join the blog.  I promise they are more interesting then I am.
This is not your father's blog.  (I have yet to impregnate anyone, so don't come to me trying to get child support for your sorry ass.)  This blog will usher in a new day.  A day of sincere, honest, and powerful writing.  Writing of real people, for real people, and by real people.  Or it will suck and wallow in the mediocrity of almost every other blog out there.  But you can only find out if you read it.
When I went to do a little digging into the root causes of jealousy as a phenomenon that occurs in more humans (and within ourselves) more times than we care to admit, I was surprised to find the word âloveâ absent from any arguments and theories attempting to explain the emotion. I use the word âemotionâ loosely here, because the act or feeling of jealousy is really a complex combination of many elemental emotions- primarily fear, anger, loss, the need to be validated, the need for attention, and so on.   There are so many theories as to the roots of the matter, and all valid in their own rights, that itâs hard to focus on just one or two. However, in this post, I have decided to stay within my own experiences, and elaborate on two theories- historical and developmental.   The first talks about how insecurity within a relationship is, to a certain extent, built into our psyche from the get-go. From a female point of view, since males can procreate with any number of partners, and at a much higher rate simply by inseminating multiple females, while women can procreate only a certain amount of times, and with only one partner at a time, they have much more invested in their offspring. Hence, they are keener on keeping track on whither and when their chosen partners stray, and have an active interest in keeping that straying to a minimum.   In the case of the male of the species, since they can not procreate on their own, rely on the females to do so on their behalf, the threat of the genetic bond between a father and his offspring is by definition, doubtful because of the femaleâs ability to have extra-dyadic relationships. Neither gender is so strongly bonded to the other without the volatile concept of âloveâ, that there is no possibility of doubt in the relationship.  Another train of thought explores how infants, particularly those with a high level of imagination and hyperactivity are prone to disregarding the possibility that their caretakers have a life outside of the relationship shared between them. The children that, as they mature, realize that their guardians have relationships, interests and activities in their lives that are completely removed from their wards, usually tend to be less insecure through adolescence and adulthood. However, those that canât accept that fact, tend to surround themselves in these fantasies wherein the child is singularly important to the caretaker, and most often, in cases where the caretaker tolerates these fantasies, as the child matures, these fantasies not only grow in intensity, but they are also transferred to others in his/her range of vision. Here, the child goes to the extreme of attempting to destroy the connections and thoughts of the caretaker that do not pertain to the child and its interests.   The extreme of this phenomenon leads to the child (and the adult) becoming unable to make the distinction between attacking the ideas of those it cares about having outside relationships and interests, and attacking the subject of its jealousy.   Another reaction that the subject has when affected in this manner is the development of a strong vigilance in monitoring their partnerâs behaviour, their actions and interactions. Stemming from their own feelings of inadequacy, fear of rejection and abandonment, they tend to take a more than healthy interest in the comings and goings of their partners, believing that the partner should be responsible to them in all respects of their existence. No action should be taken that is perceived as unnecessary or âwrongâ in their eyes of the subject. This is especially important when it comes to outside relationships between the partner and those of the opposite sex. The subject translates all their feelings into the conviction that the partner (or the friends) are sexually attracted (to their partner), and are actively making advances on them in their (the subjectâs) absence.   In my own experience, the second theory holds true. In a fit of bad judgment, I spent a fairly large portion of time pandering to what I knew were unhealthy and unreasonable requests by this person I was involved with, and ended up losing a lot more than I had gained from the relationship. Receiving neither comfort nor support through that period of my life, I found myself constantly having to explain my actions to this man, having to give up on external relationships that meant a lot to me, and at the same time, watching as every request granted turn into another, more unreasonable one. The tendency toward violence was present also, and though never brought to fruition, was a definite threat, and ultimately what ended the relationship.   Upon discussion with a psychologist (namely, my mother) I found that this problem of insecurity was caused in a large part by his feelings of inadequacy, that he felt that he was unable to be loved, appreciated or admired. He would go out of his way to point out his fallacies, and then demand to know whether I still loved him. Eventually, I realized I didnât. Entirely too much of his own life and how he looked at himself was dependent on how much I was willing to give up for him, it almost got to a point where if I wasnât willing to give in, then the relationship wasnât working, or there was something wrong with me, which lead to the conclusion that I must be cheating on him somehow.   What is possibly the most discouraging fact is that these issues are most often so deeply indoctrinated within a personâs psyche, that it is virtually impossible to conquer them. Most people live their entire lives in this manner, and their partners (especially those that donât have this problem) have a hell of a time dealing with it. The same fights will happen, and more so in a long term relationship, the more secure of the duo will end up sacrificing relationships and external interests in order to keep the peace.  The more insecure of the pair, possibly due to these problems, tends to be the more aggressive of the two, and the cycle continues- where at first it was the caretaker pandering to the childâs fantasies, now it is the partner. The problem is that, especially in Indian households, where the woman is still to be the submissive of the two, an insecure male dominates her life, and since she is expected to acquiesce, her life becomes meaningless outside of serving him and his needs. There is no way to break this cycle however, without extensive counseling, and frankly, Iâm yet to encounter someone taking themselves to a shrink to get over being jealous, at least of their own accord.   As for me, Iâm just beyond relieved that Iâm not in one of those situations any more, and as wonderful and philanthropic the idea of 'saving' or 'helping' someone is, I ain't got the patience.
There is a school of thought that claims that human beings are separated from animals by our ability to control instinct, for without self-control we're just smarter monkeys. This of course, is bullshit. Instinct cannot be controlled by definition. That is not to say that trained thought and concentration cannot take remedial action, but rather that we will do what instinct forces us to before our brain can control it. How many times has somebody thrust their hand up close to your face to make you blink? Even if you know that its coming you can't stop your reaction. It can be pretty annoying.   A lot of emotion has to do with instinct. Noone teaches you how to feel sad or happy, its built in. In our capitalistic modern world we place heavy stress on individuality, creativity and emotion. We even aggrandize emotion and say that it is the root of our humanity. The difference between us and animals.   The contradiction is obvious, if you're willing to believe that all emotion is based on instinct, but perhaps there is room for a hybrid of these two viewpoints.   Of all the emotions we have, and it is a fairly extensive repertoire, I'd have to say jealousy is one of the least controllable of all. It is intertwined with desire, another fairly strong emotion which makes it even more potent. Intelligent people turn into blithering idiots, people that have it all 'together' become barely recognizable contortions of themselves. I think its fair to say  everyone  feels jealousy at some point or the other, the thing that differs is how they handle it. How much control their will can exert over it.   In my personal experience I can control it almost everytime. I feel it but don't mention it and don't take action upon it. Alas not everyone has my iron mental grip on their emotions. I've been on the receiving end of jealousy more times than I can count and it has not been pretty. That's not to say I didn't like it.  While it is a destructive force in a relationship there is a kind of solace in it. At least the other person cares enough to get jealous in the first place, right? I know a lot of women that use jealousy as a kind of 'love yardstick'. The more jealous a man gets, the more he loves you. Of course, they bitch and moan about it but the bottom-line is that you need jealousy. Jealousy is like this ultimate form of flattery: it means this person desires you in the basest, the rawest of all human emotion. I would be lying if I said I didn't like to see a little jealousy in my significant other.   My lack of jealous displays has raised a few eyebrows in the past. Like some freak people point and stare at. 'Your girlfriend has been talking to that guy all night! Aren't you going to say something?'. It finally boiled over one day and I had to explain the fact that I did feel it, I was just good at not showing it. So now there's this new rule. I don't mention it right away but rather on the way back home. Something like: 'You know when that guy gave you a big hug hello? Yeah I felt a little jealousy back there'. And we're all good.   In my opinion, it is the instinctive nature of the emotion that causes this behaviour. We  need  to see jealousy to prop up our egos and give us that lovin' feeling. Its stupid, its irrational, its illogical and we love it. As long as you get some balance of control and instinct going you can use jealousy as a method of both measuring and maintaining a healthy relationship.
My technologically retarded brain finally realised that I had blocked the Blogger.com cookies ages ago. So. Here I am. And the champagne's on ice.
Pillowmint is a collaboration Blog between Vishal Parpia and Roma Ebrahim. We plan on covering a range of topics and making lots and lots of politically incorrect statements.
I'm not exactly holding the fort either, work has exploded into a hideous cocktail of 30 different things that need my immediate attention. I'm afraid that more interesting things like this blog will need to take a back seat but fear not, we shall return. And we shall kick much ass.
My deepest apologies for being so neglectful to the baby. I've been totally overwhelmed on various fronts, including personal, professional and educational.  Most recently, I've been told, with much delight from my sadistic genius of a 'Competitive and Strategic Analysis' professor that I have to come up with an analysis technique all by my retarded little self. On Marketing Warfare, no less. What the hell do I know about developing strategic analysis techniques? Zip-a-doodle, that's what.  I have a week before I need to submit this. My middle name should be procrastination. Followed by misery. And insommnia. And caffiene. And neck-muscle spasms.  Roma Procrastination Misery Insommnia Caffiene de la Neck-Spasm Ebrahim.
Saw this  urlLink Interview with writer Karey KirkPatrick  on  urlLink Slashdot  who is the screenwriter for the movie. I hope he doesn't screw it up. Seems a nice enough chap and I did like Chicken Run. I have recently gained faith in the Hollywood writing/directing process because I thought The Lord of the Rings was genuinely good. As were a lot of the Superhero adaptations I've seen.   This is a completely different cup of tea though. Best of luck to him. I wouldn't want his job.
Finally got these suckers working. You do need to define the control that needs to be validated before hand. After that it works like a charm. Probably the biggest time saving feature I've seen in .Net so far.
I like the fact that they killed the President.   Why is it that the Vice President is always the asshole though? Is it impossible for a movie to depict the President as being an asshole? I mean we know they are assholes, the present one being the case in point. At least the President in the movie seemed to be an idiot. Very realistic on that score.   Dennis Quaid is an idiot too. Believable as a rugged arctic adventurer, harder to believe as a real human being.  I just hate the way he acts. I think he is a boring person in real life.   Other than that, I thought the movie was great. It's always nice to see stuff blow up. The scene in LA with multiple twisters was awesome. That and the waves of the sea frozen so it looks almost like a desert. Isn't there some saying about the desert being the sea of the land... Or something equally paradoxical? Donnie Darko is in it which was weird but added to the endearment factor. What the hell is his real name anyway?  urlLink Jake Gyllenhaal  is Donnie Darko, IMDB owns your ass.  Well worth my Rs. 150. I might even pick up the DVD.
Been messing about with ASP.Net and was having trouble getting CustomValidators to work correctly. I wanted Server Side validation for a Username (check to make sure that the username does not exist). I got it to the point where it comes back if an error occurs without writing to the database but it didn't display the error. Found this page:  urlLink 4 Guys from Rolla  that provided an easy server side only example. Still didn't fix why my message wasn't being displayed though. I think it has something to do with setting the controls to validate at design time in the design window. I am currently setting those properties at runtime through a function. Lets see how it goes when I switch that.
Hey everyone out there. Finally got around to setting up the site on Ron's server. Blogger does a nice job of ftping and keeping everything looking good. Look forward to more words of (questionable) wisdom in the coming weeks.
I just got done reading this article:  urlLink Eurogamer.net - Microsoft set to offer XNA technology to consumer electronics rivals . This is the right way to go about it. If you're making games today the hardest choice is having to pick a platform or pay out the waazoo for a piece of the other hardware manufacturer's pie. XNA might just be a the best way to go about it. I'd love to have a competing open source standard (As OpenGL is to DirectX) but I think it takes somebody with the muscle to put out it's own console that will be able to drive adoption. If the Phantom guys at  urlLink Infinim  want to survive they'd be jumping on this bandwagon as soon as they find the trail.   I was concerned with the reference to movies and about how it is the 'perfect analogy'. Firstly both movies and music are far less complicated technologically when compared to games. There is a 'right way' to see a movie. It scales down to a smaller screen, the sound drops from Dolby Digital whatever to mono as required but as long as you're capable of churning out upwards of 30 fps you can play a movie. There is also a 'right way' to play a game. It needs to be played on the platform it was designed for. You can't expect a game written for a PC to work on a handheld. That means theres a hell of a lot more work involved in making games as flexible as movies. That little handheld can't possibly have enough juice to play your game as well as a PC could. You'd end up making an entirely new game, oftentimes sans 3D for that mobile platform. How is that the same as movies? The PSP will play your movie, the iPod will play your MP3. I think it's an oversimplification to believe that the game will work perfectly on so many platforms just because it uses XNA. Games are not as simple as movies. At best it is an analogy that falls apart at the end. XNA has the right idea, but it's going to take something special from Microsoft.
With much pomp and fanfare,  urlLink pillowmint  has been launched. Stop by for completely conflicting opinions on inconsequential topics. Suggestions for new topics are always welcome.
I don't even have to say what the fuck. It is implied. Read this  urlLink press release  at Gotham Comics and you'll understand what has got me to this point of pure anger. Apparently Peter Parker is now Pavitr Prabhakar.  When I first saw it I thought it was a spoof or something. But this is the Gotham Comics website. It's a goddamn press release. There's some fairly high quality artwork of Spider-man in a fucking dhoti.   Honestly, who the hell are they trying to appeal to? Even the farmers in India have better fashion sense. Look at the shoes!  Someone has completely lost their minds. They call it transcreation. I call it crap.
Finally, the LZW compression patent runs out and Unisys doesn't get it's grubby paws on money for every single application that uses GIF compression. The  urlLink Unisys Website  has some more details about the whole thing. But really, at least open source software can build in the damned thing to distribution binaries instead of making me rebuild it with some obscure switch turned on.
This one's for you:  urlLink Jeffrey Zeldman Presents: The Ad Graveyard . Thought you'd get a kick out of it.
I'm new to the blogosphere. I knew it existed, frequented a few blogs here and there and never thought about setting up my own. Which is rather weird, now that I think about it, since I'm all for trying out new stuff. Anyway, the reason I finally got involved was because I read a blog with a beautiful design, actually it was this very template.   As a web developer by profession I was naturally attracted to the simplicity of a page that lost none of it's beauty because it didn't have aqua buttons or flash or javascript trickery. I had no idea what I was getting into when I right clicked to view source. It was nothing short of a revelation.   Nestled comfortably in this elegantly coded html file was nothing whatsoever. That is to say there wasn't the stuff I expected to see. Instead of the nested tables and IE/Netscape hacks with indentation from hell I saw no content formatting code at all. The content was there in simple &lt;div&gt;s and &lt;p&gt;s but that was all.   They had managed the holy grail of web design: Separation of content from formatting. CSS is finally living up to it's promise.  Now I'm not an idiot. I know what CSS can do, hell I use CSS on every site I make. I just didn't know how far people had managed to get it to go. There were always compatibility issues, unsupported properties and a plethora of other problems that had no solution.   Things have moved on since the last time I looked. I've been gobbling up information on the new way of doing things.  urlLink A list apart ,  urlLink CSS Zen Garden  and  urlLink Douglas Bowman's Stopdesign  (he's the guy that made the template I'm using and redesigned Blogger) have all been incredibly useful resources. Needless to say I'm moving  urlLink ActivElement 's site to this kind of separation and all new projects will use this method alone. To hell with Netscape 4.  Job #1 is to redo  urlLink my home page  with pure CSS. It should then be relatively simple to get this blog to match.
This is one of those 'Why didn't I think of that?' sites.  urlLink BugMeNot.com  offers logins for all those sources of information that require registration now. Brilliant idea. Add to favorites for sure.
There are those that have so little faith in the American judicial system that they think SCO actually has a case. I beg to differ. This is a company that have been duped by their lawyers into believing they can win this thing.    urlLink Groklaw  has a write up on Judge Kimball kicking the case out and giving SCO 30 days to make good. The odds of SCO making good are slim at best.   It is almost comical to see SCO play the bad guy trying to get money from people giving software away. Linux is obviously the good guy, grassroots movement, everything for free, tree-hugging hippie of the software world. As with any good hollywood movie, the bad guy gets what's coming to him and the good guy gets the girl... which in this case is probably more market share.   This entire fiasco can only make Linux stronger. It's like a huge PR exercise to prove to people that the Linux code is not only utterly free (because the copyright holders have chosen to release it under the GPL), but that it is so good that SCO, the makers of UNIX, think it has to be a rip-off of their operating system. I can think of no higher praise.  SCO are done for. To all you SCO stock holders, a word of advice: Eat the loss and sell now. It will only get worse.
Holy moly! I have got to get me one of  urlLink these !
As usual, Robert Cringely manages to blow away everyone by seeing something where others don't. The man is remarkably perceptive and, perhaps more importantly, is capable of delivering his message to enough people thanks to PBS and his geeky fame.  urlLink Engines of Change  is just another great piece of thinking. Everyone knows the technology exists, he just plugs enough of it together to make something completely different happen.   What I want to see (and haven't seen yet) is a cheap IP phone that uses WiFi. It only needs 802.11b but needs to be in the approximate price range of the Nokia 3310. Now that would make me a rich man.
Been busy redesigning my  urlLink website . Here's a sneak peek at the graphics I plan on using there:     Hopefully this one will get completed. The old one was under construction for an obscene amount of time.
Wow. Look at this:  urlLink Forbes.com: Trio to combine cell and wireless LANs . Sure it only works on Avaya Access Points right now but holy crap this is EXACTLY what I mentioned earlier. Can't wait to see this technology proliferate. The end is nigh for the phone companies.
One of the most irritating and arcane aspects of the internet has always been the slow propagation of DNS records. Well for the first time in memory  urlLink VeriSign  have done  urlLink something good .   This couldn't come at a better time for me. I'll be switching all my sites over to my new DNS servers very soon and this just makes it that much less painful. Nice work VeriSign, course you should have done it ages ago.
Saw this on  urlLink Business Week . I think the man raises some valid points. Apple products have long tempted me to switch from the hell that is the PC world but the pricepoint has always been a tad too high. I tend to 'convert' to PC terms and find that I usually get a far better deal.   Of course I'm still waiting for the day that Apple finally decides to release their OS on the PC platform. How I shall enjoy removing Windows from my system. MUHAHAHA!
Well it happened. The whole tournament came full circle and had the same result. What was worse is that from the very beginning it never once looked like Portugal were going to win it.  urlLink ESPNSoccernet.com  has the whole match summary as well as some interesting statistics and things. Should have bet on it. Would have made a packet.
I cleaned the case of my iPod today and was surprised to find that the case had popped out on the side. Now I've dropped it a couple of times by accident but I hadn't noticed the bulge on the side of the metal case. I proceeded to frantically press and pry to get it back in place, but alas, to no avail.   Obviously the next step was to Google for it. No results seemed to match the problem I had. Finally I searched for how to open an iPod thinking that would at least give me a tip as to how to get between the plastic top case and the bottom metal one. Lo and behold this turned up results.   The recommendation was to use thin plastic used in Radio Shack packaging. With no Radio Shack within a 1000 miles of Pune I started hunting around my room for a suitable piece of plastic. I now have the case popped back into place... and the implement used? A rigid strip of cold medication (Cold-Act to be presise).   So now you know. And knowing is half the battle. G.I. Joe Zindabaad.
After a lot of hard work, complicated JS ;-) and some nifty tricks, I have completed the first version of  CFX_JImage Studio  to demo our latest Java Custom tag.  The demo is cross browser (Mozilla and IE) and may (or may not) be slow on your connection.  To check it out, click the button below.  Please send feedback to  urlLink dmackey@gmail.com
Here is something you might enjoy!  To boost our wonderful  CFX_JImage  tag and offer more 'Bang for your buck', we have developed a DHTML interface to the custom tag that people can use to either try the tag out or host online to quickly edit an image file on their server.  The main bulk of the application is complete but there is still a small matter of server-side organisation of files, REDO/UNDO and loading of image files etc         Above is a quick snapshot of what the application looks like. I am currently working on the  Filter Browser  dialog while Peter is tracking down some nasty Java bug that is preventing images that have been read from being released by Java. Looks like in the loading class, the Input file stream isnt being closed properly....  I am most proud of the  Rubber Band  effect used for cropping the image and placing the text for drawing!
Peter is currently packaging up and writing the documentation for our latest CFX release on CFTagStore.com.  This tag rocks! It has various features and enhancements over similar solutions especially the rather cool  cropping  feature. The best part of this tag is the price!  Be sure to check CFTagStore.com and grab a copy of this tag ASAP! :-)  Dan.
About 3 weeks ago, I got an invite to GMail. I singed up and was blown away with the interface and the DHTML etc (Especially the Spell Checking) but didn't really expect myself to use it as I rely heavily on my email account dan@digital-crew.com  But then something strange started happening! I have 3 computers on my desk, my main work PC, an iMac and my laptop.  The laptop is controlled by my Desktop via PCAnywhere (Cuts down on swapping mice and keyboards and is handy for transferring clipboard contents etc)  During my normal day, my Laptop sits there getting my email and its a dog of a laptop now. There are so many apps running as services. I develop on my Desktop.  I now find it easier to use my GMail account to answer tech questions due to the extremely handy feature of grouping all emails together in a  conversation .  Normally, I answer up to 20 emails a day and its time consuming to look for previous emails to refer back to but with this new feature coupled with GTray, I get my email instantly all grouped nicely together!  Google Mail, you are my new best friend!  Dan.
Just finished my latest assigned project for a client bang on time!  The code is safely written to CD and ready for deployment tomorrow.  The project is an Intranet for a newspaper company which will allow storage of important information in a single database and help boost inter-office communication.  The particular project was completed 2 yrs ago but a much needed  CRM  section was required so thats what I have been working on for the last month.       I actually have to admit that its looking savage! Its near perfect on both Mac and PC. Being a newspaper, the Mac was a prerequisit so we had to get an old iMac in to help with compatability. Its amazing how far modern browsers have progressed!  IE5 on Mac sucks!  Dan.
We are always striving to make better applications here at Digital Crew.  Many of these applications, widgets and components make their way onto  urlLink CFTagStore.com  so developers don't have reinvent the wheel when it comes to developing similar pieces of code.  I would like to give some insight into whats in the pipeline here at DC.   TeamWork Intranet   TeamWork Intranet is our main product encompassing all our components and applications into a group-based Intranet Environment. We dedicate Fridays to complete development of the product and are excited about its potential.  For more information :  urlLink www.TeamWorkIntranet.com    CFX_JImage   Peter is currently working on a Java CFX Tag for image manipulation that allows developers to perform a number of editing functions on images right from ColdFusion.  I am currently working on a complimentary DHTML interface to show off its capabilities and its looking damn fine.  Most proud of the  Rubber Band  effect for cropping images. More to come on that....   CFX_JSpell   My own personal delving in Java CFX tags is a GMail type Textarea spell checking component. The DHTML side takes all inspiration from GMail and is compatible with Mozilla and IE.  The server side code (CFX) can be run against a dictionary seperate from our DHTML interface. The Spell Checking Engine being used is Jazzy (Open Source on SourceForge.net)   CFX_JZip   This is an update to a tag I am selling on  urlLink www.CFTagStore.com . The new update will allow the user to  Add  to a zip file aswell as provide a spiffy DHTML interface for manipulating Zip Files.   CFMyAdmin   We are also excited about releasing Version 2.0 of our ColdFusion Based MySQL Database Manager  urlLink www.CFMyAdmin.com   The new version will support Indices, foreign keys and a full user account manager. We are also taking this opportunity to over-haul the data display and entry section.  So, thats a synopsis of whats in the pipeline and to give an oversight of what we're all about coming into the Autumn.  Regards, Dan.
Finally, I have taken the plunge and started a ColdFusion Development Blog on the latest developments in ColdFusion personnally, with Digital Crew and CFTagStore.com  Seeing as this is the first post and I'm trying to work out what the hell is going on with the feeds and everything, I'll keep it short and sweet!  I'll say this though, the Interface for Blogger is savagely good!!  Dan.
Ya know, my boyfriend always tells me how disappointed he is in me for not doing whatever he says at the time. Its mainly going out and drinking for the most part. He is always disappointed that I get tired at 2 am and that I dont stay up with him as late as I do my other friends which is 4 am because I cant get them to leave before then.  He tells me every week how disappointing I am and how predictable I am because I  get tired at the same time, I work a regular work week and do the same things after I get home. He lets me know he doesnt want me.  He doesnt even know he doesn't want me yet. I feel like I am only around until something better comes along. I am the first girl that has never cheated on him and he is disappointed in me all the time.  I am one of the few girls that has not broken up with him and it is almost like he cant break up with me. Sometimes I think he is only with me for the same reason any other person would be and when something better comes along he will be gone.  I cannot give him what he wants because he wants me to be someone else that I am not. He is so busy focusing on what he thinks is wrong with me personally.  I dont see  him saying anything good about me anymore.  I cannot change anymore than I already have. I have done so many changes that were necessary.
Yesterday I went to the Internal Medicine doctor that I have. I have a total of 5 doctors and I am losing 4 out of the 5 when my new insurance switches over. I am bummed about it, but i found out something interesting yesterday at my visit.  All those specialists I have been going to, I could of went to the internal medicine doctor all along. No more psychiatry, dermatology, gastrology, gynocology, and the internal medicine doctor. I am rejoycing. Insurance companies are willing to pay for an internal medicine doctor way over anything else. I am so excited that I will not have millions of appointments all the time anymore. In the last 2 years, I have switched insurance companies 3 times.  It has been a rough ride when it comes to deductables and copays. Hopefully, this new insurance I will be on for awhile so I won't have to deal with this BS anymore.  My new deductable is only 250. The old one is 1,000.  Big difference!
Lately I have become obsessed with a particular musician.&nbsp; I don't really know why. It's not like he's cute or I would want anything to do with him sexually. Its more like a mind pick. He is so strange that I cannot help but to read his words and listen to his music. I look at his art and obsess over the meaning. I obsess over his traumas that have made him who he is. He is so strange that I just want to understand or be able to see through his eyes at things.&nbsp; I wonder why people who they are. I usually attach myself to people who are considered different. This singer is called Marilyn Manson.&nbsp; He's so strange that even his girlfriend(fiance) is a fetish film maker.&nbsp; I don't think shes a porno star, but pretty close. She's even eccentric.&nbsp; I have been reading his book trying to get a better idea, but it only leaves me asking more questions.&nbsp; Kinda like, theres got to be more to it than that.&nbsp; He is such an outcast that he has gathered all the outcasts and made them the majority while everyone else has turned into an outcast.&nbsp; He is one of the most apatheic people I have ever heard of.&nbsp; He writes all this hatred yet he tries to come off as if he doesn't care.&nbsp; I don't get it.&nbsp; Its like an unsolved riddle. Unfortunately, I will never solve this one because he is a human being.&nbsp; Its not like I can actually talk to him and go,'what's going on up in that head of yours to make you so unique?'&nbsp; And even if I could, its not like he can answer a question like that. Who can! I know I cannot about myself.&nbsp; Well I guess I will continue to wrap myself up in his mystery/misery trying to guess what is going on and what is the route cause and why am I so drawn to a tortured soul? I guess one thing about reading that book is it has made him more human. I have stopped having nightmares about him and dreamed more that I was him and can feel what he is feeling emotionally. I play out the scenes in his book in my dreams. I guess that is my own fault since I read it every night before I go to sleep.  In any case, from one person to another, he's pretty different. I respect that.
The most popular religion in America is Christianity.&nbsp; My dad's father was&nbsp;a Baptist Preacher. My dad has always been a little hypocritical to religion. My sister is a bible thumping fanatic. People get so caught up in something to believe in, that no one really stops and thinks about what&nbsp; it can sounds like.&nbsp; To me, the bible,&nbsp; is a bunch of fables that teach moral value.&nbsp; Those people might have existed at some time, but the stories are more like tall tales of what really happened.&nbsp; People don't see the bible as a teaching tool. They see it as a form of reality and a desperate grasp to understand why they are on this earth.&nbsp;  Now, you may get pissed of at my viewpoint. I am not writing on here to piss people off. I just want to talk about things.  To me, my religion is more practical.&nbsp; My God is nature, science and mathmatics.&nbsp; We have no purpose here on earth.&nbsp; We are random acts of chemicals. We are powered by a soul that is energy (electricity). When the energy dissapates, we die and return to our God aka nature, science and mathmatics.&nbsp; We are put into this earth and we are gone. There is no heaven or hell. Just a transfer of energy into a never ending cycle. That cycle will only be broken if one of the energies&nbsp;or chemicals&nbsp;dissapates (sun, gravity, earth, oxygen).&nbsp;  Who each person is, is our nature. Chemicals and matter make up our individual personalities. Personalities and moods can be modified with outside chemicals whether they be illegal drugs or prescribed drugs.&nbsp; I am an example of this. My personality is modified with prescription drugs to make life seem more livable.&nbsp; If our personality is part of our soul, then we shouldn't have any capabilities of modifying who we are with chemicals.&nbsp;  Ghosts to me are natural phenomena when energy is displaced.&nbsp; It might be from a person that was on this earth, but that ghost does not inhabit the personality of the energy's past. Ghosts may be around us all the time. It might be something we electively see from time to time, if at all. When we see these ghosts, we might make them into an image we will understand such as a person we know whom has died.&nbsp; People instinctually force things into categories so they can bear to process the information.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also true that this very thought of ghosts debases the whole heaven and hell theory of Christianity.&nbsp; We can only have one and not the other. What is the answer?&nbsp; Who is right?&nbsp; When you try to make Christianity black and white, you can't. When you take my theory, it seems more plausable and easily transfers over into black and white. You can call my religion Panthiesm if you need the label.
To everyone out there that discriminates, disrespects, and disbelieves mental illness should take the time to understand it first, then make a judgement call.&nbsp; There are a lot of people out in this world that take those mental illness labels and try to fit them into one tightly sealed 'container' filled with the same thing over and over again. People fail to realize those terms are blanketing terms that are very general and non specific to most of the characteristics of the illness. Because of the stigma of mental illness, most Americans after being diagnosed with one, tend to lie about it in the future because they are afraid.&nbsp; They are afraid of losing their jobs, friends, and family. They are afraid that they will be wrongly judged and called psycho or crazy behind their backs.&nbsp; They are afraid that no one will listen to them anymore or think what they say is valid or real. Some people think that mental illness is a joke and a trendy epidemic in America.&nbsp; Some people think that people with mental illness are better off dead.&nbsp; Do you know what I say to these people? FUCK YOU! I was diagnosed initially when i was 16 years old with clinical depression.&nbsp; When I hit 18, i was diagnosed with clinical depression and social anxiety.&nbsp; When I was 20 years old, I was diagnosed bipolar type two and general anxiety. The last diagnosis still stands to this day.&nbsp; A lot of people in this world will look right at me and start trashing someone with a mental illness of a similar label as mine. These people do not know I have those labels as well. I let these people talk, but it makes me steam because of the ignorance of what they are saying.&nbsp; Most people think that mental illness makes you crazy or disabled.&nbsp; My illness sometimes gives me creativity, vision, and the ability to see differently than others.&nbsp; It has made me who I am.&nbsp; Right now, I take medication. I only take it because&nbsp; if I dont, then I stop sleeping very well.&nbsp; I also take medication to make me less filled with stress and tension from&nbsp; being scared.&nbsp; The nature of my disorders are not extreme. They are so mild in nature. I have never been hospitalized or drugged up because I was going to hurt myself.&nbsp; The way a movie portrays mental illness does not help the stigma.&nbsp; You have out there 'Me, Myself, and Irene', 'Girl Interrupted', 'Secret Window', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'A Beautiful Mind', and countless others.&nbsp; They do not shed the light on the reality of what it is, but the extreme nature of what a person can go through if they have it. The majority of this world does not have it extremely bad. And most of those people are never treated.  I found this poem that I relate to. It really touched me and pointed out something about how society is concerning mental illness.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is as follows.    To Be a Mental Patientby Rae Unzicker (1948-2001)   To be a mental patient is to be stigmatized, ostracized, socialized, patronized, psychiatrized.   To be a mental patient is to have everyone controlling your life but you. You're watched by your shrink, your social worker, your friends, your family.&nbsp; And then you're diagnosed as paranoid.  To be a mental patient is to live with the constant threat and possibility of being locked up at any time, for almost any reason.   To be a mental patient is to live on $82 a month in food stamps, which won't let you buy Kleenex to dry your tears.&nbsp; And to watch your shrink come back to his office from lunch, driving a Mercedes Benz.   To be a mental patient is to take drugs that dull your mind, deaden your senses, make you jitter and drool and then you take more drugs to lessen the 'side effects.'   To be a mental patient is to apply for jobs and lie about the last few months or years, because you've been in the hospital, and then you don't get the job anyway because you're a mental patient.&nbsp;  &nbsp;To be a mental patient is not to matter.   To be a mental patient is never to be taken seriously.   To be a mental patient is to be a resident of a ghetto, surrounded by other mental patients who are as scared and hungry and bored and broke as you are.   To be a mental patient is to watch TV and see how violent and dangerous and dumb and incompetent and crazy you are.   To be a mental patient is to be a statistic.   To be a mental patient is to wear a label, and that label never goes away, a label that says little about what you are and even less about who you are.   To be a mental patient is to never to say what you mean, but to sound like you mean what you say.   To be a mental patient is to tell your psychiatrist he's helping you, even if he is not.   To be a mental patient is to act glad when you're sad and calm when you're mad, and to always be 'appropriate.'   To be a mental patient is to participate in stupid groups that call themselves therapy.&nbsp; Music isn't music, its therapy; volleyball isn't sport, it's therapy; sewing is therapy; washing dishes is therapy.&nbsp; Even the air you breathe is therapy and that's called 'the milieu.'   To be a mental patient is not to die, even if you want to -- and not cry, and not hurt, and not be scared, and not be angry, and not be vulnerable, and not to laugh too loud -- because, if you do, you only prove that you are a mental patient even if you are not.  And so you become a no-thing, in a no-world, and you are not.  Rae Unzicker Â© 1984
Ok, I have this awesome computer with a DVD burner +-. It is absolutely the most complex piece of machinery I have ever owned.&nbsp; You can't just copy DVDS. You have to decript them, then you can burn them with Nero. Problem being is you have to have all the correct settings in order for this to work. Also, If your movie needs subtitles, you can just forget about zipping something up to burn.&nbsp; It is a long and complicated process. My friend Jon was over last night working on it for 4 hours.&nbsp; Finally I was like, GO HOME! I am tired!&nbsp; I feel really sleepy today as a result.&nbsp; We didn't even figure out how to burn the subtitles either.&nbsp; I just wanted to sleep for the night. Anyone know how to burn those DVD subtitles? I wish there was an all in one program to do this.&nbsp;
I met Brian in January 2003. We started dating February 4, 2003.&nbsp; He is the longest boyfriend I have had that was not over a distance for some time. We started living together in October 2003.&nbsp; I love him very much. He is my friend, lover, and future husband (Hopefully).&nbsp; I do not want to have children and he does not pressure me to have them.&nbsp; We have our disagreements about something, but they have always seemed to work out. The only thing that hinders our relationship is the fact his parents hate me from the get go. They hate everyone. Brian is really hard up for their approval (which he will never get from anything he does) from them. We fight about his parents more than anything. He still has not told them we live together. He has not spoken to them in almost 7 months.&nbsp; It is a really long time not to speak to your family.&nbsp; I talk to my family about once a week.&nbsp; I think the fact that I wrote them a letter telling his parents how I feel and what they are doing really made Brian mad. Brian cannot stand up for himself&nbsp; or anyone to them. So I stood up for myself. I don't think I did anything wrong except putting things in writing instead of only calling them. Spoken words fade away.&nbsp; Written words people can dwell on their misery. I spoke the truth from my viewpoint.&nbsp; I tried straightening up what they thought about me, but they only made me cry and pushed me away. They are the most miserable people I have ever met in my entire life.&nbsp; Brian tends to get sucked into their misery and believes sometimes it is his fault.  Brian has a hard time with people.&nbsp; He always wants other people's approval for everything.&nbsp; He struggles with this on a daily basis. He suffocates what he really thinks so people will like him.&nbsp; There is a line you draw when it comes to people's approval.&nbsp; I think Brian is willing to cross the line sometimes.&nbsp; He becomes so concerned about what people think of me, that it is irritating. I don't care too much what people think. I have good and bad days and if someone catches me on a bad day, or if I do not like them, I do not hide my feelings.&nbsp; Brian has a hard time with this. He would rather me suck them all in and squash them as he does with his.&nbsp; I think Brian has a lot of growing up to do and a lot of hardening up as well. Brian has never had a job where his life depended on the money. He always had something to prevent that situation. He doesn't understand when I am tired because he can sleep however much he needs. He cannot understand me wanting to sit around because I am never home. He is always at home. He cannot understand that I am around people all the time and need my space. I think all this will change once he finally is completely on his own and working full time to pay off his debts from being in school.  Don't get me wrong, Brian is a wonderful person, but every wonderful person has their flaws.
My new job is great.&nbsp; I stay busy most of the time. The only time I am not busy is on Fridays where no one is here. I have excellent benefits and excellent pay. I enjoy the work I do and I enjoy it when it is complete.&nbsp; I do not mind coming into work every day.&nbsp; I sit right behind my friend Margaret. She is the one that helped me get this position.&nbsp; I have been here for almost a month now. Things couldn't be better.  One thing about this job is I feel it has separated me from my friend Deborah, from my old job. All I can really say is my life is great now, and hers isn't. Her misery does not rub off on me anymore.&nbsp; I think it takes away from some of the common ground we had together. It is tough not to feel like I am bragging about my job when she is around.&nbsp; I do not have any major gripes like I used to with the old position. Misery loves company, and now I am not good company to her.&nbsp; I think she is one of those people that is addicted to misery.&nbsp;  My job is kinda interesting. It can be called a more complex version of Data entry and customer service.&nbsp; I administer a program along with a process that people use to publish new projects.&nbsp; Eventually I will be involved in process improvement.  VW does tuition reimbursement. I am going to go back to school in the Winter for my Masters of Science in Business Information Technology.&nbsp; Hopefully that will put me in line for management positions at VW.  This company is the kind of company I could work for, forever. One condition is that I get better positions as the years pass. Right now VW&nbsp; is ranked 88th best IT place to work in the country voted by ComputerWorld Magazine.  One of the cool benefits is I get is a discount on a vehicle. I am going to lease, and when you lease, they pay for your car insurance.&nbsp; Right now my car is a dump and I cannot wait to get my convertible VW Beetle.&nbsp; I currently have a Beetle, but I have had it for 5 years and it is turning into a pile of junk.  I feel that VW takes care of their employees very well. I feel that they are fair, just employers and I don't think they would allow the things that happend at my old company to occur here. I recommend this place. Its essentially the best place I have worked in my entire life.
I have four cats because.... I am insane?&nbsp; no.... Because I wanted them? partially.&nbsp; Ok here is the story.&nbsp; I have 4 cats because of one cat and a boyfriend who don't get along.&nbsp; Somehow along the way, my precious Winter became terrified of my boyfriend, Brian, after we moved in together.&nbsp; He started shitting in places he wasn't suppose to as well as peeing. It got in his fur, in my closet etc. It made my life hell for 3 months. I had to lock Winter up in a cage.&nbsp; Me and Brian moved into a 2 bedroom apartment in February. Winter got his own room. Winter was still terrified and doing all those bad things even though he could hear Brian but couldn't see him.&nbsp; So, I thought that getting another cat would help.&nbsp; Well, I couldn't find a place who would not call my Landlord about having another cat. So I went to the vet and they were selling 2 cats for the price of one. They were littermates and just under a year old.&nbsp; I took them because I wanted something and if this is all I could get, I would take it.&nbsp;    Winter got immediately better.&nbsp; Brian's attitude towards cats improved by 100%.&nbsp; Then a few months later, I got an email from a friend saying he knew someone who wanted to get rid of their black persian.&nbsp; I couldn't resist since a black persian was my dream cat.&nbsp; Now I have Winter, Midnight, Jasmine and Jayma.&nbsp; My least favorite is Jayma because she beats up the cats to the point where she is vicious. She breaks things and shreds on things. She begs for food all the time.&nbsp; She is annoying. I wouldn't mind getting rid of her.&nbsp; The two kittens are compulsive over eaters.&nbsp; They eat so much that I had to have set feeding times for them. When they don't have food to eat, they like to eat things that are not food and they chew on wires.&nbsp; It is annoying. They are extremely obese. My two persians, Winter and Midnight, are so precious. They play together and have fun. They are so beautiful that it takes my breath away. I really love those two cats alot.&nbsp; I would be torn up if anything ever happend to them.    So that is the story of why I have 4 cats instead of just two.&nbsp;
This is the first use of my new Blog. I hope it is as entertaining as it is thought provoking as I want it to be.&nbsp; I guess I can give a little background information about myself. My name is Breanne. I am 23 years old. I live with my boyfriend, 4 cats, and 1&nbsp;scared beta fish. I just started a month ago at my current job. I work in the Information Technology field. I waited long and hard for a position in IT.    I graduated from&nbsp;college in November of 2002 with a BA. in Computer Information Systems.&nbsp; I tried my hardest from August 2002 to December 2002 to get any permenant job.&nbsp; I had to give up and go to temping. From there is where I worked at several places including the place I am a permanent employee now. I was at VW as a temp then had to leave because they wouldn't hire me perm. I went off to Sho-Link.&nbsp; Who would of thought it would go from bad to much much worse. I never knew a 'Dilbert' office or an 'Office Space' office really would exist.&nbsp;  There I encountered all the things that made a bad business. There was nepotism, favortism, shovanism, sexual harrassment, drug usage, and just plain stupid people.  My first day, I met everyone. I went in there thinking everything will be good and fine.&nbsp; My first day wanted to send me running. They smoked in the office, causing me to get migranes all week. They did take me out to lunch the first two days but the rest of the week I ate alone and from that point on I ate alone because they didn't want me in their clique (3 people were really clique). This girl, Deborah, was the administrative assistant.&nbsp; She seemed loud, angry, and repressed. After me and her were left there at the end of the day while all the higher up people got to leave before 8 hrs was up, she would sit with me and bitch about how horrible the company was. She told me past stories of things that absolutely struck fear into my heart.&nbsp; I would often go home&nbsp; and cry.&nbsp; Her misery spread into my misery.&nbsp; My misery over the next 10 months turned into my own misery, a reality that I couldn't bear.  Jenny, my supervisor, was the dumb blonde that always laughed at what you said yet when you complained, she would brush you off.&nbsp; She talked incessantly about herself and would completely tune out others while she went on and on.&nbsp; All you really had to do was knod and say yes every once in awhile.&nbsp; I started avoiding her after 3 months.&nbsp; Every once in awhile she would corner me in my office and make me talk about something about herself that I didn't give a rats ass about.&nbsp; She didn't give a rats ass about me, so I could hardly care for her.&nbsp;  While I was there I got really sick.&nbsp; The pressures of having to be at the office 40 hrs a week with no leeway was too much. I had a rough February with moving into a new apartment. They weren't particularly fond of anyone taking off work and would talk trash about the person if they were gone.&nbsp; It made me reluctant to be gone. It made me want to be around so they wouldn't gang up on me behind my back.&nbsp; I also attempted to ask if I could leave 30 minutes early for two months so I could take a class, and they said no. I couldn't believe&nbsp;Jenny.&nbsp; Her excuse is she has an office to run, but she is never there.&nbsp; Also, 30 minutes isn't asking for much.&nbsp; At that point, I loathed her.&nbsp; I was determined to leave Sho-Link at this point.  At Sho-Link, I was a CS Rep. There was a girl,&nbsp;Shannon,&nbsp;that had my position before me that worked at one of the other companies we did business with. Ironically enough, not only did they attempt to fire this girl in the past, but recommended her to the other company, Derse.&nbsp; This girl hated me instantly because I had her old position. She tried to make my life hell at that company. And it worked. She got exactly the reaction from Jenny and the president, Alan that she wanted.&nbsp; She constantly was trying to get me in trouble. It first started with her stating I did an order wrong that cost them tons of money. I ended up proving her wrong. Another mistake is one time she called 15 til 5pm and I said, Oh I turned off my computer. Let me turn it back on.&nbsp; That next day I got 'disiplined' by my supervisor, Jenny.&nbsp; I couldn't believe they were making this such a big deal. The things that girl got away with when she worked here were far greater than turning off a computer a little early.&nbsp; She would stretch the truth about me always. She told them I turned off my computer an hour early. It was quite ridiculous. She couldn't prove anything, but I could because Deborah was there.  Another instance with this girl, Shannon was she came to an office baby shower uninvited.&nbsp; Everyone felt really uncomfortable. When she left the room, I said she makes me feel uncomfortable to the VP, Scott.&nbsp; He took this comment, told the president, Alan, and the whole office got in trouble for it.&nbsp; I thought it was insane that everyone got in trouble over that. I had a right to say how I felt in a non-insulting manner.&nbsp; After all the things she had done to me, I had a right to feel SOMETHING.&nbsp;  Sho-Link has a end of the year party every year(its really a Christmas Party). Me and my boyfriend went. My boyfriend that night got totally tanked. While he was dancing with me, he slammed his head into mine, cutting open his skin above his eye.&nbsp; We had to rush him to the emergency room. The VP, Scott, took us there. My boyfriend was puking everywhere and crying. I ended up taking him back to the hotel and I left him for a few minutes. I went up to the Presidents room where they were having a party.&nbsp; Alan attempted to take a cleevage shot of my breasts.&nbsp; I left the room.&nbsp; I was already humiliated enough.&nbsp; I ended up staying up all night cleaning up Brian's vomit.&nbsp; I wanted to never see those people again.&nbsp; When I went to work that next week, they laughed and teased me about it. They said something happens to someone every year. My opinion of the majority of these people was not a good one.&nbsp; I didn't feel any better being compared to someone else at that company.  While I was there, I slowly became good friends with Deborah and Carrie.&nbsp; Deb more than Carrie though.&nbsp; Deborah was really fun to be around.&nbsp; She was smart, inteligent, deligent, and on her way to becoming successful.&nbsp; I clung to her for the only intelligent conversation and common interests we had outside of work.&nbsp; Carrie and I shared an office and became friends in a way that made me learn a lot from her.&nbsp; She made me laugh and was fun to be around.&nbsp; She would talk about anything.  In&nbsp;March of 2004, I received a call from my old friend Margaret at VW. She said they were going to have an open position in her area and I could do that job. She asked if I was interested. I said yes. I wanted out. I never thought it was going to happen. Two months trickled by without a word from anyone. Finally, while searching Monster.com, I saw my job on there!&nbsp; I was outraged, upset, disturbed, and sad.&nbsp; I was passed up again!&nbsp; So, I applied again anyway.&nbsp; A few more weeks goes by and I get called in for an interview.&nbsp; I was nearly jumping out of my skin for weeks. I was so excited. I went to the interview and it was awesome. I did better at that interview than any other one in the past. I was not even nervous.&nbsp; I thought for sure I had this one.&nbsp; At the end of the week, I received a call offering me the job. I was stoked!&nbsp; I put in my two weeks notice the following Monday and here I am.&nbsp; I work at VW&nbsp; in the field of MY CHOICE.
I have come to realize how most of me, is inside my head. I think more internally and hardly ever vocalize what I am thinking. I think what if, if then, type scenarios, act them out in my head and come to a conclusion to what will happen. I realized this because me and Brian were at his friends house and everyone was talking.  I kept dazing off and people wandered what I was thinking.  Most of the time I do not realize I am psycho analyzing a situation until I really stopped to think about it(once again).  It helped me realize who I am more.  I realize now why I am not very articulate.  I am so used to explaining ideas in my head, that I have no practice telling someone else these things, because I miss telling all the links that brought me to the conclusion. I definitely need to work on this attribute because I need to be better at articulating my thoughts at work.  I need to fine tune my words of persuasion and speaking in complete thought processes.  I internalize so much, that I never really realized this part of me. I just expect people to fill in the gaps naturally.  What is so weird is, when I go into myself, it is like the outside of me shuts off and I look blank or angry or sad, when really, I am just somewhere else completely.
I do not know what is with me lately, but everything smells horrible.  I wonder if this is normal. People's body odor, breath, etc are driving me crazy. The smell of skin even. Kinda weird. I also think I imagine some smells.  For example, sometimes when I have gone down on a guy, I think i smell urine or like old cum on them.  It kinda grosses me out.  And I feel like my sensitivity to smell right now is turning me into an ice queen.  Ever notice  how awful sex smells? Ugh, I cannot stand the way it smells. Also, the room that I sleep in smells bad. Me and my boyfriend open a window and it does not help. It has permeated the room. The sheets even smell bad from it along with my boyfriend's clothes that are in there.  It seems like smells are so intense lately. Maybe it is hormonal. Maybe it is because I have all these smelly litter boxes everywhere, so I am constantly bombarded with a horrible smell. Or the fact that my boyfriend doesn't take out the trash enough, so the trash starts smelling.  Maybe it is the fact that my boyfriend also likes to dump food down a drain, and it starts smelling like rot.  Constant exposure to horrible things has probably gotten me oversensitive. You would think I wouldn't smell it after awhile. One time my friend came over and his feet smelled. I felt like it was so strong, I made him bathe his feet.  I couldn't believe I did that. How rude can I get??  LOL.
This weekend was pretty good. Me and Brian had random fights as always. And as always he likes to categorize and assume I will do things because I have done things that way in the past.  It is really frustrating to always be put into the negative that way. His assumptions are negative always.  He never says a good assumption.  He can pretty much give me attitude about everything then reflect how I did something wrong in his eyes, drawing away the critical point of it all. For example: Korn has been calling you way too much dont you think Brian? Reply: Well I only answered because YOU were in your room and I didnt have anything better to do since you were in your room. I was bored.  (AKA my fault).  This stuff gets to me. It irritates me.  At the time I brought this up, I was looking to buy a vacation for the two of us and I just got soured by the reception Brian gave me when I made a comment on how much Korn calls.  It was such a turn off.  But otherwise I had fun. I enjoyed the Symphony (of what little we got to hear since it started raining) and I enjoyed paddle boating (despite Brian's attempts to fill the evening with commentary because he felt uncomfortable in our silence).  People are so strange. We headed over to Christina's afterwards yesterday and when we are about to leave she says she wants us to come over next Saturday.  She gets interrupted, and i say well anyway what were you saying Christina?  She goes oh so you wont come over unless you hear what is going on? I say no, I just wanted you to finish what you had to say.  I hate all these verbal battles. It is such a turnoff.
Today, me and Brian went and got photo's taken. It was really fun. The photographer accused me of practicing.  I honestly just like taking photos. Brian had fun too it seemed.  It was just so cool. Now I have photos to give to my parents and some to put on my desk.  Tonight we are going to the chicago symphony orchestra at Ravina.  We are going to have a picnic and stuff. It will be very romantic. We are celebrating our year and a half together.  It doesn't seem like it could possibly be this long that we been together. We go through alot. We deal with each other alot through many issues.  We are still together though. It amazes me too.  We never have broken up once in all the time we have been together. I guess things work out if it is right.

I just&nbsp;read your comment and I don't understand your comment so I would like you to write another comment to explain your comment. Mmm... I think I have confused myself.    &nbsp;  Who are you angry at-I don't get it.&nbsp; When you read this maybe you could explain furthur (even if you are no longer angry.)    &nbsp;  Think of nice things like bunny rabbits and chocolate oh, and McFly. Try and channel your energy.   I know you won't read this for ages so I'll have to ponder over it myself.   I'll leave you with another question 'If there weren't any people to watch it would the tide still go in and out?' - soooo philosophical.   Love your ever confused friend.
Hello again.    I have just been on holiday. It was alright. We lay on the beaches a lot (when it didn't rain). On Sunday mum had a brainwave and decided that we should all go birdwatching. I wouldn't of minded so much if it hadn't been raining and windy. I mean, if I had wanted to see some birds I could have just looked out of the window in&nbsp;the dry. But, I guess, we had to do the whole&nbsp;'family bonding' thing. Surely there must have been something more fun to do?   Oh well, it's over now but it was a very traumatic&nbsp;experience!   Mmmm...I still haven't learnt all my lines for this audition. I have to do it next friday. Never mind. I still have about a week but I also have to prepare it (may be taking an onion with me(it's a crying scene!)) someone has&nbsp;offered me there performing sevices to help me prepare but this was Ondrej.   Although I've been on holiday, I don't seem to have much to write. I could talk about the weather but I've done too much of that already. Maybe I should go and learn my lines&nbsp;or read all the zillions of books I have to read before&nbsp;I go back to school. I could go and be sociable with&nbsp;my family but I feel I've done enough of that already.   Oh well, the fun might start tomorrow!&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hello.   Been a good day. Weather has been a bit odd yet again today, Global warming is definatly out of control and nothing can be done about it. (oh dear, I'm going on a ramble. No, not a walking holiday with wellies and a stick but a ramble about the weather. Actually, I'm not so sure which is better?!)   I still have nothing too great to tell. I am going to 'the festival' tomorrow which should be fun, if it doesn't rain. But who really&nbsp;cares if it rains? Festival weather-it's predictable.   My mum has started being secret policewomen of our road. She is keeping very close watch on everyone who happens to go past (especially across the road). I would not be suprised if I happened across a police uniform in the washing machine! She believes that there is a bit of drug dealing going on in the caravan across the road (to be honest there is a pretty good chance that she is right!). However, this is the house of Ondrej, (tennis champion and fishing extrodinaire!-not) and I'm sure if he found out about this there would be many bananas thrown and windows broken!   Anyway,&nbsp;I shouldn't be talking about other peoples buisiness!   La-di-la! My brother road his bike to Nailsea today (crazy boy). God knows why. I'll give you the lowdown. It is raining, it is cold, he didn't have to wait very long for a lift there and he could have spent an hour or so with me and Holly! (mmm...I see his point).   Aaaarrrgghhhh, I am slightly scared about my&nbsp;audition (having never had one before). Why do I put myself through this? It always seems so good at the time!   I have to 'break down into incoherant tears' what in the world does that mean, I don't even&nbsp;know if that's how you spell it! Oh well, I can't change my spontanious decision of wanting an audition!   Well, I'm going to go to bed now, and read my ever so thrilling book.   I'll leave you with a question: 'why are bananas yellow?'   No, I don't know either!
hey people im on jess's website i am really cool. my name is holly and i am so boring i have nothing to say. apart from how great jess's website is :D thankyou and goodbye x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x
Hopelessly trying to return to normality after being with Lynne for many hours!  Wow, I haven't written for ages...I think I have lost my rhythm!i.e not knowing what to write! It has been a long day. I went to the cinema, very much fun. Shreck is very cool although I think they should stay being human at the end as living as an ogre can not be all that good and probably isn't all that happy and they are meant to be living happily ever after. I guess they want the moral of the story to be 'no matter how ugly you are, you still have a chance of finding true love', however it comes across as 'people like you more if you're pretty so if you want to marry an ogre be prepared for people not liking you'?!  What is strange about the film though, is that at the end of Shreck 1 they were all ready to live happily ever after and they went off on their honeymoon with everyone liking them. Yet, when they return home, in Shreck 2 everyone, seems to have forgotten this and they don't like them anymore. Oh well, not all of us can be as intelligent as me! Mmmm...what to write about now? The book I'm reading? It's very...graphic! I'm sure people, like myself, should not be exposed to this kind of...adult behaviour!  It's supposed to be about world war 1 but I haven't read anything about the war so far. I think the English department should read these books before telling us to read them! I am, of course, reading it for English. I would not read books like this because I feel like it although it can be quite amusing! Well, tomorrow is my clarinet lesson, hopefully. It was cancelled last week, without me knowing! So it had better be on tomorrow otherwise I will...not be happy! Anyway, I'm going to watch Eastenders now and then print out some more pictures of Paris for my picture board.  I'll write again, probably. Not sure when though!
This is one of your friends here, wonder if you can guess which one?! i am going to the cinema with you today, and my name is not Jenny.  Well, done it's Lynne!! Hee..Hee.. I'm going to go and do something intelligent now, not sure what yet, maybe solve world hunger or something!!
Raining again! Did you see the hail stones this morning (it was quite early so I'll forgive you if you didn't!)? What is it with the weather, has mother nature gone completely mad? I'm guessing it's all down to that disastrous thing called Global Warming! It has been the coldest July for 50 years! And if you compare it to last years...Well, we must now be living in the Antarctic!  I got my photographs of Paris back from the chemist and they are very good, I think. Everyone I have shown so far has liked them! I have also organised my trip to the cinema, with Lynne and Jenny (see, I can be organised) and we will be seeing Shreck 2. So this is good, however it still leaves me with many weeks of not doing much as this cinema trip will only last a few hours.  Hopefully people will be camping in my garden at the weekend, if the rain holds off otherwise, I've told them, we will be sleeping in the garage (I'm sure my parents will be pleased!)It should be a fun weekend if everyone can make it here maybe I will have to invite extra people incase some people can't come! I will try and make it a bit like Glastonbury, apart from the toilets, and the mud, and the scary people. Ok, so it won't be much like Glastonbury! Never mind! Lalala... I'm not really sure what to write! I would tell you about my amazing next door neighbours but we don't have any at the mo. Or I could tell you about my friends...not much to tell there then (I'm so mean). Ummm, my secret love affairs...no don't have any of them either! Oh well.  I'll have to stop writing for today then. Maybe I could go and invent something like... a nose warmer as my nose is very cold, probably because the window's open! Oh dear, I can be blonde sometimes!
I am very bored (yet again)! I am also confused. Mainly about a trip to the cinema and aboout my clarinet lesson (which I won't go into!) I don't know when I'm going to the cinema or who I'm going with or what I'm going to see. I want to see Shreck but everyone has seen that now but I am still going to go and see it anyway! I, also, now have a million weeks to amuse myself until we go back to school in September. I could get a job but I don't know where. I also have an audition to prepare for but I kinda don't want to as I'm too scared to do it. I tried reading it aloud to myself yesterday and I even scared myself! I have to read a zillion books over the holidays too so that will also waste some time. Hopefully I will have finished at least one by the time I get back from the Isle Of White but you can't be too ambishious can you! But I am not and I repeat NOT going to spend the whole of my holiday reading books but what else can I do? I am finding that many of my friends are getting, or have got jobs, or are going on holiday. I think I'm feeling a bit left out (jealous perhaps?). I dunno. Life is a bit perculiar at the mo.  My family has finally lost the plot. My father is running round the house squealing like a girl and my mother is having a childish tantrum about the chair she wants to sit on; 'I'm there' she complained, (so thats where I get my selfishness from!)  It's not that I want to sound moany and unreasonable, it's all true. I do love my family (most of the time) but sometimes I wish I was out of the house (especially on friday nights) having a laugh. It does happen occasionly but it is very rare! In saying that, I did go out last friday night. I went sailing down the Seine! (hehe, it sounds sooo posh) Well it wasn't really sailing more kind of boating in a large boat with millions of people but suprisingly not too many Japanese tourists (not that I'm complaining about them to much but if I had wanted too meet some Japanese tourists I would have gone to Japan! As I told Lynne, 'that is where most of them like to hang out!') Oh well, I only went out then as I was on holidaybut these little outings are not regular occurances. Maybe I could get a hobby. Stamp collecting? No. Not even I would stoop that low. I could try doing some exercise but it rains too much in this country to even imagine going outside and anyway my parents would think of it as some sort of joke. When I told my mother my shoulder hurt the other day she told me it was because of my lack of exercise and I should try and move a bit further than up to my bed and too the fridge. That's parenting for you! Anyway, I think i have written way too much and I have probably written things that are classed as racist and parentist and I have also complained about my friends! Oh dear. I am now going to go and do something energetic...does turning the television on count? No, seriously...there's not much room to exercise in my bedroom, however I'm sure stepping over all the stuff that's on the floor must count for something!  Well, I'll write soon, with, hopefully no more nasty comments!
What a day. I went to school and learnt that I should probably keep my comments to myself rather than post them on the internet. I should learn to 'hold my tongue' (not literally). I think I like being back at school it's more fun than daytime TV, there is only so much of 'Richard and Judy' a person can handle! I went to the dentist (I'm sure you're extatic for me!) and changed the colour of my brace to blue and blue! Unfortunatly I had to go to school afterwards to go to English Lit. I learnt from someone that there will be eight people in our drama class this year (that's quite a lot) this is good as the people I knew who were going to be in it I don't think I could stand being around for too long so I hope the new people are nice! Don't want to write much more as I want to do something else (don't know exactly what yet, but I sure it will be fun!) I'll write soon!
Feeling lonely and needed to write something. I have no one around to talk to now after last week and it's really weird. Actually feeling happy about going to school tomoz as I will see my friends again! I am watching the football at the mo, is anyone else? Maybe I should learn something intelligent to do (too much like hard work tho) I could read a book I suppose! (bit of advice: never read whilst eating, unless you want a mouthful of...Harry Potter? a lot of people read that dont they?) I may visit some people next week, when I have nothing to do (which is quite likely) and I'll have to go out somewhere if I have enough money. This is called planning ahead (I'll never go through with any of it but it makes me feel better). My life isn't lways this dull if that's what you think, I can be interessting, if I try, (wearing a box on your head is interessing, isn't it)!
Hello!   The fiesta was fun. Me and Lynne saw many bands and people.   We saw Rachel Stevens, Big Brovaz, Girls Aloud, Sugababes and many others! Oh, and Peter Andre (very exciting.)   There were thousands of people (really, there were) and when we were stood very near to the front and looked back there was just a sea of people for millions of miles!   Me and mum have pickled more beetroot this morning and there's still more to go. We could feed all the people at Ashton Court for the whole weekend!   My fingers are all purple now.    My dad's just got back from ASDA and no, he doesn't live there! He was doing 'the weekly shopping', it has taken him about two hours though but there you are.   My parents have decided to go to Yorkshire or somewhere next week. I don't think they realise that if we're getting rain here then it must be pretty bad up there. They want to go walking, up a hill. Don't ask why. They are a bit odd. My mum said 'oh you should come Jess, we won't be walking far'   'How far?'   'Only 5ish miles'   Up a hill, she must be joking. Hills in that part of the world are more like mountains.    Talking off mountains, the Olympics start this weekend (I think). You have to be very olympic to be able to walk up those hills.   Oh, exciting news...I've finished my book!!! It's only taken me about a month. It was sooo boring (as I've said before) and I've got to read another one that looks even more boring! Great.   Anyway...I'll leave you with...a question. Ummm why is the world round?         So we don't walk off the end.
Hey, I'm back.   It did rain but it's sunny again now.    Mum just rang to say that they are on their way back now! They said it's raining where they are and they are stuck in a traffic jam! (well, we can't all be lucky)   So yeh, my audition was alright, until I forgot this one line and it threw me completly. But never mind, I can always try again next year!    I went horse riding on monday with Jenny and Anna and it rained, alot! We got absolutly soaked and now I think Jenny has pneumonia!   I went shopping with mum yesterday and she bought me many things! I got some new converse shoes that are pink and I put pink laces in them. I don't think I will wear them tonight as the grass at Ashton Court will be very wet!   It's been a week since I last wrote properly (that's a long time) so mum will be going to yoga again tonight!   I think there are lots of things happening this weekend, if only I could remember them. Oh well, I have learnt to go with the flow and sort of just wait for things to happen and hope that they do happen (which they usually do) and hope that they are nice things!   I feel incredibly calm just waiting for things. You would think that I would be worried that nothing is going to happen but there you are! Maybe it's something to do with Norah Jones, (that's what I'm listening to at the mo) her music is soooo calming and relaxing!   There are many campervans and caravans going down our road at the mo, to the farmers field because of the festival.   It's like caravan city. The welsh caravans have all put HUGE welsh flags up. My mum drove past them yesterday and said 'do they want to be burnt down?'. You can tell she doesn't really like the welsh but it is true. Some people round here don't like the welsh so it's not a good idea to advertise that you are welsh by putting flags up around your caravan.  It does however, show that there is a little colonie of welsh people in one corner of the field (tres amusing)!   Oh dear, they can't help being welsh. Ummm...is that racist (I hope not!).   Anyway, enough of that.   Maybe I should stop writing now, this has turned into a small essay. Maybe I should become a writer, (any comments on this subject will be taken into consideration, just don't be rude about this statement) it make actually turn out as a more likely career than an actress or a farmer!   Anyway, I really am going now.   I may write again tomorrow if I can get my hands on this computer instead of my own.   Any words of wisdom...ummm... always take the right path,... not the wrong one!
Hello! Long time no write! My computer won't let me write on it anymore, it's sooo odd. Anyhow. I have loads to tell !  My brother rang from Devon last night at about 2am saying he wanted some one to go and take him home. At that hour? I don't think so! I did my audition and I think it went ok. I am hopeful but I'm not counting on anything-if you see what I mean. Ummm...the balloon fiesta is today so I'm going up there with Lynne (should be fun, if it doesn't rain), it looks as though it's about to rain now so... Oh, you know I talked about my farmers genes, well my mother has really got into pickling beetroot at the moment. We have already made about 16 or so jars of the stuff and thats only about a fifth or so of what we've actually grown in the allotment! The other day we got a little bit of a production line going-one person cooked, one person peeled and the other person squished it into a jar. Everyone turned purple during this process (heehee). I've practically finished the book. I have about ten pages left so I will finish it today! My parents are now accepting the fact that we will go to America next year. My mum even got an American brouchure from the travel agents. It looks so cool. I have decided we should have a day in Las Vegas (I'm a gambler at heart). I think there's a thunder storm a brewing! It's gone incredibly dark! Anyway I'll have to write again later as Beki's coming to put something on my computer. This is not goodbye...
Hello!   I have an audition tomorrow!   I'm quite scared (as I have said many times) but I am also excited-which can only be a good thing!   This time tomorrow and it will be all over.   Guess what. I have been on my bike every day since Friday (how energetic), I even think I am growing muscles! (now that's a new experience!)   Mmmm...I don't have a lot to say, but then I never do!   Although I have been doing all this exercise I wanted to eat an ice cream today. Usually this ice cream van comes down our road at about 5 but today I could hear but it didn't go past! How rude!   My mum and dad are out at the moment (coinsidently, doing exercise). My mother is doing yoga. She is really getting into it actually. Maybe a bit too much. She keeps going on about your inner this and your inner that and how to balance your chakras etc. She also makes a great deal of fuss over her yoga mat. I mean, it's only a mat!   My father is 'training' (not sure what for), he goes to the gym and lifts a couple of weights (can't be training for a marathon then). They will be home soon.   Anyway, I'm bored now.    I'm going to go and read over my lines a couple more times-I think I know them now (I hope I know them now).    Well, that's all for today.   I'll leave you with some words of wisdom:   If the string breaks, try another piece of string.
I went shopping today. And I bought some stuff!    Oh, I was going to tell you last time about 'the new neighbours'. They moved in next door (suprisingly). They have a little boy called Jake (who is very sweet) and a dog. They have turned into my personal alarm clock. They always seem to be outside with a barking dog and a screaming child at about 9 o clock!    Anyway, I've almost learnt my lines for friday. God, that seems soooo close now. I don't think I'm scared (yet) maybe a little nervous and full of anticipation! It's quite weird, I'm quite weird. I still don't know why I want to do this. I put myself through all this and I might not even get anything out of it except the experience of being terrified!   I've also still got all those books to read before school starts again. I think I'll get down to that after Friday.   Ummm...I found out something today. Someone I know, who I've known since I was little, well, her parents are splitting up-or have split up. It's really odd. I've always thought they were very different people but I never thought this would happen. They're going to have to sell the house and everything. This is sooo weird. You don't expect this type of thing to happen. I mean, whats going to happen to them all.   Okay, so it's not the end of the world, but I'm sure it feels that way for the kids.   Anyway, it's something to think about. How would I feel if that happened to my parents?    Mmmm...life is perculiar.   I feel as though I should do something but I know that's stupid. I have a headache. Too much stuff is going on at the mo.     I can't even attempt at at a funny comment.   Sorry...
Happy, happy, happy! I don't know why. The sun is out the sky is blue I'm going brown oh, whoop-di-do! Where do my talents end! Maybe I should take up a job in poetry land. Mr Shakespeare, Mr Blake, Roald Dahl, stand aside, poetry genius coming through! Well, maybe I still need a bit of practice. It is all true, though. About the sun and that. Mmmm...any stories to tell? I know, I believe I have farmers genes (that's genes as in chromosome type things not, as my mother thought, farmers jeans, when I told her) I went to the allotment yesterday and picked peas and beans and ate a few strawberries too. I was stung by a nettle and scratched by planks of wood (very rural stuff). When we got home me and mum popped the pea and bean pods. I believe I have pea popping genes (now that would be funny if they were pea popping jeans!). Anyway, I only have one other story, I think. Yesterday night, around 11pm, I was watching TV in the living room and happened to look out the window (that wasn't the story, just the build up) the security light came on outside the Toman's house and this person was walking around looking around the bins, at the door and then started waving this big stick in the air. At first I had a funny feeling that it could have been a burglar but then I thought only a very stupid burglar would wave a huge stick around in the air. Mum opened the window and shouted out to it. Then a large afro appeared, closely followed by James. He had got home without a key and no-one was in so he thought he would amuse himself with a large stick. Oh well, not everyone can be a genius. I might go shopping tomorrow unless it's hot, then I won't go shopping tomorrow. I'll write soon. I won't leave you with another 'mind bending' question as I seem to have run out of them...For now!
What's really important? What's it all about, this Hellenism thing?  Hellenic Wiccans Hellenic Reconstructionists Hellenic Traditionalists: a term in flux, characterized by detractors in various ways (which we should really put to bed).  HT can also be used in contrast with HR in the sense of reconstructionism being an activity.  Hellenion: an organization of which I am a member and in which I am taking on more responsibility. Hellenion is suffering from some identity issues which should be resolved in order for the organization to move forward in a well-founded way.  Has been called 'too liberal', 'too conservative', and 'trying to be all things to all people'. The last accusation should be better stated:  1. Define the term. 2. How does it apply to Hellenion? 3. Even if it's true and applies to us, is it really all that bad?  OSNT has been called too inaccurate to recommend to newbies. Perhaps a good way to put this to bed is to recruit the detractors, asking them to detail the complaints they have with the book.  Hellenic Wicca: By all reputable accounts, a 20th-century innovation. It seems based on WMT, masonry, etc. There's fair enough reason to see Wicca as an off-shoot of WMT with a polytheistic wrapper of sorts. Most Wicca do not appear to be 'hard polytheists', but influenced by Jung, Joseph Campbell, etc. and see deity as archetype. Some of the particulars of Wiccan symbolism may stem from ancient Hellenic mystics, though. Wiccans who attempt to incorporate Hellenic deities as archetypes aren't going to be very popular with Recons, but we can benefit some of the more polytheistic Wiccans by providing research that can inform them.  Eclectics vs. dedicants of specific traditions: Eclectics may choose bits and pieces from traditions that seem to fit well together in their eyes. When eclectics are contrasted with recons, the recon will tend to lean toward a more holistic approach to a given cultural framework. Eclectics may be more likely to change fairly radically in view and practice over time, whereas recons will endeavor to become progressively more consistent in dealing with the specified cultural framework as more is learned and new research sheds new light on the subject matter.  Hellenic recons have a lot more to work with than some other recons who reconstruct cultures in which there was less literacy or from which less material survives today for various reasons.  We have to make decisions about whether we're going to reconstruct within our own cultural framework (animal sacrifice, women's rights, and pederasty being hot button points). Assuming we're going to do this, we have to deal with other issues, such as researching the ancient culture really well to transcend what Wittgenstein might call a 'language game' separating ourselves from the ancient culture we're reconstructing.  Language Games: Even under the best of circumstances (face-to-face conversation between people sharing common language and culture), language games limit communication. The greater the divide between individuals (due to language, culture, etc.), the more severe the limitations placed upon communication, and the more challenging the reconstruction process. For instance, there are serious differences between an English-speaking 21st-century North American and an Attic-speaking Athenian from the era of Socrates, which present situations with which we simply need to come to terms. Most HR's I have encountered so far seem to have a basic respect for this.  Adopting antagonistic stances further complicates the process of communicating and reconstructing effectively.  Once one states a position, one becomes open to criticism and 'Socratic' questioning. It might be tempting to turn the tables on the accusers, but this is generally not a good idea. Readers and viewers of this sort of thing can generally see the pettiness and egocentrism of it. A better solution is to extend xenia and hospitality to our detractors as much as possible, not as a strategy but to reinforce community. We're an amazingly small minority and should come together as opposed to further driving one another away. Differences need not imply divisiveness. A communitarian and inclusive approach, founded on mutual respect and humility before the gods is the way to go.  We need to beef up our programs such as Hymnodia and publish lots of practical material for people to use in their own study and practice. If our publications are criticized, we should accept the criticism. If the criticism is spurious, accept it as so and move on, but if there's something in it we can use to improve our work, let's be grateful for it and use it to enhance the integrity of our efforts.  More on culture: We have to be honest with ourselves about some of the realities we're dealing with. It is astonishingly difficult to reproduce an ancient culture with great precision, which does not imply that the effort lacks merit.  Some people rely more or less heavily on UPG, which is perfectly fine but presents challenges when it comes to persuading others of one's findings. If you don't present your findings as founded on good research, you need to rely on something else in argumentation, such as results of some kind.  Not everyone is going to go for your approach, no matter which approach you employ. Even if every single Recon on the planet does agree with you, we're a startlingly small fraction of the world's population. So ultimately I think it's really important to invest your energies and efforts in something important to you and in which you find satisfaction.
Recons have a fascinating tendency to focus on minutia (which is one of those words that doesn't look right when you see how you've spelled it, but passes the dictionary.com test). This can be both great and positively miserable (maybe simultaneously, but misery has a way of making it hard to see greatness).  Some of what's great about it is that we can sometimes make really neat discoveries in the process of picking little crap apart, which can then be passed on to those who have lives.  Some of what's miserable about it is that one can fail to 'see the forest for the trees' as the old saying goes.  For instance, I recently read a great deal of discussion about libation, which is a well-loved topic for me. (See the meaning of the term  sponde  for more on why.) In the discussion, I saw the libation process picked apart, but much more emphasis seemed to be placed on how a certain author had  really screwed up  by describing the libation process in a manner that didn't set well with some of the people involved in the discussion.  One simple fact of the matter is that libations (like many other facets of ancient Hellenic religious practice) were actually quite varied in detail depending on who was libating under what circumstances. To cite Burkert's  Greek Religion  (which may be over-hyped, but is still a darn good book), p. 71:   When Achilles sends Patroclus out to battle, he takes from his chest the cup from which he alone drinks, cleans it, washes his hands, and draws the wine; then, stepping into the court, he pours out the wine and, looking up to the sky, prays for the victory and safe return of his friend.      Libation could be quite simple. Period.       Elaborate rites were carried out, as were simple, spontaneous acts of devotion, prayer, desperation, etc.  But (and seriously check this out), even the ancient Hellenes practiced Reconstructionism! I kid you not, and cite Burkert again (p. 107):    The meal in the sanctuary may be marked as extraordinary when, in contrast to normal civilization, the ancient way of life is imitated: a bed of twigs,  stibas , takes the place of seats or banqueting couches, and the house is replaced by an improvisational hut,  skene  -- misleadingly translated as tent. The twigs on which one sits assume a symbolic character which varies according to deity and festival: pine or willow for the Thesmophoria, and wild olive branches in Olympia.    So.....  Should we have Recon banquets in which we reconstruct the ancient Hellenic practice of reconstructing even more ancient practices?  And did any ancients ever come down hard on other ancients who used the wrong twigs for a given festival?
I'm a bit concerned about some of the divisions I see within Hellenic polytheism these days.  It's not the divisions themselves which concern me, because variation is good. We shouldn't be overspecialized, but should represent the diversity present within the community.  Hellenic polytheism includes, but isn't limited to Hellenion and other 'Hellenic Reconstructionist' groups and individuals, Hellenic wiccans, people devoted to Hellenic deities but not all that concerned with reconstructionism, a 'group' (for lack of a better word) called 'Hellenic Traditionalists' and more.  What  does  concern me is what seems like divisive behavior driving potential wedges between us all in ways that aren't necessarily healthy or helpful. I'm talking about antagonistic behavior, of which any of us can be guilty from time to time, but which I've been witnessing more than I feel comfortable with here lately.  Drew Campbell's book is not beyond criticism, but it's also far from worthless. I've seen Hellenion called too liberal, too conservative, and that it tries to be all things to all people, and the simple fact is that these can not all be objectively true at the same time. People make statements reflecting their subjective impressions, and those statements are objectified (sometimes by the speaker, and sometimes by offended readers/listeners).  Can't we all try to get along?  Since the  very first day  that sponde.com came into being, I've tried to get people from various camps to contribute articles, hymns, and pretty much  anything  else. But so far, almost every word of content on the site has come from members of Hellenion, the organization that everyone seems to love to hate. Does this mean that only Hellenion members are publishing things of value? I'd hesitate to go that far, but I would much rather be able to offer a definite  NO .  I'm not sure I have one simple solution to this problem, but I do think that we'd be better off if we poured more of this energy into actual Hellenic polytheism. Isn't that something we can agree on enough to put all this other stuff to bed?
So, I'm replying to Kyrene.  Don't want to keep doing this anonymously.....  Says here you can have an account in just 3 minutes! Woot!  So, now it appears I've got another blog.  Thanks, Kyrene.....  I blame YOU!  ;)

Welcome to my Blog!!!
Football Fan's!! I went out to dinner with my family tonight. My cousins were in town so me, my mom & dad, my grandmother, & my aunt & uncle went out for Chinese at a great buffet place, & came home went to NFL.com to find out the Tampa Bay BUCS are the NFC Champions. Congrats to the BUCS!!!! I then turned on the Titians Vs. Raiders game to see the Titians were holding there own only down buy 3 point in the 3rd quarter, but the Raiders were the stronger team and prevailed, and the Oakland Raiders are the AFC Champions. Congrats to the Raiders!!!!  Super bowl XXXVII will be a good one!!!!!
I took the  urlLink Dirty Mind test  !!!  my score was 80    This probably isn't much of a shocker, but you've got a one-track mind! Either your hormones have taken over your brain or you're feeling deprived in some way, because s-e-x is the first thing that pops into your mind on almost any occasion. This may or may not be a problem, depending on the point to which your fantasizing takes over your mental processes - thinking about getting it on is a vital part of any healthy sex drive, but it can bring trouble when it's too extreme. As long as you are still able to shut off that part of your brain when need be (while working, for example), there's no cause for concern.
How ya'll doing tonight i was at our local county fair tonight Volunteering selling refreshment in the expo building and got to see john anderson, what a great show. just thought i would share my cool experiance.
Funny thing happened today. i live in Florida, South Florida actually, and in the 19 years i have lived in this state the news has never reported snow. thats right SNOW, yesterday(1/24/2003) in Sebastian, Fla there were snow flurries. i wasn't' at all surprised since the tempatures were in the low 30's to low 50's.    on a lighter note i got Linux on my laptop FINALLY!!!
Football Fans!!!!  Super Bowl XXXVII was a great game.   Tampa Bay Bucs - 48 Oakland Raiders - 21  Dexter Jackson as Super Bowl MVP was a good choice.
Febuary 1, 2003   Crew of the space shuttle Columbia....REST IN PEACE heros!!!!
Football Fans!!!!  -  Well the 2002 NFL season is officially over, and was caped off with a blowout victory buy the AFC in the Pro Bowl.  Final Score: AFC - 45 NFC - 20  Miami Dolphin Ricky Williams was the MVP of the game which made me happy since i am a devoted Fins fan.  Jason Taylor, Zach Thomas, and Sam Madison also had a great game.   Augest isn't close enought.  the highlight of the game other then Ricky being MVP was Colts QB Payton Manning Calling his kicker an Idiot for comments he made about Payton. funny stuff.
RANT!!!!   -  All this talk about not going back into space is ridiculous. It is a tragic thing that happened on Saturday, but the Astronauts that risked there lives to explore space wouldnt want us to abandon the program because they lost there lives.  Exploring space is like exploring the depths of the ocean. Many have died exploring the ocean, but that doesnt mean we still dont have submarines.   If you ask me the lose of 14 astronauts, and 2 shuttles in a 22 year period isnt that bad of a number, yes its sad 7 astronauts lost there life in 1986 when challenger exploded on lift off, and its just as sad that 7 astronauts lost there life in Columbia on reentry, but those are the risks and the brave men and women that have that opportunity knew that before lift off and during reentry.  my thought are with the families that lost loved ones on Febuary 1, 2003
Thanks goes to  urlLink Chris Pirillo  for the  urlLink STS-107 Tribute  link.

urlLink Nascar  -  I can't help but notice that  urlLink Dale Jr. (#8)  is starting his season like  urlLink Tony Stewart  did last year, bad showing at Daytona and had good season, and  urlLink Tony Stewart  won the WC Champ.     urlLink  GO DALE!!!!
As I watch the Liberation of Iraq, I can only hope the men & women of the US Armed Services stay safe and come home safely.
Computers - Tonight I decided to install Redhat 8 on my Pentium 4, well it's   2:42 A.M & running great.   I just hope i can get the programs i want to use to install.
Rant!!!   -   Ever have one of those set backs in your life, where no matter what happened the outlook looked grim, what i am talking about is being unemployed. I mean no matter how many resumes i send out for a job that i know i can do, the response is, ' sorry we're looking for someone w/ a little more experience ', or ' we decide to go with someone else '. I have 3+ years experience building & repairing computers, and setting up networks, and can tackle most problems and resolve them. I am not looking to become the admin of a server datacentre (at least not tomorrow). I just want the opportunity that i deserve, and to top it off   UNEMPLOYMENT SUCKS!!!!!
urlLink      Saturday I went a bought the new Linkin Park CD  urlLink Meteora , the cd is awsome, and while i was at  urlLink Winamp.com  i found a pretty cool skin from  urlLink Linkin Park  for winamp3.
urlLink Nascar  -   urlLink Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Wins the Aaron's 499 @ Talladega superspeedway, that win bumped  urlLink Dale Jr.  into second in the Winston Cup point standings.
Computers -   Tonight I had to reinstall windows on my laptop, the reason I had to reinstall windows was because Partition Magic 8, wouldn't allow me to resize my current partition.  It's a 30GB HD and I wanted to dual boot windows with mandrake 9.1.   The way I partitioned the drive:  Total size 27.94GB (30GB) 9.75GB - Windows XP Pro 9.75GB - Storage 8.40GB - Mandrake 9.1  I finally decided to just wipe the 1 week old install from when i had to wipe the drive to recover some bad sectors.  I had two drives that had that issue in the last two weeks.  The first one was one of my WD 100GB drives, but i wasn't two surprised since the drive had the original format from when i bought it, and i had written & deleted files on it since the drive was bought.  The Second was the 30GB Laptop drive, and I glad to say both are working.
Computers   -  Last week i was about one BOSD away from throwing my PC across the room & going into debt, and buying a G4.   Thank god for Red Hat 8 & the Winblows XP(eXtra Pain) repair utility which helped me get all my important files(MP3's) off my HD just incase i was going to reformat the HD, &  then the kicker after i did all that, Xplay decided to clear out the  itunes.db  file on my ipod, & i was forced to restore the ipod to factory settings and resync the songs.   I wish steve jobs would come to the realization that porting OS X to the Intel & AMD Platform would be a good thing.
My Uncle is the best he got my cousin & me tickets to the last show on the  urlLink OZZFEST 2003  tour on Aug. 28 in West Palm Beach @ Coral Sky Amphitheatre.  I am so stoked, i get to see Ozzy, my favorite band Disturbed will be there along with KoRn, Marilyn Manson, & Chevelle, plus many other good bands.  I can't wait till the summer.
Computers   -  I finailly went WiFi for my laptop, i decided to go with the    urlLink SMC2404WBR   11/22Mbps router w/ 3 port switch which i am using as a Wireless access point, and for my laptop i got the  urlLink SMC2435W  11/22Mbps PCMCIA WiFi Card.   It's great I was impressed with the fact I could watch a divx movie on my laptop from my desktop.
It was my lucky day -   Today I was curising along up US-1 on my way to a client and I wasn't paying attention to the the Speed-o-meter, and a cop stepped out in front of my truck and motioned to me to pull over, so i did, and he then asked me if i knew the speed limt and i responded to him buy saying is it 50 or 45, he said it's 45 and i clocked you at 55 he said 'Slow it down' and he let me on my way with a warning.    I lucked out. if it was the interstate or near my town, i would have gotton a nice fat ticket.
Today is MY 25th Birthday.........

Stupid Copy Protection!!!!!  ok i bought a new CD yesterday Nickelback's The Long Road, and of course i brought it home popped it in the CD drive and ripped it to mp3 to put on my ipod, then i decided before I went to sleep to burn a copy to keep in the car, and put the original back in the sleeve and went to bed. This morning i got in my truck placed the cd in the head unit and all the tracks were popping and hissing. Now here is the part that pissed me off all the mp3's I ripped sound great no popping or hissing. unless it's my burner I think the copy protection is a little backwards, I can rip files to my HD but I can't make a copy of the disc to preserve the life of the intellectual property I paid my hard earned money for.  The reason I think it is copy protection is I copied the new Fuel CD Natural Selection, and it sounds like the original.  Right now I am trying to copy the disc w/ xcdrost in Redhat 9.
WiFi card for Linux on laptop....   I finally found a wifi card that works with my laptop, the  urlLink   Netgear MA401   , I had one where i work that we use to get laptops on the internet to do updates and stuff when they don't have a NIC card, a USB port(for a usb nic), an O/B ethernet port, or when we don't have an open cat5 cable to plug the laptop to. So I tried it, & what da you know it worked. So i went to compusa after work and spent more money....being a geek is so expensive.   I am just happy I can use linux on my lappy w/ my wireless network.
My new iPod!!!!!  I have pondered over it long enough, and since they released itunes for windows, I decided to get the new docking ipod.   unopened    Just out of the box     In it's dock    In the dock next to the 2nd Gen    I will admit i wasn't a big fan of the 3g ipod till i went to the apple store to look around(guys windows shopping), and actually held it, and i then pondered over it and walked in to the apple store Saturday and bought one. Now i just need a case.
Hell has froze over!!!!    The reason i say this is i did something i thought i would never do, and i bought a DELL. Granted it's a Laptop, but it's still a DELL.  Now i think i got an awsome deal on it, i paid $1000 for a:     Inspiron 5100 2.4Ghz P4 Intel 845G Mobo 256 PC2100 DDR ATI Readon 7500 16MB(on the small side but it's enought) 40GB HD CDRW 15' LCD Windows XP Home(which quickly became Professional)  I have only had it for 3 days now, and it's seem to be solid, hasn't crashed yet The Main reason i bought it was the 1394, & the CDRW.  One thing i saw which i haven't been able to confirm is, i saw it had USB 2.0 which would be awsome since i just bought a new docking ipod and the USB 2.0/Firewire cable for it.  It's biggest test will be in 3 weeks when i travel to VA to vist my brother, i will be on airplanes for a while, so i will need something to do, and from the looks of the spec on this lappy it will beable to handle some of my fav games.  I will let everyone know how this new purchase turns out.

I went to talk to the new owner of the repair shop I used to work at today, and he offered me my job back, the reason I left originally is a long story, and not worth going into, but after being out of work for 3 months I am happy that I am going back to work.

the doctor told me to get some ice and sit with foot up. i knew peter (my mgr.) wasn't going to take this well. i got a note from the doctor (for peter) and an appointment to return in 2 weeks to check my progress. i wasn't supposed to work for that 2 weeks. i was living paycheck to paycheck at this point. our store was floundering so i wasn't getting enough hours to live on as it was! good thing about working for a corporation is the benefits. i applied for short term disability (S.T.D.) right away since it takes some time and  tons  of paperwork. i was still waiting to hear on that when it was time to go back to the doctor.    if i had a penny for every time someone asked me '  how  did you do this again?' i would have more pennies than i could easily carry around. i wish i had a much better story of how this happened. i even tried to pass one off . the problem with it was anyone who knew me would start laughing after my opening sentence. here, let me show you. 'so i was in this one night stand...' i told you before i'm a terrible liar.   when i went back to the doctor he couldn't belief my lack of progress. he asked 'the question' at least twice and sent me away with a slip to get another x-ray and a referral to an orthopedic surgeon. he also gave me another note for peter extending my time off for another month. he wanted to get me into P.T. but felt we needed to do more healing first.   before i was to see the othro doc he referred me to radiology for an M.R.I.. the purpose of a M.R.I is to look for signs of muscular and bone damage a regular x-ray wouldn't show. i know you are all wondering so i will just say yes. each person i saw in the progression of healthcare providers asked 'the question' in near disbelief. the more time that passed it took on a comical quality.   by the time i saw othro doc it had been about a month since that fateful day. he wanted to get me back on both legs and back to work so he had me fitted for a walking cast. he gave the okay for P.T and wanted to see me in a month. things were getting back to normal or so i thought. work rejected my walking cast for safety and health code reasons. CRAP!! i couldn't return to work until i could do so without my cast.   thankfully around this time my S.T.D. kicked in and i could pay rent. lots of phone time and paperwork involved but i'm thankful i had this. it didn't pay the amount i was used to but it was something!   my life as i was used to it changed drastically from that day forward. being the independent gal i am suddenly needing to rely on others for simple things was hard. some can give testimonials that i would borderline on difficult at times. hard to believe i know. :) since then i have had to change the way i do things and give up some things i really enjoy. it's okay 'cause i'm still standing- just differently.
as i already said i had a  blast  monday night! one of the reasons was the fact that people seemed to put their personal conflicts aside and came together for the evening. i know when you have a small diverse group not everybody is going to get along all of the time. especially when there is a lot of overlap in their time together. so thank you all for a great evening. i for one needed a night of merriment with people i enjoy and am i comfortable with.    i know i didn't do the promised song but i had my peter brady on! i can safely say that was allergy induced. not sure at this point what could be new or stronger to add to the allergies other than the layer of smog we are getting. one day soon i shall grab that mic and shock you all! in the meantime i keep dodging singing games in shows but would do it if was called for. good or bad sing loudly and proudly. :)   i know i promised details of the evening but in remembering a great evening to those who weren't there can sometimes make it sound sorted. for those who were there nothing that happened was new or different for that gathering. so i shall just leave it at that   i look forward to one day doing karaoke in the bay area with mike and marissa. hopefully one or both will come back to visit and sing. i'm hoping sam will do the same too! you are all missed.
i try to keep a 'the glass is half full' perspective on my life. i have some heavy decisions to make and deal with right now. the reason i'm writing this is to let you know that if i don't seem my usual positive adorable self not to worry. what you can do is send positive energy my way. for some reason 'we' have to be tested regularly by the entity in charge of the universe. to really see what we are made of and how much we can handle without being broken. well, i'm still standing and plan to stay that way! so be honest but kind to me and i will soon have my stuff worked out.    i will have my boys for two weeks starting thursday so be patient if my posts are wacky, few, and almost gibberish. we  are  going to come up with a system of sharing the computer without it turning into a dictatorship. (i hope) kisses to all!
on march 29th 2004 at 10  : 45 in the morning i was walking home from work. it was a beautiful spring day and i was looking forward to a walk through a big park near by for exercise . i was also taking my camera along in hopes of some cherry blossom shots. work had been uncomfortable but that day i rocked and was in a great mood. i was going over what i needed to gather to get going. there were a couple of cars waiting at the stop sign so i decided to walk a bit closer to my building before i crossed the street. i was almost across from the front door so i went to cross between two cars. they were parked close together so when i stepped down off the curb i stepped on the edge of a hole i didn't see. i  so  didn't expect that. i went down fast and hard. as it was happening i knew i had really messed up. the bag containing my cd player, some cd's, my journal and the small ceramic coffee cup i had just won as a prize went flying (and breaking) all over the street. It's a busy street so i tried in my pain amidst a string of profanity to retrieve my items. one attempt to move and i realized one of my worst fears had come true. the sole bread winner was down!   i have worked hard the last 3 years to be self sufficient. i have not gone out partying on the night before a early morning (early is 3:20am) at work. common sense i know but a lot of my co-workers do it regulary. i would resist buying that awesome pair of shoes that i would love to have but didn't need. i always made sure i had rent and bills covered before all else. Don't give me the sainthood quite yet. what i'm saying is there was nobody around to be my back up. (that's a whole set of stories i will eventually get to) i'm proud of the person i am and evolving into. i have always been and still am a responsible person. yea for me because i had paid the extra for health insurance. in the 1 1/2 years i worked there i never really needed it. some co-workers even had said i should cancel it so i would have extra spending money. i just felt better knowing if i needed it i had it. well i was gonna need it now!   the fire marshal was coming to do an inspection of the sprinkler system in my building. he was freaked out watching me go down and putting sailors everywhere to shame with my string of profanity at a increased volume . he gathered my items and helped me hop to my building. once inside i took it from there and got to my apt. my right knee was bleeding pretty good and i had to get my shoe and sock off while i still could. i was in a lot of pain so i allowed myself a few minutes of crying then i called work to ask if the next person to get off would take me...... wait... where  do  i go? i had no clue since i never had an emergency! i had to play corporate phone transfer til one lady told me my options. that burned up most of the hour i spent waiting for jasmine to show up.    she was new at my store and to portland so i didn't really know her very well. she used the spare keys i kept in my locker to get in my place. she got me advil and cleaned my knee up. she even helped me change out of my uniform! she and her husband drove me cross town to my doctors office. i told them they didn't have to wait for me. i was being fit in so who knew how long i would be. sara, my friend who lived next door, worked over that way and would be getting off about the time i'd probably be done.   the doctor asked me more than once ' how did you do this again?' after an exam and x-ray it was determined that i had severely sprained my ankle and had to stay off it for sometime. ouch.
i'm so glad i made the trip for karaoke because  i had a blast last night! the evening was filled with great music, awesome performances,  cock blocking, fruit flavored drinks, lots of laughter and good old fashion make out sessions. you really can't ask for more than that in one evening! i will get to a more detailed post later but i have to wrestle with the boys for the computer so it may be late tonight or tomorrow. stay tuned to marta's world if you dare. it's not for the faint of heart. :)
so the same friends i do improv with are also serious karaoke folks. they have play lists and go crazy at a new karaoke venue drooling on the song book. i don't want to call them karaoke snobs but they only do songs they know they can do well and  never  done in humor. i've always thought of karaoke as silly fun. Don't get me wrong, they have lots of fun and support each other but it can cause some performance anxiety to a newbie. i think i have an okay voice. i took choir in high school and sounded good with the other second sopranos.    never in the many months of hanging with these folks have i done a song. at first it was because i was catching up with people. i should mention that this happens in eugene not portland. i wasn't avoiding doing it but it just never happened. i think i did turn in a song once late in the evening but it was too late. then near the end of the walking cast phase of my recovery (yes, another story i will get to!) i had tonsillitis for almost 2 months! they actually threatened to remove them if i didn't get better! grrrr! i couldn't sing for awhile then i could do lower notes but not much else. it wasn't funny like the brady bunch episode when the kids formed a music group. they did it to win money to buy their parents an anniversary present. peters voice started to change a couple days before the contest so greg re-wrote his hit song to accommodate peters crackly voice.   i just sounded bad!    it's been 3 months and i have more of a range but still not great. honestly i think it's allergies more that a need to snip! if we transition into fall/winter and it's still a problem then i'll know. i don't have the lovely health insurance now so...i'll cross that bridge when i have to.   two of the gang moved to california late july. one of them has come back for a week to visit mommy and friends. i hope to make the trip so i can see her at monday night karaoke. she is entertaining and enthuiastic - fun to watch. they are both missed but she can shake it while cranking out a tune. not sure i can do this just now but i'm a crazy spontaneous gal. i might finally do a song such as it will sound. :)
i figure i should explain the title to this blog. like most things it's longer than one entry so bear with me. my writing style makes some people cringe but keep reading it might grow on you. if not no worries.   three years ago i had to make a hard decision that hurt people i loved. i had to start my life on my own for the first time. my support system (my family) that i thought would always be there withdrew. actually they believed my (then- now ex) husband. this was bizarre since i always tell the truth. i don't have it in me to lie and you can tell from my face if i am trying. i learned that as a small child. i was truly alone and confused. the person who had been a great friend stepped in and was my support. (this is the bigger painful lesson i learned) i felt that i was truly in the fight for my life. 'they' kept pushing and punching trying to knock me down and out. things got tough but no matter what (you got it) i was still standing. i went down on one knee more than once but something in me just kept me going. (BTW i used to box thus the fighting metaphors) Don't get out any kleenex because this isn't a sad story. i have had some tough times sure and i have learned some valuable things along the way. the most important things i learned is i'm a strong woman. more than that i learned to trust and believe in myself and like  me   . like any journey you make wrong turns and errors in judgment. i certainly made my share of mistakes and suffered from them but that is why i found the strength to be the awesome, hot, strong, funny and easy going gal i am today!    there is (as always) more to the story. in the coming posts it will all be revealed. after all, i'm an open book.
after waiting what seemed years but was really only 16 hours i finally get another turn! i love my boys dearly but they are computer nazi's! they don't get that from me. :) to be fair they aren't allowed to use the computer at their house but  come on!!  i'm done ranting for now.   there is so much that wants to come rushing out i don't know where to start! how about a glimpse into how i really do enjoy the simple things? let me start by giving you a bit of back round. i live in a urban apartment . i really enjoy where i am and it was a block from work . the building i live in is a funky old place with big windows, pocket doors and claw foot tubs. the downfall to this place is the apt. sizes available. most are single and double studios with one 1br and a couple 2 br. thrown in for fun. i was lucky enough to get one of the double studios on the corner so i have cross ventilation. mine is also one of the few that haven't been butchered to make it modern. it has been hellishly hot for a week or so making my world uncomfortable. (i dislike being too hot or cold) this morning i woke up to slightly over cast skies. it is cooler and strangely quiet for a saturday. after i started the coffee i moved the areo bed and got out my outdoor folding chair. (my oldest son was still asleep on the only place besides the bed to sit) as i sat down i had a happy feeling. something about the day and the chair reminded me of camping. i got a goofy smile on my face and basked in the good feeling.
well, i'm not usually one to follow the sheep but in this case i did! it started out innocently enough by getting the site addresses of friends. i would look at their blogs and journals when i remembered to but i soon found myself logging on  just  to view their sites. in fact it got to be a self made frustration! logging on to view the latest and they didn't even have the courtesy to update! then wanting to post comments so i got a user name and  started  but didn't finish setting up a blog of my own. i wondered if people would really want to read my positive quirky outlook on life and could do so without getting sick? so it sat unfinished for a few days, really forgotten until , a friend 'traced' my user name to my 'in name only' blog. the comment that came out of the blue made me feel i was caught. i gave the lame excuse that i had never made my web page so ..... 'you should get on that' okay now i feel i gotta follow through on this since i went  that  far. (for those of you who don't know me i know just enough about computers to be dangerous.) it took me most of a day and TONS of calories burned from frustration! the first seven pages i set up were cool. the next several were okay and the final product is just what i made to get here. actually the page is just a page but cute and useful in it's own right. check it out if you want. that's all for now as two teens are nagging for their (god given) right for a  turn NOW ! welcome to my world.

I hardly update this online journal.  you can find a better updated journal by the same blogger at  urlLink www.livejournal.com/users/t1moune .   I'm soooooooo sleepy.  good night.
I'm no model-material but I must say I love posing for  pictures .  Hehe.  That is why I am trying out BLOGSPOT with it's new photoblogging system through  urlLink hello.com , which makes it so easy to include photos in one's blog.  I'll try this out for a few days or weeks and see if I will be a satisfied customer (well, unpaying customer,that is).  === i love that i was able to  sleep  from 2am to 2pm last 'night'.  I miss that I can sleep for 10-12 hours a night!  Eversince I started working again, I still haven't gotten used to sleeping early.  My body clock really dictates that I sleep at around 2am.  But then, that would mean that I only get around 5-6 hrs of sleep if I want to arrive on time for work.  For some people, that would be more than enough but if I really listen to my body, ideally the amount of sleep i need is 10 hours.  That would mean I won't be cranky the whole day, I'd have enough oxygen in my brain to afford to go jogging at the end of my workday, my skin will not be breaking out with zits or what-have-yous, and i can survive the day without having to go on a food  and diet coke binge.  Really, if I had enough dough to spend on shopping and gimmicks, I 'd put off having to work again for a few more months.  hehehe... Don't get me wrong, though.  Working at  urlLink Jescom  has its own share of perks.  One is, I get to work for social development through the propagation of faith (I work for the Catechists' Foundation of the Philippines under the Jesuit Communications), I was given the opportunity to take on a leadership position (with no one working under me... hahaha) considering the limited length of stay that I could commit to, I am in familiar teritory (the Ateneo, the Katipunan area, JesCom, etc), my co-workers are kind and easy to get along with, among other things...dot..dot..dot...  ====   RSS Reader.   I totally support  urlLink Carlo 's take on the rss reader!  If you view blogs by going to individual websites, give this a try.  It's so convenient to use, you'll thank us for sharing it with you.  :)

so i love photography.  right now, in fact, i am waiting for a guy in washington to post his darkroom stuff on ebay, so i can snatch it up and have pretty much everything i need. we emailed and arranged it ahead of time.  is that right?  what are the ethics of ebay, anyway?  i dunno.  whatever.  all i know is i am excited for this whole thing to finally be within my grasp.   i have been pining over the lack of darkroom because of space, time, and/or money, for over two years.  The soft glow of the dim, red light, the faint smell of chemicals, the excitement of dropping the paper in the developer and watching an image appear, before my very eyes.   excellent.    i love the process of taking pictures and developing film and watching it all come together in my hands.  it's going to become more of an anomaly as the digital age trudges forth, but maybe that will make the old-fashioned stuff all the more special and interesting.  i'm not one to prefer convenience, generally, where artistic endeavors are concerned.  it took me a long time to be comfortable with even buying a digital camera for snapshots, because i was afraid convenience would override my desire to print my own pictures.  it hasn't!  (that's an interesting topic, by the way.  tell me what you prefer, people, and why!)  where is the guy?!? must go check again.....i've hit refresh on my internet browser and checked my email about a hundred times in the last hour......    ooh! he emailed me, saying he's posting it at 1pm!!!   where is it???  it's 1:03.... *sigh*
okay. so i am tired of being fat.    i realize i mentioned the atkins diet in my last (first) blog, and here i am again, about to talk about 'dieting' and being fat again.  one might think this is an ongoing thing for me.  or that i am obsessed with my appearance.  not really.  well, amber might argue with you on that one.  she has accused me on several occasions of obsessively looking in the mirror.  it's weird that i am one to do this, as i rarely like what i see there.  i guess i think if i keep looking, again and again, maybe i'll look better than i did the last time.  sadly, this doesn't seem to happen for me.    anyway, i am tired of being fat, like i said.  so, i have officially decided to change my life and stop mistreating my body by way of neglecting it.  i don't really believe in diets like atkins, or pills like hydroxycut or whatever other ones are out there.  i don't believe in quick, easy fixes.  the only thing that's ever worked for me before is changing what i eat, or how much, and exercising regularly.  period.    so, it's dumb to post about dieting, maybe, but i'm doing it because i'm finally making a decision to really make something happen here, and i consider this a way of holding myself accountable.  maybe i'll post progress on here or something.    my plan is to keep records and charts and all that stuff.  i like to see progress, or i'm get all discouraged and quit.  i'm going to try to write down what i eat, and what i do in the way of exercise, and i'm going to measure my big ole self once a week to see how it's all going.  i'm going to put it all in a folder, and on the folder, i am going to write 'OPERATION STOP BEING FAT' on the front, all decorated-like.  oh yes, my friends.  yes.    post number two.  i'm certainly not any cooler.  maybe i'll be healthier, though.  if anyone has any ideas about exercise or anything, do let me know.
so here it is, ladies and gentlemen.  the blog craze is becoming like as unto the atkins diet, exept that  a) blogging, to me, seems cooler than not eating bread b) see reason a.   beginning a blog now, i feel a bit like i felt when i began to read the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  even though my friends tried to convince me that they were great books, i didn't start reading them until about a month before fellowship came out.  so i was officially not as cool as everybody who read the books based on their own merit, but boy, am i glad i didn't let that stop me from reading them.    anyhow, i named my blog the bandwagon to sort of make fun of myself and my one-step-behind-everyone-else-ness.    what will i write about?  beats me.  i don't have a theme, unless ME is a theme.  oh well.  maybe i will talk about sam, the little baby sitting behind me in his chair.  maybe i will post a quote i like.  maybe i will put some pictures on here or talk about taking pictures or developing them in my almost darkroom ('almost' because it is neither completely dark, nor completely equipped yet).  maybe i will talk about your mom.  i dunno.  anyway, i will post something other than an introduction soon.    later, friends.  *elclang*
crap the bed is what my good-and-no-longer-in-arkansas friend, rhonda, would say when something went wrong.  so i typed a big ole post and titled it 'ketchup,' cause i was catching up on posting.....i am clever. but not clever enough to save changes before i magestically erased them.  *sigh* i will try to recall said  erased  writings and ramblings.  updates on life.  operation:stop being fat! is not a complete failure. i still manage to semi-faithfully drink my giant jug of water. i haven't been so diligent about the notebook and charts and whatnot since vacation early in july. BUT! like i said, it's not all lost. i've dropped about 8 pounds and managed to keep off about 6. it's a start, i suppose.  the darkroom. it's getting there! amber and jess came down a while back for a fun and productive day of light-proofing the closet. it is now splendidly dark, thanks to caulk, insulation, foam, black plastic, and about 200 staples. i've processed 6 rolls of film (successfully!), but i haven't yet printed anything. that, however, may change as soon as today! mom's coming up with the enlarger table, and i bought a safelight bulb yesterday. i actually have two safelight bulbs now, thanks to amber (and sorry about the confusion, by the way)  anyhow, i may get around to it soon. i hope so. life is too busy, and i when i stop to think about what it is i've been doing that eats up all the hours, i can't really see that i've done all that much. is that how life is as you get old?  hmmm.  anyhow, go me for ketching up. i have some introspective-y things to say, but they wouldn't seem to flow here. perhaps i will post another while i wait for mom. i dunno how likely that is - Sam seems to be waking up!
just add another one to the zoo roster... a big fat female robin has recently completed her nest... right outside my kitchen window, in the cross beams of the upstairs apartment's deck... and *RIGHT* over top of my BBQ.  robin doesn't like me very much. whenever I go to use the BBQ, I get chirped at, and it doesn't really sound like a 'hey, how YOU doing' chirp. It's more of a... 'get the heck away from my nest' chirp.   but then robin gets annoyed when I don't leave, and flys away and sits in the grass until I go back inside.   I think it's only a matter of time until I get dive bombed by said robin.
There is khaos in my life... and now there's also reason.  Today my mom called, and said 'I'm not encouraging you, but I'm at this place and they have free kittens. I'd rather you take a free kitten instead of paying another $100 for another kitten'  And that was that.  reason is grey & white with a (currently) black nose. He has four white paws, and he and khaos have been playing for over an hour now.  reason was born about April 1, which makes him almost exactly a month younger than khaos.    I am no longer part of the entertainment in this apartment. I will try to post some pictures on the weekend for you.
heather, i taped it for you. you're going to pee your pants. i think this season finale was written by the person who wrote last season's premiere... yes, it was that good.
I made a doctor's appointment today to deal with what shots i need to get... except the woman at the doctor's office was so completely UNHELPFUL. She actually told me to go call my travel agent and find out what type of shots I need. Nice attitude, for a health care provider.  I checked out the stuff for the conference (ask me via msn and I'll send you the link) and it turns out that I am supposed to be giving a 45 minute presentation on two separate occasions. Or so it looks. Charming.
Well, just got back from the Skar and found out today that I am (for sure) going to brazil in june. for a week... all expenses paid (well, I have to pay for two extra nights accomodation, but air and accomodation are already paid).   I don't know where I am staying, what the hotel will be like... don't even know what to pack. I just know that I have to be part of one seminar (I have to actually talk... UGH) and I have to attend my boss' other seminar... other than that, he said I could probably sneak off one of the days of the conference.  As well, there is a day at the end for all the participants to go on tours/etc. I knew I was sticking around at this job for some reason...
I made it to G'town...  finally. :/ That was some pretty nasty weather!  I got like 1/2 way when it got really bad so I just decided to take it slow and come home...  yeah... Fog + heavy rain + dark = not so nice driving...  especially off of the highway on the side-ish type roads :/
Hmm  is it just you and I reading this Jen?  It is feeling kinda empty at the moment... Get more people :) Just start making up e-mail addresses and send those message things...  we may get some interesting comments hehe
i went to the hospital today with niki and i watched them give her an EEG on her brain. it was amazing. i was so surprised at how much difference there is in brain activity when your eyes are closed / open. really really neat....
last night i must have been thinking about not wanting to go back to school before bed... i had a dream about being late for class, then getting to robart's and not being able to find my classroom... of course the staff at robarts were horrid and un-helpful, and i almost lost my packed lunch. when will the insanity that is school end?  [edit from several hours later] my grades came in today... apparently they haven't kicked me out yet. *sigh* i can hope for next term, right?
in the morning, after being locked out of my room for the better part of the night, khaos is in supreme attack mode. he pounces around my bed, jumping on me... and purring his little furry brain right off. it's hard to take him seriously when he's intent on pouncing on me, but purring like that.
As I was going up the stair, I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish, I wish he'd stay away.    ~Hughes Mearns   The Psycho-Ed
Yeah I have the second post here :)
Starting over from scratch.  If you found your way here, welcome.
Today was another long day! Sight-seeing tour at 9 am (at least I could sleep in a little) and then went to check out a little craft-market... bought some interesting stuff... hit the mall... had McD's - cheeseburger (yes, tastes the same but the salt on the fries is different)... checked out the pool... cold. Went swimming anyway. Then went back to the south pier again... got some beautiful pictures of the area, then went on a spending spree in the surf shop there. Bought lots of things I didn't need to buy... hit the same restaurant as last night for some food... then cabbed it back to the hotel, went back to the mall... Now am very tired, but since some people from the conference have left me two messages since I left earlier today, I have to wait for them to come back again (shortly)...  I just got a call that said I am going on a day-trip tomorrow to a small town outside of the city... should be interesting... now it sort of feels like a vacation, but I've been doing so much I barely have time to sit down!
Well, the conference is finally over. Don't get me wrong - it was a great experience and I met some very interesting people... but when some of the students who were helping to organize/run the conference asked me yesterday if I wanted to go out with them last night, the answer was a very fast 'YES'.  It was so nice to get out and see a little bit of the city, and not have to think about work.  We went to a part of the city called Pontao. I can only describe this as 'tropical, but without the sand'. It was on one side of a man-made lake, and it was beautiful. I didn't get to take too many pictures because I was trying not to be too touristy, but I think I would like to return there today (in the daylight!).   Plus, the currency conversion is very favourable here... one 'real' (their currency) is about .44 of a Canadian Dollar... I think I will go shopping!  time for breakfast!
I have just sat through a twenty minute presentation on a topic that I actually know something about. And the authors made some very, *VERY* scary assumptions to base their work on. It not only annoyed me, it frightened me. They had a period for questions. Normally, IÂ´m content to keep my mouth shut, but today I had to say something. I made a very valid point, speaking from extensive experience, and they, like most academics, really didnÂ´t seem to get my point. Â´Twas ever thus. TheyÂ´re still wrong. Maybe someone else will explain it to them in Portuguese, because I was *very* clear in English... WhatÂ´s scarier than their error though, is the fact that *I* picked it out right away... and it started me thinking: wow... I could write a paper so much more accurately on this topic than they have. (and someone would probably feel the same way about my presentation... vicious cycle!)  Someone shoot me now. Before I become one of them.
i am in brazil... i am trying to figure out how to learn how to say no ice! in portuguese. haven't got it yet. gave my first presentation this morning, it wasn't too bad... but the simultaneous translation into portuguese makes it a little weird - and it's hard to answer question when your little translator radio isn't working...
Hmmm yeah! ummm... what the !@^*@!?!??  you were right...  it was very good though Jen :) I liked the one before too :D and yes for everyone else...  I am that sad :(
Today it was announced that not only will I have to drive to Toronto three times this week in order to pick up the visas for my trip (which I thought was already taken care of), I also have to pay to register for the conference... it's only 180 EUROS, and it HAS to be paid by VISA credit card... of course I have a visa... but i never activated the card because I don't use it.  So tomorrow: drive to my parents to activate the card and fax the registration form.  It's okay, I'll get the 180Euros back as soon as I receive my credit card bill... of course who knows how long the school will take to pay me back and i'll have to cover that bill before they give me the money...  What else is new.  Like i said... how do you spell that word, the one that expresses disgust, stress, annoyance... all rollled into one HEY it's 10:20 and I'd rather be sleeping sound...
mopping effectively with the help of two kittens.  anyone who thinks they can win at this game is welcome to come to my place and give it a go.
drove 30 minutes north stood in a friend's driveway freed a puppy from a goat's pen talked to the goat (without getting attacked by it!) played with the puppy for 45 minutes locked the puppy back in the goat's pen drove 30 minutes south  and talked to my kittens.  can you beat that?
Is it anti-social, or even 'high maintenance' to refuse to leave the confines of your cool, air conditioned basement apartment, and to demand that anyone who wants to see you show up there, when it's this hot and muggy outside? What if I am in here, with the temperature around 12, wearing wool socks and a sweat shirt???
Yes, they changed my flight itinerary. Now I actually have connecting flights that I should be able to make... but the hotel room isn't booked. I hope to make that happen tomorrow.. wish me luck.  It's 10 pm... that means that my kittens have just woken up. They only napped for about half an hour before I woke them both up and tried to get them to play. But for some reason, that half hour nap between 9:00 and 9:30 is enough to keep them going until the wee hours of the night... they prefer to wrestle on my bed while I'm in it.
there have been several plans over past weeks for obtaining a 'cat tree'. partially because I object to my computer chair (which has a nice high back) being used as a cat-climbing aparatus. I also object to it being a vertical cat-wrestling arena...  tonight I went to my parents and my mom and I made a 'cat tree'. a very simple one. plywood bottom & top, 4x4 'trunk', scraps of carpet. Brought it home. It's about 4 feet tall. Got it out of the car. Set it down on the driveway too hard and screwed the bottom up. I guess two of the screws didn't go right into the 4x4. Brought it inside, of course I don't have a drill or appropriate nails to stabilize the base.  Two bungee cords around the pillar in my kitchen did the trick.  But what I want to know is:  How do you bring a foreign object like this into an apartment and the kittens know IMMEDIATELY how to scale it and get on the top?  And if they got up there... why can't they get back down?  The height scares them a little (For the climbing down) so there's a temporary chair beside it now for dismounting.   But then again... khaos just ran into the patio door with his head. eek... need i say more?
well... I am safely back from the travel doctor. My arms aren't hurting *too* much yet, but it's only been an hour... I am now immunized against:  Yellow Fever Hepatitis A Typhoid Fever Tetanus (Psst! You're all due for this if you haven't had it recently!) Diptheria (Psst! You're all due for this if you haven't had it recently!)  I'm still fair game for any regular flu bugs though. I didn't get a flu shot this year and they were out of them at the clinic.  Four needles. $260 including the $50 consultation fee.  That, and there's very little I can eat or drink while I'm there... nothing but bottled water (even to brush my teeth), no fresh fruit or vegetables unless boiled or peeled, no raw meat or seafood (right, because I was going to eat raw meat anyway... LOL) I still have no idea if I can get any of the money back through my health insurance... We shall see :)
fly to NYC first day, 2h 45min layover fly to sao paulo (south of actual destination), arrive 5:15 am second day catch connector flight to brasilia on first day at 9am  on the way back... fly south to sao paulo (day one of flight)... arive at 11:50am fly sao paulo to miami... leave at 11:55pm catch connector flight home several hours later   i was going to plan on practicing a little magic to make that connector flight to brasilia, since i will arrive at the airport a day AFTER the connector flight leaves.  then i was planning on learning guitar and busking at the sao paulo airport for TWELVE hours on the way back.  and my boss wonders why I wanted the 'DETAILS' of the flight itinerary this early... i know they won't change the 12 hour layover, but um, like i said... that flight from sao paulo to brasilia is going to be a little hard for me...
On the weekend, someone stole the lady upstairs' garage door opener from her van.... now she thinks that the person is going to try to come back and open the garage door and come in and try to break into the house. So... we are going to have to lock the front door at night. She's going to get a new remote for the garage door opener, but it bothers me because it's a pain in the ass to have to worry about locking & etc... Plus, now I'll have to lock my patio doors too... it's too bad we can't just let malcolm run free in the house...
Yeah!  Congratulations to me!  I FINALLY got the job I wanted!!! I start later this week or the beginning of next week...    GOODBYE BEING BROKE!!!
It is amazing how well these things go together.  It is starting to get a little frustrating though...  I have watched season 4 up to episode 8...  then I'm screwed. I was able to download episodes 18 and 21 but the rest I am having absolutely no luck finding...  does anyone out there that reads Jen's blog know where I can get season 4 episodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, and 22 (I remember you saying that you had the last one Jen so that one I really don't need I suppose.)  I have tried on Kazaa but as soon as I start to download the other people cancel....  what is with that??? See this is only a problem because I want to watch the ones I have (18 and 21) but you see I don't want to spoil the episodes before it because I know that I will get them eventually. :) o.k.... If you have em or know someone who does PLEEEAAAASEEEEE  let me know...  I need something to feed my boredom!
So I've worked a variety of shifts before but never actual shift work.  Let me tell you people that have not had this wonderful experience for yourself...  it sucks.  My mind is so messed up I don't know when it is day and when it is night or wether or not I should be awake or asleep or tired or not.  Time or day, sun or moon, light or dark...  doesn't matter.  I just worked 3 nights (11:30pm-7:30am) then one day off then 1 day (7:30am-3:30pm) then 3 evenings (3:30pm-11:30pm) then one day off then 1 night (11:30pm-7:30am)  my mind is in a muddle!   I like my new job a lot.  It is very interesting.  Everything was going great up until my shift tonight when...  some crazy bastard threw up on my desk...  the joys of working in health care :(
some girl just came in.... wanted to know if we could scan her report card in and then change the marks and comments on it and print it out.  right.
there is a purring doc marten box on the floor of my living room. it began to purr as i closed the lid with reason inside, and it just didn't stop purring. then it got attacked by khaos, and it continued to purr.   weird. purring shoe boxes.

My head still hurts ::moan::
my head hurts
It's my dad's birthday. Yummy German Chocolate cake for me tonight!!!! At dinner they told us that some of our friends at church invited us to go with them to visit their family in the Philippeans this summer...  Now if we could really go, would that not be INCREDIBLE?????????        I'm already excited, and I'm probably not even going.   Today I feel 'unpretty'  Maggie told me I looked like MY DOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  mean huh?  she didn't really mean it... it was funny oh and my mom took my cell phone away from me for the weekend so if you want to talk to me, you'll have to call the house
We SO should not have been at school today!!!  EVERY other school was out...  Even Rockhurst.  and it was cold... (f***ing cold)  I had five shirts on, two pairs of tights, sweatpants, my skirt...  At least I was warm INSIDE!!!   oh well.
I'm exhausted... I was at church babysitting for my service hours.  Wow kids are a handful!!  One little boy started screaming every time I tried to put him down, It's nice to know I'm so loved, but other kids wanted me to pick them up too...  AHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  My right arm is numb...    My parents are seriously considering letting me transfer to O'Hara, I'm just so incredibly stressed out about school now...  But would I really transfer???  I doubt it.
MICHING MALLECHO... (it means mischief) -- says Hamlet to the fair Ophelia  Finally I have dirt on somebody.  I'm not going to tell you who becuase then I won't be able to use this dirt when and how I want.  (If I were capable of an evil laugh, i would... but it's just not like me!!) I'm depressed again today (NO ITS NOT BeCAUSE OF yOU, YOU PIG-HEADED...)   Today I like the Used again...  this time it 'Bury Me alive'
Where did I see this??? It's pathetic... You would slit my throat and with my one last gasping breath I would apologize for bleeding on your shirt. Is that lyrics to a song or something???  It's stuck in my head. I wrote this the other night... I don't know what's the matter with me...  Anymore it's all crap.  I've had a crappy day, I sit and stare at the girl in the mirror that is not me. I am 2 dimensional. I wonder what you see in her. I don't take off my make-up,  I'm too tired It doesn't matter anyway, I'll just look like a racoom in the morning.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH    BORED OUT OF MY MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I really need to call some people for newspaper, but I really REALLY REALLY don't want to.  I hate newspaper, the only part I like is having my pictures in the paper.  Maybe I'll drop it next year and pick up some art classes so I really can get into Corcoran ( see link at  I found this spiffy Elven site today too.  I need to find somebody to teach it to me, I LOVED it in the movie. I'm sure I'll be back later... Oh what am I listening to right now?:::  korn...   fun stuff
This was on some other guy's blog, its funny: 'so he texted you want to have sex or watch LOTR later? how arrogant. he can go to his damn motels alone. and i've seen LOTR already. ' lol, wow, but then you might not find it funny, I have the oddest sense of humor. I also find this funny... Doubt thou the stars are fire Doubt that the sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love --hamlet
Let's see, who am I in love with today???  Probably the Used.  They're going to be at the Warped Tour, I'm excited!!  Right now I'm listening to Relient K...  Becca made me listen to them last night, and now I'm dying for the cd.  I need to be friends with somebody who listens to good music and can burn these cd's for me, I've only got, like 20, and in this day and age that's very very sad.(Chantele, you're still working on Disturbed for me aren't you?  You can borrow SR-71 if you do lol) Oh and while I'm thinking about it, what do you guys think of the Vines' version of Ms. Jackson??  I laughed the first time I heard it, hated it the second time, and its been growing on me ever since. Today I pinned my hair up, it looked incredibly cool, rather like Padme's in Ep. 2 when its all loopy, ya' know? But now I have a headache from having those pins stuck into my scalp all day. lol, yeah you GUYS, you just don't understand.  It hurts like hell. And apparently, there have been rumors going around about me being suicidal?  Well, I'm not.  I'm about as close as you can get without actually being suicidal, and making a comeback, so don't worry about me, I'm fine really!!!! We discovered today that I'm a little on the stubborn prideful side... basically, once I've done something... I've not going back on it, even when I do regret it... poor me. Oh and last night I decided that Marshmallow Fluff is supposed to be refrigerated, just so you know. (lol) PS...  you guys might call me tonight, make sure I haven't passed out, I rather feel like it just now
I knew you guys shouldn't have let me sit at home by myself tonight.  I've been reading Margret Atwood. My favorite quotes from books come from her, and I'm really bored (aren't I always??  I say that every night)  so I'm going to type them all out so I have them all in one place. --' 'It's absolutely no use saying you should stop loving someone.  It doesn't work like that!'     'Well you should if you know its bad for you,' said Charis.    'Bad for you had nothing to do with it,' said Roz.   'I like hamburgers,' said Charis, 'but I don't eat them.'    'Hamburgers are not an emotion,' said Roz.    'Yes they are,' said Charis.                                             --Robber Bride  (that one's my favorite)  'On that day, blood ran like water, so afterwards it must have been very clean.'                                                       --the Blind Assasin  'I am a fool to confuse this with goodness. I am not good.  I know too much to be good.  I know myself. I know myself to be vengeful, greedy, secretive, and sly.                                       --Cat's Eye  'I think about becoming invisible.  I think about eating the deadly nightshade berries from the bushes beside the path.  I think about drinking the Javex out of the skull and cross bones bottle in the laundry room, about jumping off the bridge, smashing down there like a pumkin, half of an eye, half of a grin.  I would come apart like that, I would be dead, like the dead people. I don't want to do these things, I'm afraid of them.  BUt I think about her telling me to do them, not in her scornful voice, in her kind one.  I hear her kind voice inside my head.   Do it. Come on.  I would be doing these things to please her.'                                -- Cat's Eye
AHHH, I'm bored out of my mind.  Today I'm in love with All American Rejects..  If you didn't notice earlier...lol.  There's a song, on their website, Don't Leave Me, I love it.  And I'm just listening to this song by spoon???  its interesting
yes I'm back again.. I feel like ranting, the snow is melting.  Last night was the last straw, but now I'm left with an empty cup. Nothing is ever what it seems, and once again, I've brought this on myself, and for me there is no going back, Will you catch up?  The tears will not fall, but the pain will go away.  I sit and laugh, because I have been here before and will be here again. Its okay, I'll live, I always do, its my sense of humor that saves me.  Sarcastic as it may be, and as much as you may hate it, It has saved me, I would have gone long ago if not for it, my trusty shield, you never got as close as you could have, it saved me.  It ruined me. hm, rather abstract tonight, huh?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   All American Rejects comes out Feb. 4th, Don't let me forget!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The snow is GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I've already gone out and shot 2 rolls of film this morning.  I love my Baby. (NO CHANTELE, YOU WERE NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO NAME IT THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  yeah, um back to the snow...  Its weird how Bobby has picked up my snow day habits.  Snow days are the only no school days that you don't sleep in.  We get up, put on  a ton of clothes and go out into the woods and look for animal tracks.  We always walk single file, to mess up less snow.  The only reason Bobby does it is because he knows I would SMACK him if he didn't. (hee hee)  Oh and I wrote this last night too: The girl is beautiful her pale silouette outlined against the dark hair  spread across her pillow Glowing in the light reflected off the snow outside her window she is beautiful and so am I  Its pretty crappy, but I thought you'd like it (yes you Chantele)
Today we had fun.  I threw a banana at Chantele, and we discovered my lightning fast reflexes.  Chantele and I also decided that we were going to take over the world like Alexander the Great... It will most likely entail having affairs with world politicians and then poisoning them at breakfast. Poor Sama lost her voice and had to call us really REALLY bad names to get us to pay attention to her.  I would also like to take this opportunity to point out the fact that I am MADLY in love with Joel from gc, and Deryk (?) from Sum 41.  MADLy i tell you.  Well I suppose I'm done for now.  I'm horridly tired and bored, I need to get out of this house!!!!!!!!!!!
Its really weird how everyone feels so overprotective of me, I mean, my parents...  Need I say more???  And I found out today that Chantele's been threatening people with the 'If you ever hurt her...'  Some of my friends won't even hug me because they think their gonna 'break' me. I hear the 'DOn't do anything I would do' thing all the time too.  WHy is it that everyone I know is so bad that they have to warn me that whatever it is their doing is wrong?  Io it bugs me.  I like a certain amount of protectiveness from my guys, its cute, but I get tired of it after awhile.  Oh and what's up with this nickname for Rachel thing? I have a gazillion different names.  Rachella... rather reminicent of Cinderella.  Popo...  not quite so much of a 'poet pope' any more...  My papal visions have gone Kaput.  Um..  Baby- Reminds me too much of that wonderful performance of mine in the Fall play, and besides, that's my camera's name.  Poke...  no I don't like it when people touch w/o some kind of prior warning, but its neccessary to remind everyone of this new kind of entertainment... 'Watch Rachel Cringe'????  BE A JEAN!  (that was for Chantilly)  Let's see... what else?  SHeep...  baaaa?  NO. RaeRae...  doesn't bother me so much, I'll answer to it but I didn't win state in soccar last year!!! The list is endless..  poor me.
Funny thing, life is.  You know, its really cool to think about the millions/thousands of people you meet/see/walk past in your lifetime that all have this unseen force in them that gives them the ability to walk/think/gain intelligence etc.  I was babysitting this little two year old boy last night and he fell asleep on my shoulder, it was so cute, I love the feeling of having a sleeping child in my arms. I wonder if I'll ever end up having my own kids, creating life...  hmmm...
I wonder what's the matter with me?   I've been the BIGGEST bitch lately, and I'm not really like that.  I want to lay down and die.  If it were that easy, I probably would too!!  Too bad I'd never really be able to do it. Oh well. While I'm thinking about it, someone needs to come up with a name for me...   Some guy came up to me the other night and called me Xyloa...  I'm afraid to find out what that means, in elvish, or whatever it is. But then its not like I ever actually play D&D, I just hear Chantele's stories, and Kevin really wanted me to play with him at one time, except I don't think he does that kind of stuff anymore, now that he's converted to Daoism. Poor me. I'm so bored...
UHG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have to go to school in the morning, I think I'll cry.  I felt like crying this morning when I woke up. (Of course I didn't.  I need to stop that, someday, I think I'll die from withheld tears or something)  I get like that sometimes, its weird.  My mom thinks its hormones, but I really don't think so, I know what hormones feels like.  I'm just moody. (wow, I picked a good name for this, I'm already ranting.) I HATE confirmation class.  I hate every single person in the class except for Kristy, Jessica, and Rachel (no not me, I'm not quite THAT pigheaded)  You should have seen Larry, I wanted to kill him...  No wait, I take that back, I shouldn't be that mean.  He REALLY REALLY REALLY pissed me off, just by being alive.  Can't you tell I'm in a horrid mood tonight? I WANT IT TO RAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It started sprinkling yesterday and got me all excited, and the clouds were really cool, and it SMELLED like rain, I could even SEE it raining in the distance, but what did I get?  Disappointment. Ok, Chantele needs a name for her mag, what'll it be?  huh?  huh?  Didn't think so.
I've had a really good past couple days.  Wednesday I found out I'm going to be photo editor of the newspaper next year.  That means I'll get to spend all my time taking pictures, and will have to write very few, if any, stories for the paper.  Even though Mr. Thomas said  that considering my past couple stories, I'm a completely different writer than I was at the beginning of the year (that's a really good thing, I sucked so bad at the beginning of the year)  and since the juniors and seniors have been gone all week, I've been the only person in my newspaper classes, so Mr.Thomas has been talking to me about photography...  He's sort of taken me on as his 'apprentice'  and he was showing me different techniques and stuff.  It was fun.  So yeah there's that, and its snowed the past couple days, which makes me happy, and Andrew and I actually had a civil conversation yesterday!!!  Oh, and I haven't had any homework all week, so that's a TON of stuff I don't have to worry about this week, although I should probably go do some of the Latin due on Monday...  Nah.  I'm such a slacker.  Speaking of Latin, the JCL test is in a couple weeks, its a standardized international Latin test.  Last year I did really well on it..  Magna cum Laude or something... I got a silver medal... Only Kate did better, but that doesn't really bother me.... I'm NEVER going to do better than Kate, freaking GENIUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ok well, who knows what I'm doing tonight, I may be around, I may not, but if you call and I don't answer, leave me a message... I'll probably either be talking to Chantele on the phone, or at a rave and can't hear my phone... lol, jk...  I'm not going to a Rave... yes Kevin I'm sure.  I'm NOT GOING TO GET MYSELF HIGH!!!  nor have I ever done such a thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hee hee, my music favorites files full...  I'm  gonna have to start sub dividing my bands... how sad. Interesting stuff tonight.  I'm so tired, I think I'm going to bed.
oh and go listen to Gershwin's rhapsody in blue...  that's the mood I'm in right now
Its okay, I'll live, I always do. :~)   We went to the dedication of the cathedral today, and I saw a ton of people that I know.  It feels really good to walk through a church that big, and get stopped every couple of seconds by people I know.  A friend of my mom's hadn't seen me in around four years, and he didn't even really recognize me, he just looked at me, and I smiled and waved at him.  He came over and was like, You're... You're...  so I told him who I was and he like freaked out.  He was like wow...  you're a lot older now, you've gotten to be absolutely gorgeous.  I hate it when people tell me that...  I know its not true, but sometimes its still nice to hear that someone really thinks so.
UGH!!! my parents... I think my dad is having a midlife crisis, and my mom's starting menopause... oh god!
let's see... tomorrow night is the charity volleyball game at Rockhurst...  let me take this opportunity to say that the Rock is going to be ground into dust, they just can't take the heat of the stars...  but then Friday we're playing sion, and THAT storm is DEFINATELY going to blow  over.  and I think we're doing something with Ish too.  I think Chantele's going to spend the night, and then Saturday morning is the rededication of the Cathedral...  which I got tickets to because of our leadership role in the youth world of the Diocese  (yeah I know, where the hell did they come up with my name?)   Saturday night is the battle of the bands at Rockhurst, which is going to be great... and something must be happening sunday.. hmmm I'm listening to Relient K, and Home Grown...    oh and that one song...  Make up your mind....   who sings that???????
look what maggie wrote: . hate. you.  i hate you like halogen lights  i hate you like wet socks  i hate you like no sleep nights  i hate you like 'we need to talk's  you disgust me.  i hate you like jealousy  i hate you like boys  i hate you so violently  i hate you; i have no choice  i. hate. you. trust me.   and then i would add: and yet, for some reason, I still love you.
I was over at sama's house last night, working on our history project, which is a comparison of indian and american weddings, and i found this poem: 'Give me a kiss, and to that kiss a score; Then to that twenty, add a hundred more: A thousand to that hundred: so kiss on, To make that thousand up a million. Treble that million, and when that is done, Let's kiss afresh, as when we first begun.' -Robert Herrick Its really funny, and those of you that need to know why its funny, know
wayway  WAY too much sugar yesterday... but we had fun last night. Mary and I drove around for a couple hours after school, we went to her house, and then Sid's house.  Maggie, Lauren and Elise came by.  We went to Winstead's and watched Lauren be mean to her date, and then we went and saw How to lose a guy in 10 days.  There were a whole bunch of drunk freshmen in the row in front of us and we made fun of them.  I missed the last 15 min of the movie though because Chantele had to leave at 9:40 and couldn't go by herself... Her parents think she's going to get mobbed
Supposedly I'm cute today..  what ever am I going to do with you people?????????   Right now I'm listening to Green Day...  At the Library...  I'm in love.  I talked to Cindy for like an hour last night about stuff, I feel better now.
I'm so tired of doing this...   what's this you ask?  well, since no one really reads this, I could tell you, but then with my luck, someone, like just the person I don't want reading this particular thing, would come and read it..  haa haa. funny isn't it, that's how my life works. I was talking to Cindy today, and she said Mary Mueller wants Chantele and I to go to the rededication of the Cathedral, and representatives of Youth Leadership in the Diocese...  Wow, Youth Leadership in the diocese, and MY name comes up??  ha ha, I like that.  Of course we're going, and we're both really excited. the Father/Daughter Dance is tonight at Union Station.  Its more like a costume ball than anything else I've ever been to.  My dad and I are going as Woody and Little Bo Peep, from Toy Story.  I'm gonna be stuck all night with people telling me how incredibly cute I am. Speaking of people calling me cute, I need to explain about my problem with this.   I get called cute ALL THE TIME, and quite frankly, am VERY sick of it.  Even at HYU, I LOSE MY VOICE, and its ADORABLE!!!  At church Its all I hear too, I f you must say something, tell me I'm unbelievably gorgeous, Please.
Fav. Verse from a song: Mama and Daddy's got the best cocaine Riddellin's (sp?) never gonna be the same 24 hours on an empty brain I've got my finger on the trigger and you're in my way                         --Sugarcult, Bouncing off the Walls  --- band newly discovered by me today::  Erase the Grey...  read the lyrics to Rain, they amuse me. also still intrigued by the title of Audiovent's last album:: 'Dirty Sexy Knights in Paris'  yummy
i've decided no one reads this anyway so I can write whatever the hell I want...  but now I can't think of anything evil to say... oh well
HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We had fun.  We went to Town Center and I bought Kate a shirt that said spin my driedel (lol)  and I bought me a new ring, and got yelled at for wearing it upside down...  long story...  don't ask.  Then we went bowling and scored like a 57 or something.  My name also changed several times through out the night  i started out rae rae, but then I was Poke (seriously, this 'let's watch Rachel cringe and laugh at her hysterically' thing is REALLY not funny.)  and then later it something else, and then VVVVVVVVVVVVV m...  again, don't ask.  Sama was having control issues with the computer, hah a We went back to Kate's house after that and watched 10 things I hate about you (one of my favorite movies, aaaaahhhh  Heath Ledger...  HOTTIE!!) and a Walk to Remember, and guess what, a TEAR ACTUALLY ROLLED DOWN MY CHEEK!!!  what is that, the first time since HYU? and I'm not even gonna go into what happened this morning,   I don't even really know, i just woke up with Chantele sitting on me, grinning evily, holding my cell phone...   I think she was harrassing Andrew...  UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
today was weird, We had our NHS induction assembly, which made me feel lazy and worthless, but after that I had fun.  I felt loved today. except for Chantele I swear to god some day i'm going to beat the crap out of her.  But yeah, London ditched school and came back and told us all about it...  stupid girl.  In newspaper, Katy took my second story so I have less work to do now... I've got all kinds of pictures to take, but that's a good thing.  Then I was talking to Britanny, she's going to be editor of the Dart next year.  She was talking to me, and then all of a sudden she goes, 'Oh my god, you are SO gorgeous.  I can't believe you don't have like 5 boyfriends.'  I was rather shocked to hear her say this, partially because SHE'S the one who's gorgeous, and people don't normally tell me I'm gorgeous.  I'm alway cute.  But that's only one of the reasons I hate it when people call me that. People always tell me my hair is really pretty, but I'm never pretty. but that's only one of the reasons I want to chop it off.  hmmm... While on the subject of my appearance, I would like to talk about how everone thinks I'm anerexically skinny.  Its funny really.  My mom tells me I'm fat all the time, and yells at me if I eat more than she thinks I should... I really don't eat that much anyway... but I guess she thinks so.  But then If I should decide to skip a meal, THEN she drags my dad into and they practially shove food down my throat.  Its so weird.  Should you ask Chantele, she would tell you that I'm really normal sized and that I fake being skinny...  She will..  and seriously mean it too..  ugh  When I'm really skipping meals though, nobody notices... I probably shouldn't say this, but then wait, no one reads this anyway so it doesn't matter...  I can go for weeks without eating virtually anything, and no one will notice... But then I start eating again for a while... It all depends on the mood I'm in.  Oh well.
another day gone by...  It's weird some times to observe time passing...  relativity, what and interesting concept... you know its true, the barriers of time are only in your mind.  What would you do if you were some where with no clocks, and you couldn't see the sun to see the day pass by...  what would it be like?  Hmmm??? Would you know several hours had passed when you were hungry again?  or would you never be hungry because to you, no time had passed what so ever?  I wonder how long the next six years are going to seem, if I live to see the next six years that is.
... wow, its been a while hasn't it???   hmmm... there's lots of stuff i feasibly CoULd tell you, but probably shouldn't, since its NONE of your business...  Spring break just got over, I'm already hating school again.  The break was quite interesting... I went to TEC, and met some really cool people, and got a chance to recenter my self, In most ways anyway... I got WAY off in other ways.  Monday I was in the most bizarre mood and said things I shouldn't have.  Tuesday night Chantele came over and I talked to Andrew some... Wednesday and Thursday were mostly uneventful, Friday night I talked to Andrew for five hours on the phone... i was happy after that, Saturday was a good day until my parents ruined it, and Sunday I was at church half the day, then I realized that i was going to have to go back to school today and did a little freaking out, and then I talked to Andrew some more...   So yeah that's my break... and then today???  I HATE Ms. Rowland (latin teacher)  I don't know anyone else in the WORLD that could make me feel so STUPID!!!!!!!!!  oh well.  CALL ME I'M BOReD>>>  luv y'all
Goodbye, he said to the flower. But she made no answer. Goodbye, he said again. The flower coughed.  But it was not because she had a cold. I have been silly, she said to him at last, I ask your forgiveness.  Try to be happy He was surprised by this absence of reproached.  He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid air.  He did not understand this quiet sweetness. Of course I love you the flower said to him. It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance.  But you- you have been just as foolish as I.  Try to be happy Let the glass globe be.  I dont want it any more. But the wind - My cold is not so bad as all that The cool night air will do me good.  I am a flower. But the animals- Well I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies.  It seems to me that they are very beautiful.  And if not the butterflies- and the caterpillars- who will call upon me?  You will be far awayAs for the large animals- I am not at all afraid of them.  I have my claws. And, naively, she showed her four thorns.  Then she added: Dont linger like this.  You have decided to go away.  Now go! For she did not want him to see her crying.  She was such a proud flower. -The Little Prince Antoine de Saint Exupery
DAMN IT Let's see... what shall I pretend today?
Don't think I don't see... These opaque eyes of mine see everything EVERYTHING Don't think I don't know I was never as nieve as you thought I was I see I know  EVERYTHING
the irises are blooming the irises of my eyes blooming like the blood on the white sheets blooming like the bodies buried, hidden coming up roses here's the knife let me carve out the part that hurts lay it on the altar an offering
I love this weather, I thrive on tank tops, shorts, and playing in the rain...  Of course I love the snow and all, but the rain's so much better.  I love going out and getting soaked to the skin, feeling the drops hit my face... and I love the sound of thunder. It sends chills down my spine every time I hear it.  mmm...  Just thinking about it makes me smile.  Supposedly I haven't been able to stop smiling all day.  I had Latin first thing this morning, and London was singing at the top of her lungs...  Oh it was the funniest thing ever, I laughed so hard I had tears streaming down my face. (Note:  London could NOT sing if her life depended on it, it was more like screeching, but I think she was doing that on purpose.)  What else happened today...  I finished my newspaper story, so I don't have to worry about that any more, and Mr. Thomas said it was a good story, which made me feel better because, I thought it was crap... Supposedly I'm overly critical of myself, because I hate most of the pictures I take, I hate everything I write, everything I do is always screwed up, but people are like... Rachel, this is incredible, what's your problem?  oh well... maybe that's a good thing though, because then I try harder... maybe.  hmm... It just occured to me that I haven't written in a couple of weeks, in which a lot of things have happened, but the only person who now even knows where this is (that'd be you Andrew)  knows all that stuff, so I don't need to worry about it anyway.  :-)
Ok, let me put it this way, I'm listening to Konstantine, on purpose.
::sigh::
what a pretty rain.  It used  to make me happy...  now it...now it... i don't know how to explain it to you... its like... I know it used to make me happy, and now it pelts every mistake into my soul...  and that's still not quite it.  the thunder still gives me goosebumps though..    I'm in an off mood right now.  I'm tired of being me again...  but that's nothing new.  it doesn't matter anymore anyway.  I want to go home, curl up in my bed, and never do anything ever again.
silence ringing monotony a metal rod driven through my head. It cannot  touch me it is not solid  not a true quantity It cannot  touch me it cannot make me cry you are solid but still not a true quantity you can  touch me you can  make me cry
Shelley sent me these lyrics.  I found that rather amusing... This will NOT happen. John Mayer - 3x5 lyrics I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been You held this letter probably got excited, but there's nothing else inside it  didn't have a camera by my side this time hopping I would see the world with both my eyes maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm in the mood to lose my way with words  Today skies are painted colors of a cowboy's cliche' And strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky are next to mountains anyway  Didn't have a camera by my side this time Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes Maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm in the mood to lose my way but let me say  You should have seen that sunrise with your own eyes it brought me back to life You'll be with me next time I go outside just no more 3x5's  Guess you had to be there Guess you had to be with me  Today I finally overcame tryin' to fit the world inside a picture frame Maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm in the mood to lose my way but let me say  You should have seen that sunrise with your own eyes it brought me back to life You'll be with me next time I go outside just no more 3x5's no more 3x5's
so I fixed the quotes....   wow.  Really, I am just not capable of typing a whole word without screwing it up.   Seriously, I've backspaced about a hundred times already just typing this.  I think I'm getting sick too.  One of the guys from the St. Louis office called this morning, and when I answered the phone he said I sounded like I had been into some bad whiskey this weekend.  I told him not to tell my dad.  It was kind of funny.  I seriously can not wait till next week.  I need out of the house SO INCREDIBLY BAD.  I can go to HYU  have fun with people who don't need to know anything about me, and forget about my real life.  The thought is horribly pleasing.  If only I knew it was going to be the same as last year though,  that was fun.  Oh well, we'll see.
ugh.  I got my grade card and summer reading list today.  ugh.  I somehow managed to pull off a 3.4  ::sigh::    It's not like there was ANYTHING I could do about my morality grade.  Everyone knows that's ridiculous.   Oh well.
So I've been reading Margaret Atwood again...  It's almost like listening to Konstantine.   Anyway, I've got to keep these quotes somewhere...  otherwise I'll forget them. 'I'm stuck on that wretched term paper.  Once I went to the zoo and there was a cage with a frenzied armadillo in it going around in figure-eights, just around and around the same path.  I can still remember the funny metallic sound its feet made on the bottom of the cage.   They say all caged animals get that way when they're caged, it's a form of psychosis, and even if you set the animals free after they go like that they'll just run around in the same pattern.  You read and read the material and after you've read the twentieth article you can't make any sense out of it any more, and then you start thinking about the number of books that are published in any given year in any given moth, and in any given week and that's just too much. Words,' he said, looking in my direction finally, but with his eyes strangely unfoucused, as though he was really looking at a poin several inches beneath my skin, 'are beginning to lose their meanings.'                                                        -The Edible Woman  And this is the one I'm reading now, this is how it starts: 'I don't know how I should live.  I don't know how anyone should live.  All I know is how I do live.  I live like a  peeled snail.  And that's no way to make money. I want that shell back, it took me long enought to make.  You've got it with you, wherever you are.  You were good at removing.  I want a shell like a sequined dress, made of silver nickels and dimes and dollars overlappin like the scales of an armadillo.  Armored dildo.  Impermeable; like a French raincoat. I wish I didn't have to think about you.  You wanted to impress me; well I'm not impressed, I'm disgusted.  That was a disgusting thing to do, childish and stupid.  A tantrum, smashing a doll, but what you smashed was your own head, your own  body.  You wanted to make damn good and sure I'd never be able to turn over in bed again with out feeling that body beside me, not there, but tangible, like a leg that's been cut off.  Gone but the place still hurts.  You wanted me to cry, mourn, sit in a rocker with a black-edged handkerchief, bleeding from the eyes.  But I'm not crying, I'm angry.   I'm so angry I could kill you.  If you hadn't already done that for yourself.'                                                                      -Life before Man.  I wish I could write like Margaret Atwood.  I love reading her books.  They are examples of books that are not junk. ... that I can actually lose my self in.   I can be depressed because of the book, instead of being depressed because of my life.  That's a good thing.  Samantha was talking about how 'fiberous' I am.  She said everything I do has something to do with paper.  I love paper, I love the way it feels.  Its very personal.  That's why I write letters to people so much.  I don't know anyone else who does that.  I just sit there and think...  I should write to so and so... and so I do.  They mean more effort than just calling somebody up, you have to spend 37 cents for a stamp and actually put it in the mail.  Taking the effort means its important to you.  I wish people would realize that.      I really have been sick of myself lately.    I wonder what's the matter with me.   Well, I know what's the matter with me... But I should have figured that out by now... It's the same old....'I'll be fine.'  'I'll be fine.'  I keep telling myself that... Maybe eventually I'll believe it,  maybe eventually I will be fine...  Maybe I'll be better than fine.  Maybe I'll be happy.   Those words echo over and over again in my head...  Maybe... eventually... Someday...    and I think, 'ugh.'
::drum roll please:: AND THE RESULTS ARE:   I didn't do nearly as bad as I said/thought I was going to.  C's stand for 'special Commendation'  and A's stand for 'Needs Attention'  therefore, c's are better than a's.  I had 34 C's, with things like 'Wow!' and 'Beautiful' and 'YES!' written after them, and I knew I was going to get those 3  A's, I was so nervous, my left hand was a quarter of a beat ahead of my right hand (UHG!)  and I really screwed up my scales (as usual.)  So yes Bobby did better than I did, He got 34 C's and no A's... so its not really THAT much better, and he had easy peasy songs. but still, its the principal of the thing.  oh well  ::sigh::  I've been doing a lot of 'oh well-ing' and sigh-ing lately... does that tell you anything about the kind of mood I'm in?  ::sigh::  :-)   My parents are coming home tonight so I should probably go get some work done.  ::sigh::
mmm.. I like this one better anyway So, we all knew I was going to do this.  Today is the day of my competition and I can't remember a note of either of the songs I'm supposed to play.  I can't even play my scales.  I am so incredibly nervous.  I knew I was going to screw it up.  Oh well.  and then I have to go and have lessons with my teacher right after that.  but then we don't get our results till next week, so she won't be able to yell at me for how horrible I did until then.  Bobby'll go and do incredibly well, and I will have SUCKED!!!!!  oh well.  This was supposed to keep my mind off of other things I didn't want to think about but now I don't want to think about this either.  I really need to figure out how to stop thinking all together.  That would be so much easier, no emotions, no intelligence, I envy those   people who are vegetables.   I think I would enjoy that blissful oblivion.  No such luck though I guess.  I've got to go though... guess why... Bobby wants to use the computer  (which makes sense, I stole it from him in the first place, but hey, it used to be my computer.)

Who are you? oh,           you would be                          ... one of them. I'll shake my head in disgust                       of you. pull my hat down over one eye,                   so I'm mysterious.       Aren't I mysterious? See me disappear, all that's left is the mist...                    reach out,                                    touch the place where I was... but don't cling to it,  its dangerous to your health.    lol... who ever it was who called me a poet was sadly mistaken {duh, it was kate... THAT's where the second half of popo came from... I was the poet pope, lol} .  I'm just random.
Bless you               {you sneezed}

why? because its always like this. and I don't want it like this. .:deep breath:. I've had my signs.
I should know better than to do this to myself. Haven't I learned my lesson?
This world is so beautiful.   I'm tired.  and kind of sad today. I think I'll go take a shower, and then... retire to my quarters... .:I'm reading a book about Eleanor of Aquitaine:.
I went shopping today.  :-)  I bought two dresses, on sale.  heehee, its kinda funny, they're completely different.  One's like fire engine red, and comes just past my knees, sort of retro 50's-ish I guess, and the other one is white and has a huge full skirt of layered tulle, like a cloud.  Its really pretty.  I love trying on formal dresses.  They make me feel pretty.  like Maria...  {... I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty, and witty, and bright! and I pity, yes I pity, any girl who isn't me tonight...    sad, that I can type those from memory isn't it?}  anyway...  and I went to visit Rebecca and gave her her birthday present finally...  her birthday is in September. lol.  Tomorrow I'm driving to Rolla... I want to stay home and talk to my friends... well, everybody's leaving tomorrow too, oh well.  .:sigh:.   Last night, I had the most fun sitting in my room by myself I think I've ever had. {wow, that makes me sound like a pathetic loser doesn't it?}   I was on the phone with Samantha and Chantele... wow, I had forgotten how much fun we have when the three of us are together.  and I had forgotten how incredibly insane Chantele is.  We were joking around about her boyfriend Ben's evil laugh {which is incredibly scary}  so she calls him on her cell phone, and sticks it up next to the other phone and makes him do it over the phone...   Its even scarier that way.  lol.
My family means the world to me. They've always been there for me, and I think I know that no matter what I do they will always love me. I have never been as grateful for them as I should be, but I will always love them too, and I would never consciously do anything to hurt them. I hope that I'm the kind of person who would never intentionally hurt anyone, especially those people who are so very close to me. I seem to have forgotten all of this though. Sometimes my frustrations get the better of me. I feel horrible. I'm sorry. I seem to have found a way to mess everything up lately. I'm sorry.
Yay, I drove home tonight with my radio blasting this [VVV] song, I'm in a pretty good mood again... You people always make me feel better.  Saves the Day  See You   My gut is burning. Won't you find me some water? Hey, just forget it can you bring me gasoline and collect a couple forks, hold them three feet apart and wait for lightning to strike to burn me up? Cause I don't think that I've got the stomach to stomach calling you today. My head is swirling. It's been carried off in the sky and where it lands is where is lands. So I guess that I will get another head and then get on with my life and leave you somewhere beneath the waves of time. And I'll wear glass shoes and plastic wrap. No, I'll just wear my insides. You want to know who I really am? Yeah so do I, yeah so do I. Cause I don't think that I've got the stomach to stomach calling you today. Right now I am turning off the lights cause I don't think that I've got the stomach to stomach calling you today.
don't you know i was never ready for any of the things you said? i can count the years i've lived      {the years that have passed me by} on my fingers and toes... so can you, but only in reality. don't you know that i am going to be happy? don't you know i won't cry for you anymore? don't you know that it IS better this way? {whether you like it or not?} don't you know that SOMEDAY IS NOT TOMORROW? {not even today} don't you know that you were never even real? you were a dream              or maybe a nightmare I'm waking up now. don't you know? haven't you always known? I'm waking up now.
So I'm back again... I'm bored today.   You know, I had forgotten how depressing Dashboard Confessional is...  That sort of deflated my 'happy balloon' {wow, what a dork}  but I'm still in a pretty good mood...  I have youth group stuff tonight, and I'm hoping Sama and Chantele and I are going to see Legally Blonde 2 tomorrow night {just because we're really cool like that... we need a girl's night out anyway, what better way to solve that problem than to go  see the biggest chic flic ever??????}  and I was planning on going out Friday night...  but somebody decided he didn't want to pay his brother to drive him out to lee's summit >:-I  {jk... you know I luv you-- but you better get your insurance soon!!}  Saturday is my cousin's wedding reception thing, I guess... they had a little civil court house ceremony, and they're just having a party in some park in Rolla {yay!  more sun for Rachel... at this rate, i just might not be paper white when school starts}
mmmm....  This past week has been really good.  I'm happy again.  {which is a good thing, because I eat more when I'm depressed}  I love my friends {I love you guys}  I spent all day yesterday having fun with Lisa and David and Stephanie, and then came  home, talked to Sama for an hour and a half, went to bed at like 8:45... I love knowing that there are people who really care about me, that I can trust.  I really am so happy today, I just want to wrap it around me, and curl up back in bed and sleep all day, being happy {because if I'm awake something's bound to ruin it} Of course I still have bad thoughts floating around in the back of my mind... but I'm not letting them surface at the moment.  I'll just deal with those bridges when I come to them :-)
I LOVED Thoroughly Modern Millie... it was so much fun!!  I think i have a new favorite musical... well next to West side Story of course... that'll always have a place dear to my heart.  I hate people who are inconsistant. {don't be inconsistant} I want someone to send me flowers... lol, just kidding. tomorrow i get to go to Worlds of Fun with Tiffany and Aaron and Stephen and Alex and maybe Jason  and all those people.  I'm excited.  I always have fun with those people..
I had  so  much fun last night... We all went over to Tiffany's house and everybody else went swimming... and I thought I had done a good job keeping myself dry lol.  I ended up quite wet thank you very much.  hee hee... So much fun.  Tonight my confirmation sponsor and her husband are coming over for dinner.  My mom's going crazy.  Tomorrow night I'm going to Thoroughly Modern Millie with my dad (yay!)
Oh, you should have seen the sunrise when I woke up this morning.  The sun wasn't even up at all yet, the light was just barely starting to reflecting off the clouds.  It was that blood red color that only the sunrise has, and there were only a few touches of it, it looked like paint brush strokes.  I wanted a fisheye filter for my camera to contort it, but those things cost a lot.
I want to be superficial.  I have this song stuck in my head Sugarcult - Hate Every Beautiful Day lyrics Something's gotta change again I'm losing, my inspirations gone, oh no oh no Seeing through some different eyes I can't find, my medications failed, again again  I can feel a change I can feel, can you feel it See it on the street watching heat from the pavement  Cause I'm here, ready to take it all here Everything's feeling unclear I wish it was raining Cause I hate every beautiful day  Faces in the crowd Fake smiles for miles My imitations wrong of them again Trapped inside this cheap hotel Bored as hell turing the channels 'round  I can feel a change I can feel, can you feel it See it on the street watching heat from the pavement  Cause I'm here, ready to take it all here Everything's feeling unclear I wish it was raining Cause I hate every beautiful day  I can feel a change I can feel, can you feel it See it on the street watching heat from the pavement  I can feel a change I can feel, can you feel it I'm not the same, not the same lost my feeling  All I know I'll never know All I know I'll never know  Cause I'm here, ready to take it all here Everything's feeling unclear I wish it was raining Cause I hate every beautiful day Every beautiful day Every beautiful day Every beautiful day    It doesn't mean anything... just that I listen to this cd WAY too much
urlLink This is my aunt's ranch.   I'm so random.  Oh my god.  I just found out that the brother of one of the guys i went to grade school with was electrocuted to death.  I never particularly liked Brady or his brother, but the guy was only 18... what a horrible thing to happen.  Its all in the newspaper too.  urlLink article   Crappy week.  I had fun last night at church though.  I don't think I've laughed that hard in a really long time.  {ask me about it some time, it was quite an amusing story}  funny isn't it? Tuesday night I was crying, Wednesday night, i'm laughing.   .:sigh:.  that's my life for you ;-) ugh.
What can I say?     I have too much pride for my own good. My mom wants to know if anybody besides her knows how horribly depressed I really am. Do you know?  You can't possibly. I'm very good at hiding it.  I'm getting no where. I'm going no where. I need out of  here. There isn't anywhere to go?  Yes, I know I'm being vague.  Assume what you like. It doesn't matter anyway. Nothing matters anymore.
so, I completely snapped last night.  I just really couldn't deal with the stress anymore. I don't think I've cried like that since I was five.  I was violently sobbing {as much as I hate to admit it}  and I couldn't stop.  I think I cried for almost an hour.  It was really horrible.  I feel better now though, I've released all that anxiety.
There's an article in the paper about how three local golf courses' pro shops were broken into last night.  Its a mystery!  Just think, I could go, and gather clues... and be just like Nancy Drew!  I can see it now... My books would be green, instead of that weird yellow color, and the very first one, with a giant #1 on the front of it would be 'Rachel and the Case of the Missing Golf Clubs'.   wow, am I bored or what?  and my parents are gone too.  Too bad I don't have anyone to talk to.
You know you're obsessed when the first thing you do after you get payed is go to the camera shop and blow 50 bucks, and a whole hour, talking to the woman who owns the shop about different developing processes... which I did, today.  and I'm still very excited.  I can't wait to go home and try out my new filters. wow... that really is sad isn't it?  They asked me to do a reflection on my relationship with God for a whole bunch of Middle Schoolers tomorrow night.  Supposedly I'm good at this kind of thing.    So I have a lot of thinking to do between now and tomorrow night.  {Note:  I STILL have D.C. Sleeps stuck in my head...  Its been what two weeks now?}
I'm bored. nothing makes sense to me anymore.  I think I've lost my head. Perhaps I'm having a nervous breakdown... its quite likely actually.  Maybe that would explain what's been wrong with me for the past three weeks or so.
Look its my self portrait.  I'm scary.
lovely... just lovely
and as time passes, the wait grows longer the end seems less likely to come. is it worth it?
darn.  We didn't win the lottery.   I would have had fun with 216 million dollars.  that's a lot of money I think I'm going miniature golfing with St. Robert's youth group tonight.  I haven't been putt-putting in forever.  lol.  St. Robert's is adopting our youth group over the summer since Cindy went a got a job with the state so she can talk to kids with REAL problems. lol.  But yeah Pat (LPM) and Josh (RDL) have apparently volunteered me to help out at St. roberts with this middle schoolers thing every night next week, and play volleyball Sunday night.  yay.  I'm excited.  I missed volleyball.
its supposed to rain this afternoon, or tonight.  I wish I were home so I could go out in it and get soaked.  its so warm, this would be the perfect day for it.  lol... this fun.  look, Samantha's coming over saturday to teach me how to make guacamole... which looks like this:  lol.
::me messing with html again...::  {does it work?}  Hey, cool, it does.  i'm a genius.
Can you tell I'm bored? This is funny [>>>]    urlLink Barbecue anyone?   and my new favorite website {besides this one of course}  is simplyvintage.com   I want every t-shirt on the site.  lol.   Speaking of websites though, I also really like this one too.  Someday when I get really good at html, my site will look like this  urlLink Intensify   {but I'm doing ok for teaching myself dont you think?}
Poor Rachel. :-(  lol... she's a dork...  and a weirdo too. what is the world coming to?
think  happy  thoughts... {lol sound of music, favorite things... Rachel style} ...hmmm... late night conversations ;-) finding out something I didn't know before warm sunshine on my skin rain on my face sleeping in on Saturdays till noon zipping along in my car with the radio turned up ALL ThE WAY  {even though my speakers suck, so i can't turn the bass up all the way :-( } Bobby, when he's being a good cute sweet little brother {we're not even going to think about the bratty lil brother I've got sometimes... but ok... let me interject this story really quick.  Bobby has this program on his computer that came with a little camera, and lets you record and cut and edit video and all that, so he makes these movies with it.  He's getting really good at it.  the other day he did one that was a talent show, but it was all him, with different hats etc. on... lol  it was hysterical.  I can see it now, he's gonna be the next Steven Spielburg.... lol and I'll be nobody.}  anyway... moving on... happy thoughts... getting flowers, even if they are crazy colored and make me think I'm delusional watching the patterns of light change in the forest as the light filters down through the leaves being loved doing absolutely nothing and knowing that there isn't anything i should be doing while I'm doing nothing. {Not that that happens that often...  I should be doing other things right now...  like working... oh well} having money spending money knowing I'm really lucky and should be grateful for all of the above.  We're going to be in California the first full week of August.  I think we're leaving on the second. I think that'll be ok.  I miss people, but I'll get to spend time with my family, and we're going to go tide pooling...  Did you know those are some of the most diverse self-contained ecological systems in the world?   Can you tell I'm excited?   My dad thinks I should go and shoot all black and white film, and mess around with different filters and stuff.  I think I'm going to like this trip.   Maybe eventually I'll get my dad to set up my dark room for me and I can actually start on my college portfolio.
The wise man is he who possesses a torch of his own; He is the guide and leader of the caravan. That leader is his own director and light; That illuminated one follows his own lead. He is his own protector; do ye also seek protection From that light whereon his soul is nurtured. The second, he, namely, who is half wise, Knows the wise man to be the light of his eyes. He clings to the wise man like a blind man to his guide, So as to become possessed of the wise man's sight. But the fool, who has no particle of wisdom, Has no wisdom of his own, and quits the wise man. He knows nothing of the way, great or small, And is ashamed to follow the footsteps of the guide. He wanders into the boundless desert, Sometimes halting and despairing, sometimes running. He has no lamp wherewith to light himself on his way, Nor half a lamp which might recognise and seek light. He lacks wisdom, so as to boast of being alive, And also half wisdom, so as to assume to be dead. That half wise one became as one utterly dead In order to rise up out of his degradation. If you lack perfect wisdom, make yourself as dead Under the shadow of the wise, whose words give life. The fool is neither alive so as to companion with Isa, [=Jesus] Nor yet dead so as to feel the power of Isa's breath. His blind soul wanders in every direction, And at last makes a spring, but springs not upwards.                                    Rumi   I've got that song {D.C. Sleeps... The Postal Service} stuck in my head again. I need to get my hair trimmed again. I have piano tonight what do I need from the grocery store?
mm...  I was going to rant about time/clocks/watches... like what it says about our society that we are so dependent on time that we all carry little miniature clocks around on on our wrists {or in several other forms as well}  but I suppose thats just me being ridiculous {again}. I found a cool old watch in our basement yesterday, that's why i was thinking about it.  Anyway...  Lately I've been extremely jumpy, even for me.  My mom reached over and patted my arm at dinner last night and I MAJORLY freaked out.  It scared the crap out of me.  I woke up last night virtually in tears... I keep having these dreams that bad things are happening to the people I love, and there isn't anything I can do. {there isn't ever anything I can do... not even in the waking world}  I couldn't go back to sleep, every muscle in my body was tensed up... so much that I'm still sore.  once again, I wish there was a way I could prevent my dreams from coming.  I need real sleep.  I don't know when the last time I had real, solid sleep was. {well, I guess it was when I was heavily sedated last week... }
So, I guess its kind of like this... I already told you I've fallen to pieces, except the pieces are still together, just broken, and it takes every ounce of my being to hold the pieces together.  And every ounce of my being is tired {exhausted} of holding the pieces of me together.  I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE.  {too bad I don't have any other choice.} There isn't anything else left.  I know what could put me back together {two things actually}  but neither look about to happen in the near future.
this shade of red looks more and more like blood it doesn't matter now it doesn't I know what will happen it will be better that way don't tell me I'm being silly I know what will happen. Elizabeth?
...look at me... teaching myself html...  well, I suppose its half-way decent, isn't it?
My name is Rachel.  {duh, we already knew that.}  rachel is hebrew, and means ewe {ya know, like a mamma sheep} Ewe also somehow converts into meaning lamb, or mother...{those are other quote-unquote definitions of Rachel}  So, I'm supposed to be lamb-like, and motherly {I suppose that's rather amusing isn't it?}  so I was sitting here, looking at my name on the piece of paper in front of me, and I realized just how hebrew my name really is, I mean, look at it... Ra-chel...  those aren't normal syllables found in our language.  And since my name is hebrew, the language of the Israelis, or used to be the language of the israelis.. am I supposed to be devoted to the israelis, and scorn the palestinians?  {am i really jewish???} The more I look at it the weirder it looks. {rachel rachel rachel rachel rachel rachel rachel rachel}  Hey that [ wow... I'm psycho.
Another depressing song... I don't know why I like it.  I suppose you might call it mainstream but hey...  radiohead   There, There In pitch dark I go walking in your landscape Broken branches Trip me as I speak  Just cos you feel it Doesn't mean it's there Just cos you feel it Doesn't mean it's there  There's always a siren Singing you to shipwreck (Don't reach out, don't reach out Don't reach out, don't reach out) Stay away from each rocks We'd be a walking disaster (Don't reach out, don't reach out Don't reach out, don't reach out)  Just cos you feel it Doesn't mean it's there (Someone on your shoulder Someone on your shoulder) Just cos you feel it Doesn't mean it's there (Someone on your shoulder Someone on your shoulder) There there!  Why so green and lonely? Lonely, lonely  Heaven sent you to me To me, to me  We are accidents waiting Waiting to happen  We are accidents waiting Waiting to happen
I've been falling to pieces for the past several months, and I think I'm finally losing it.
I'm suffocating. My lungs are bursting. If you hit me,  I would pop like a brown paper lunch bag clenched in your fist. minus the air. inhale inhale inhale, shaky, like a child who's been sobbing on my shoulder for eternity. sigh... perhaps I'll float away, like a big red balloon. oxygen deprived, plenty of helium.   really... I am so incredibly odd...  I should not be allowed to sit around and think by myself, I turn rather insane.
peaches are the nectar of the gods.  mmmmmmmmm...  Sometimes, when I'm laying awake at night, in the ungodly hours of the twighlight morning, I forget things...  and remember other things I had forgotten before. I remember.  remembering isn't always a good thing. That's when I fall asleep, I fall asleep to forget again, before I do something I dare not. before I do something drastic.   I'm rather anxious about starting the new school year.  I want to know if its going to be  a good or bad year. I want to know how things are going to be now that they're different.
AHHH. I need a pillow to scream into. oh, and this book I'm reading?   guy's version of Briget Jones's Diary. its alright. when you're procrastinating, anything is alright. Do you miss me?
Young.  Really young.  I'd say anywhere from 15-35. But you'll go out with a bang.  You'll get in a car accident or be shot.  You'll never have to see yourself get old.  Sad though.  Really sad. By the way, its common knowledge that more people with great goals and aspirations die young.  And if you want to die old, you'll die young and vice versa.    urlLink   At what age will you die?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
that's Sama...


this one looks kinda cool squished like that...
yay for uploading my pics on to angelfire, and then putting them on my blog... except they're really big, and I have to resize them, and it distorts them a little. anyway, let me know what you think.
Ok, so this is the last time today, I promise...  I'm just being really REALLY good at procrastinating. Tomorrow, I will only post once, because I have five and a half pages to pull out of thin air. {that's a lot of work you know}  In a minute, I will go to my room and sit and read the book I am reading.  It's called 'my legendary girlfriend'  which is... quote-unquote 'a novel for those who have dumped, been dumped, or live in a dump.'  that in of itself was enough to get me to pick up this book at the library.  I've only read the first page though, so I can't tell you if I like it or not.  Speaking of books though... I thought this was interesting.  {I don't neccessarily agree, I just thought it was interesting.} ''So one time when I was working in this motel one of the toilets leaked and I have to replace the flapper ball.  Here's what it said on the package;  I kept it till I knew it by heart:  'Please Note.  Parts are included for all installations, but no installation requires all of the parts.'  That's kind of my philosophy about men.  I don't think there's an installation out there that could use all of my parts.'   Lou Ann covered her mouth to hide a laugh.  I wondered who had ever told her laughing was a federal offense. 'I'm serious, now.  I'm talkin mental capacity and everything, not just parts like what they cut a chicken into.'  By this time she was laughing out loud.... 'They can always use a breast or a thigh or a leg, but nobady wants the scroungy old neckbones!' 'Don't forget the wings,' I said.  'They always want to gobble up your wings right off the bat.''   The Bean Trees  Barbara Kingsolver  Isn't that interesting?  Rather ironic I suppose, but I love ironicizims... {yes I know I'm making up words, but hey, its my blog}  I need to go back and start reading Kurt Vonnegut again. Good-night.
oh, and I forgot...  last night at cantor practice... I consistantly hit a high F...  I can't begin to explain how excited I got.  That was the good part of last night.  Then it got bad, but that's ok.  I'm good now.
So, I got a new commenting host... I didn't like the old one, but I think I messed it up anyway... I put it in the wrong spot in my template... Silly Rachel...lol. anyway...
Last night was NOT a good night. {end of story} Today was... interesting. Anna Stewart is coming back.  I thought I was finally rid of her. .:sigh:. {maybe she's changed, and she's really a good person, and I shouldn't hold grudges against her...} London and Kate together... oh what a combination. If one more person asks me that god forsaken question...  I think I will drive my car into a brick wall at 150 mph.  Seriously... you're never done when you think you are.  I still have a huge paper to write. I am  procrastinating. :-)
Sometimes, I swear this song is about me. 3am  Matchbox Twenty  she say its cold outside and she hands me my raincoat  shes always worried about things like that  she says its all gonna end and it might as well be my fault  and she only sleeps when its raining  and she screams and her voice is straining   (chorus)  she says baby  its 3 am I must be lonely  when she says baby  well I cant help but be scared of it all sometimes  says the rains gonna wash away I believe it   shes got a little bit of something, God its better than nothing  and in her color portrait world she believes that shes got it all  she swears the moon dont hang quite as high as it used to  and she only sleeps when its raining  and she screams and her voice is straining   (chorus)   she believes that life is made up of all that youre used to  and the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days, and days  she thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway  but outside its stopped raining   (chorus)   Are you asleep?  would you tell me if you weren't?  what if I needed you right now?
so much for sleeping...  I know what time it is... I know what time it used to be. I think maybe I know what's happening. I think I just like pretending I know. I know how things are supposed to be, and by golly, I'm gonna make 'em that way.  Do you think reciting the things I think/know makes me feel better? Perhaps once they leak out of my head, I no longer have to think/know them. and then I can think/know other things. Perhaps. I like that word... its so hopeful, in a sort of not going to happen sort of way. Perhaps.
I am: a miserable failure incredibly irresponsible, late, never good enough, an ungrateful wretch, undeserving, unintelligent, not who you need me to be.  i'm sorry. I am so, so  sorry.
hey I've had almost 300 hits... WHO ARE ALL OF YOU PEOPLE????????????
This is that Sylvia Plath poem I was talking about.  Tulips                 Sylvia Plath        The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.      Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in   I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly   As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.   I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.   I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses   And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.   They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff      Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.   Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.   The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,   They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,   Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,   So it is impossible to tell how many there are.   My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water      Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.   They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.   Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage -   My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,   My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;   Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.   I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat      Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.   They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.   Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley   I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books   Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.   I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.   I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted      To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.   How free it is, you have no idea how free -   The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,   And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.   It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them   Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.   The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.      Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe   Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.   Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.   They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,   Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour,   A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.   Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.      The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me   Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,   And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow   Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,   And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.   The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.   Before they came the air was calm enough,      Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.   Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.   Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river   Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.   They concentrate my attention, that was happy   Playing and resting without committing itself.   The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.      The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;   They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,   And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes   Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.   The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,   And comes from a country far away as health.
So... I had another one of those dreams last night...  except this time it was {or at least I was telling myself it was} my fault.  Bobby and I were driving somewhere... on the highway, and all of a sudden a car come flying up an exit ramp, and of course, we were right at the end of the ramp, and I was boxed in, so there wasn't anywhere I could go.  It was like it was in slow motion, and I could see the car coming careening drunkenly at 100 miles an hour towards Bobby.{no not towards us... towards Bobby, that's what I was thinking.} The other car slammed into Bobby's side of the car, and we got pushed into the car on my side too... so I've got blood all over me, and I can see Bobby disgustingly mangled... so I pick up my cell phone, and call 911, but I'm so disoriented I have no idea where we are, so all I can do is cry   Help me, help me, help me help me help me, and then I blacked out.  Then I woke up in the hospital,and there were all these people in my room, and it was all white... {reminds me of a Sylvia Plath poem... I'll look it up  in a minute}  but the second I realized what happened I was screaming for Bobby... WHERE IS HE????  BOBBY  BOBBY... WHERE IS HE??  and everybody just sort of looked at each other, and somebody was said something like 'hes in a better place now...'  I was sobbing, sort of chanting under my breath... no.. no. no. no.. I woke up choking on my tears/screams... Its a good thing nobody was home to hear me.
mmm... strawberry tea for breakfast. Tomorrow I think I will be depressed.  Tomorrow is orientation...  which means I need to get my shiz-nit together, and stop being such a lazy bum...  which reminds me... I still have a TON of schtuff {MY WORD!} all over my room, and I have six pages to write before tuesday, AND I have to vacuum the downstairs for my mom... oh, and I need to wash my hair...{I got pancake batter in it this morning... just because I'm THAT GOOD!!!}  The other day, I was screwing around on the phone with Samantha doing the ditzy voice {yes also known as the 'Hi, I'm Baby, don't you wanna slap me?' voice... DON'T ask!}  and Sama was like... you're way too good at that... maybe its because that's like the anti-you, and you just have to get all that out of you somehow.... And some people would say that's the epitome of me.... hmmm.. yup, I'm rambling... I think I'll go now.
Yay for a new layout!!  Yeah, I know, I need to get more complicated eventually... but until I get the hang of this html stuff... oh and yes... that's me over there [>>>]
Ok, so I lied... Fed up isn't playing Friday night... Its The Underdog conspiracy... A Promised Victory, Falling Short, the Seventh Chapter, Rivendale, NOt Quite White and a Silent Ending are all playing at Rotary park... Its on vesper, off 7 hwy, if you need directions, email me, or call my cell {after nine... I used all my minutes talking to Sean for two hours earlier... :-)} umm... yeah... five days till school starts... UGH
well, today I went to church and talked to the music director for  two and a half hours... then I went and got my mom some lunch, and picked up my mom's book at the library.  When I got home I did laundry.  Sean came over at 5, and we hung out, and watched Moulin Rouge...  Amanda's having a show friday, Underdog Conspiracy, and Fed Up are playing, and I don't know who else, Amanda said six or seven bands... its from 5-10... you should all come.    I like daisies.
