13,5,"Tandulwadi trek","&lt;h1>🌄 &lt;strong>Tandulwadi Fort Trek – Hidden Gem of Palghar!&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Date of Trek&lt;/strong>: [Insert Date]&lt;/p>&lt;p> &lt;strong>Location&lt;/strong>: Tandulwadi Fort, Saphale, Palghar District, Maharashtra&lt;/p>&lt;p> &lt;strong>Difficulty Level&lt;/strong>: Moderate&lt;/p>&lt;p> &lt;strong>Total Duration&lt;/strong>: 2.5 – 3 hours (one way)&lt;/p>&lt;p> &lt;strong>Best Time to Visit&lt;/strong>: Monsoon or early winter (July – January)&lt;/p>&lt;h2>🏞️ &lt;strong>Intro – Why Tandulwadi?&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Sometimes, the best treks are the ones that don’t show up in every travel reel on Instagram. Tandulwadi Fort is one of those under-the-radar treks that surprises you with its raw beauty, peaceful vibe, and just the right amount of challenge. Nestled in the Palghar region near Saphale, this fort isn’t as famous as the Lohgad or Rajmachi, but it’s a true treat for nature lovers and solitude seekers.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;br>&lt;/p>&lt;h2>🚗 &lt;strong>How to Reach Tandulwadi Fort&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We took an early morning local from Mumbai to &lt;strong>Saphale&lt;/strong> station (Western Line). From there, we grabbed a rickshaw (₹100–₹120) to reach &lt;strong>Tandulwadi village&lt;/strong>, the base of the trek. If you're driving, the roads are pretty decent and there’s space to park at the base.&lt;/p>&lt;p>📍 &lt;em>Tip&lt;/em>: Carry cash – mobile networks can be spotty, and online payment isn’t always an option in the village.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;br>&lt;/p>&lt;h2>🥾 &lt;strong>The Trek Begins&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The trail starts from the village and passes through narrow lanes and fields before hitting the rocky base. The initial path is easy, with a steady incline and shade from trees. As you go higher, it opens up to breathtaking views of the valley, nearby forts like Kohoj, and the flowing rivers below.&lt;/p>&lt;p>By mid-trek, the terrain gets steeper, and the rocks can get slippery in the monsoon – good shoes are a must! No railing, no touristy signboards – just you, nature, and your breath catching up.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;br>&lt;/p>&lt;h2>🏯 &lt;strong>At the Top – What’s There?&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Don't expect a huge fort structure – Tandulwadi is more about the &lt;strong>views and the vibe&lt;/strong>. You’ll find remnants of old walls, water cisterns, and a few flat plateaus that offer 360-degree views of lush greenery and surrounding peaks. If you’re lucky, you might catch clouds drifting over the cliffs. It’s pure magic, especially after the rains.&lt;/p>&lt;p>📸 &lt;em>Must-click spots&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>The lone tree on the edge&lt;/li>&lt;li>The plateau with Kohoj Fort in the background&lt;/li>&lt;li>Fog rolling over the hills&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h2>🍱 &lt;strong>Food &amp; Essentials&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>There are no food stalls on the way or at the top. We packed light snacks, fruits, and lots of water. If you're planning a longer stay at the top, definitely carry your own tiffin. Locals might offer tea or poha at the base if you ask around.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Essentials to Carry&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>At least 2L water&lt;/li>&lt;li>Snacks / Energy bars&lt;/li>&lt;li>Trekking shoes with good grip&lt;/li>&lt;li>Cap / Sunglasses / Sunscreen&lt;/li>&lt;li>Raincoat (if going in monsoon)&lt;/li>&lt;li>Basic first-aid kit&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h2>💬 &lt;strong>Final Thoughts&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Tandulwadi isn’t about grandeur – it’s about the journey, the calm, and the feeling of being far away from city chaos. It’s ideal for a weekend escape, a group hike, or even a solo adventure if you're seasoned.&lt;/p>&lt;p>If you’re looking for a &lt;strong>non-crowded&lt;/strong>, scenic, and slightly challenging trek, &lt;strong>Tandulwadi&lt;/strong> deserves a spot on your list. 🌿&lt;/p>","2025-04-10 08:16:39",1
14,5,"Back to Roots","&lt;p>&lt;strong>Back to Roots: My Visit to Patgaon, Kolhapur&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;p>There’s a different kind of peace that settles in when you return to your native place. The air feels familiar, the trees seem to whisper stories you grew up with, and every corner holds a memory. Recently, I got the chance to visit my native village—&lt;strong>Patgaon&lt;/strong>, nestled in the lap of nature in &lt;strong>Kolhapur district, Maharashtra&lt;/strong>—and it was nothing short of soul-refreshing.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>A Warm Welcome&lt;/h3>&lt;p>As soon as I stepped foot in Patgaon, a wave of nostalgia hit me. The lush greenery, the chirping birds, the red soil—all felt like they had been waiting patiently for my return. Relatives greeted me with smiles that hadn’t changed over the years, and the aroma of home-cooked food made my heart full.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>The Charm of Simplicity&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Life in Patgaon moves at its own pace. Waking up to the sound of roosters and falling asleep under a sky full of stars—it’s a rhythm far removed from city life. I spent my days wandering through sugarcane fields, sitting by the river that runs near the village, and catching up with old friends and neighbors. Everyone had a story to tell, and every story brought a smile.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>Temple Visits &amp; Traditions&lt;/h3>&lt;p>No visit to Patgaon is complete without a stop at the &lt;strong>local temple&lt;/strong>. The serenity inside was calming, and lighting an oil lamp there felt like reconnecting with my roots. I was lucky to witness a local aarti ceremony—it reminded me how deeply spiritual and culturally rich our villages are.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>Kolhapuri Delights&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Being in Kolhapur, food was obviously a highlight. From spicy &lt;strong>Kolhapuri misal&lt;/strong> to the traditional &lt;strong>pitla-bhakri&lt;/strong>, every meal was a celebration. And yes, the taste of freshly churned buttermilk in earthen pots—unmatched! I also managed to bring back some famous &lt;strong>Kolhapuri jaggery&lt;/strong> and homemade pickles, because how could I not?&lt;/p>&lt;h3>Reflections&lt;/h3>&lt;p>My trip to Patgaon wasn’t just a vacation; it was a journey back in time. It reminded me of who I am, where I come from, and how important it is to stay connected to your roots. There’s something grounding about village life—it teaches you contentment, community, and the joy in simple things.&lt;/p>","2025-04-11 07:05:51",1
